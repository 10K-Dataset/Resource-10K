PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

General

Pinnacle West was incorporated in 1985 under the laws of the State of Arizona and owns all of
the outstanding equity securities of APS, its major subsidiary. APS is a vertically-integrated
electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the State of
Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson
metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona.

Pinnacle West’s other principal subsidiary is SunCor, which is engaged in real estate
development activities in the western United States. See “Business of SunCor Development Company”
in this Item 1. Pinnacle West’s other first-tier subsidiaries, APSES and El Dorado are discussed
in “Business of Other Subsidiaries” in this Item 1.

Pinnacle West Energy, which owned and operated unregulated generating plants, transferred the
PWEC Dedicated Assets to APS on July 29, 2005 and sold its 75% ownership interest in Silverhawk to
NPC on January 10, 2006. As a result, Pinnacle West Energy no longer owned any generating plants
and was dissolved as of August 31, 2006.



Business Segments

Pinnacle West has two principal business segments (determined by products, services and the
regulatory environment):

•

the regulated electricity segment (accounting for 93% of operating revenues in
2008), which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity
businesses (primarily electric service to Native Load customers) and related
activities, and includes electricity generation, transmission and distribution; and

•

the real estate segment (accounting for 4% of operating revenues in 2008), which
consists of SunCor’s real estate development and investment activities.

Electric power demand is generally a seasonal business. In Arizona, demand for power peaks
during the hot summer months. See Note 17 for financial information about the business segments.

APS ACC Proceedings

The key issue affecting Pinnacle West’s and APS’ financial outlook is adequate and timely
retail rate treatment by the ACC. See “2008 General Rate Case” in Note 3 for a discussion of APS’
pending retail rate case before the ACC.

Employees

At December 31, 2008, Pinnacle West employed approximately 7,500 people, including the
employees of its subsidiaries. Of these employees, approximately 6,900 were employees of APS,
including employees at jointly-owned generating facilities (approximately 3,300 employees) for
which APS serves as the generating facility manager. Approximately 600 people were employed by
Pinnacle West and its other subsidiaries. Pinnacle West’s principal executive offices are located
at 400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85004 (telephone 602-250-1000).

Forward-Looking Statements

This document contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and neither
Pinnacle West nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements or make any further
statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking
statements are often identified by words such as “estimate,” “predict,” “hope,” “may,” “believe,”
“anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “require,” “intend,” “assume” and similar words. Because actual
results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on
these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from
historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or
APS. In addition to the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this report, these factors include,
but are not limited to:





REGULATION AND COMPETITION

Retail

The ACC regulates APS’ retail electric rates and its issuance of securities. The ACC must
also approve any transfer or encumbrance of APS’ property used to provide retail electric service
and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between Pinnacle West, APS and
their respective affiliates.

APS is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investor-owned utilities in
Arizona (such as Southwest Gas Corporation), as well as cooperatives, municipalities, electrical
districts and similar types of governmental or non-profit organizations. In addition, some
customers, particularly industrial and large commercial customers, may own and operate generation
facilities to meet their own energy requirements.

In 1999, the ACC approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in
Arizona. As a result, as of January 1, 2001, all of APS’ retail customers were eligible to choose
alternate energy suppliers. However, there are currently no active retail competitors offering
unbundled energy or other utility services to APS’ customers. In 2000, an Arizona Superior Court
found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful, the latter
finding being primarily on procedural grounds, and invalidated all ACC orders authorizing
competitive electric services providers to operate in Arizona. In 2004, the Arizona Court of
Appeals invalidated some, but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders
authorizing competitive electric service providers. In 2005, the Arizona Supreme Court declined to
review the Court of Appeals decision.

To date, the ACC has taken no final or substantive action on either the rules or the prior
orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final Court of Appeals
decision. However, as a result of a new request for authorization to provide competitive retail
electric service by Sempra Energy Solutions, LLC, the ACC directed the ACC staff to investigate
whether such retail competition was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to
competition in light of the Court of Appeals decision referenced above. The ACC staff’s report on
the results of its investigation is due to be filed with the ACC on December 31, 2009. At present,
only limited electric retail competition exists in Arizona and only with certain entities not
regulated by the ACC. APS cannot predict when, and the extent to which, additional competitors
will re-enter APS’ service territory.

Wholesale

General

The FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services. See “Formula
Transmission Tariff” in Note 3 for information regarding APS’ transmission rates. During 2008,
approximately 6.3% of APS’ electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services. APS’
wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power risks in connection with
the costs of serving retail customer energy requirements. APS also sells, in the wholesale market,
its generation output that is not needed for APS’ Native Load and, in doing so, competes with other
utilities, power marketers and independent power producers. Additionally, subject to specified
parameters, APS markets, hedges and trades in electricity and fuels.



BUSINESS OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

General

APS was incorporated in 1920 under the laws of the State of Arizona and currently has
approximately 1.1 million customers. APS does not distribute any products. During 2008, no single
purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 1.8% of electric revenues. See “Overview” and
“Regulation and Competition” above for additional background information about APS.

At December 31, 2008, APS employed approximately 6,900 people, including employees at
jointly-owned generating facilities for which APS serves as the generating facility manager. APS’
principal executive offices are located at 400 North Fifth Street, P.O. Box 53999, Phoenix, Arizona
85072-3999 (telephone 602-250-1000).

Portfolio Resources

APS’ sources of energy during 2008 were: coal – 37.4%; nuclear – 24.2%; purchased power –
20.3%; and gas – 18.1%. In accordance with GAAP, a substantial portion of APS’ purchased power
expense is netted against wholesale sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 18.
The disclosure below provides a more detailed description of each of APS’ current sources of
energy.

Coal Fueled Generating Facilities

Four Corners

– Four Corners is a coal-fired power plant located in the northwestern corner of
New Mexico. APS operates the plant and owns 100% of Four Corners Units 1, 2 and 3 and 15% of Units
4 and 5. APS purchases all of Four Corners’ coal requirements from a supplier with a long-term
lease of coal reserves with the Navajo Nation. The Four Corners coal contract runs through 2016,
with options on APS’ part to extend the contract for five to fifteen additional years. The Four
Corners plant site is leased from the Navajo Nation and is also subject to an easement from the
federal government. See “Plant and Transmission Line Leases and Easements on Indian Lands” below
for additional information.

Cholla

– Cholla is a coal-fired power plant located in northeastern Arizona. APS operates
the plant and owns 100% of Cholla Units 1, 2 and 3. PacifiCorp owns Cholla Unit 4 and APS operates
that unit for PacifiCorp. Cholla’s common facilities are jointly owned by APS and PacifiCorp. APS
purchases most of Cholla’s coal requirements from coal suppliers that mine all of the coal under
long-term leases of coal reserves with the Navajo Nation, the federal government and private
landholders. There are currently two coal contracts in place with two separate suppliers for
Cholla. One supplier is ramping down its supply to the plant, which will be complete in 2009, and
the other is ramping up its supply to the plant to provide Cholla’s full coal requirement by 2010.
This agreement runs through 2024. Additionally, APS may purchase a portion of Cholla’s coal
requirements on the spot market to take advantage of competitive pricing options and to supplement
coal required for increased operating capacity. APS believes that the current fuel contracts and
competitive fuel supply options ensure the continued operation of Cholla for its useful life. In
addition, APS has a long-term coal transportation contract.

Navajo Generating Station

– The Navajo Generating Station is a coal-fired power plant located
in northern Arizona. Salt River Project operates the plant and APS owns a 14% interest in Navajo
Units 1, 2 and 3. The Navajo Generating Station’s coal requirements are purchased from a supplier
with long-term leases from the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. The Navajo Generating Station is
under contract with its coal supplier through 2011, with options to extend through 2019. The
Navajo Generating Station plant site is leased from the Navajo Nation and is also subject to an
easement from the federal government. See “Plant and Transmission Line Leases and Easements on
Indian Lands” below for additional information.

See Note 11 for information regarding APS’ coal mine reclamation obligations.

Natural Gas Fueled Generating Facilities

APS has seven natural gas power plants located throughout Arizona, consisting of Redhawk,
located near the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station; Ocotillo, located in Tempe; Sundance,
located in Coolidge; West Phoenix, located in southwest Phoenix; Saguaro, located north of Tucson;
Douglas, located in the town of Douglas; and Yucca, located near Yuma. APS owns and operates each
plant with the exception of one combustion turbine unit and one steam unit at Yucca that are
operated by APS and owned by the Imperial Irrigation District.



Nuclear Generating Facility

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station –

Palo Verde is a nuclear power plant located about 50
miles west of Phoenix, Arizona. APS operates the plant and owns 29.1% of Palo Verde Units 1 and 3
and about 17% of Unit 2. In addition, APS leases about 12.1% of Unit 2, resulting in a 29.1%
combined interest in that Unit. See “Palo Verde Leases” below for additional information regarding
the Palo Verde Unit 2 sale leaseback transactions.

Palo Verde Fuel Cycle –

The fuel cycle for Palo Verde is comprised of the following stages:

The Palo Verde participants are continually identifying their future resource needs and
negotiating arrangements to fill those needs. The Palo Verde participants have contracted for all
of Palo Verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates and conversion services through 2011. The
participants have also contracted for all of Palo Verde’s enrichment services through 2013 and all
of Palo Verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services until at least 2015.

Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal –

See “Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station” in Note
11 for a discussion of spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal.

Palo Verde Leases –

In 1986, APS sold about 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain
common facilities in three separate sale leaseback transactions. APS accounts for these leases as
operating leases. The leases, which have terms of 29.5 years, contain options to renew the leases
or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms. We are analyzing
this matter, and will continue to do so as we approach the end of the lease terms, to determine
which option or options to pursue. See Notes 9 and 20 for additional information regarding the
Palo Verde Unit 2 sale leaseback transactions.

Regulatory

–

Operation of each of the three Palo Verde units requires an operating license
from the NRC. The NRC issued full power operating licenses for Unit 1 in June 1985, Unit 2 in
April 1986 and Unit 3 in November 1987. The full power operating licenses, each valid for a period
of approximately 40 years, authorize APS, as operating agent for Palo Verde, to operate the three
Palo Verde units at full power. APS applied for renewed operating licenses for Palo Verde Unit 1,
Unit 2 and Unit 3 on December 15, 2008 for a period of 20 years beyond the expirations of the
current licenses. The NRC is currently reviewing the application.

NRC Inspection –

On February 22, 2007, the NRC issued a “white” finding (low to moderate
safety significance) due to electrical output issues with the Unit 3 emergency diesel generator
that occurred in 2006. Under the NRC’s Action Matrix, this finding, coupled with a previous NRC
“yellow” finding relating to a 2004 matter involving Palo Verde’s safety injection systems,
resulted in Palo Verde Unit 3 being placed in the “multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone” column
of the NRC’s Action Matrix (“Column 4”), which has resulted in an enhanced NRC inspection regime.



Although only Palo Verde Unit 3 is in NRC’s Column 4, in order to adequately assess the need
for improvements, APS’ management conducted site-wide assessments of equipment and operations.

On June 21, 2007, the NRC issued an initial confirmatory action letter confirming APS’
commitments regarding specific actions APS will take to improve Palo Verde’s performance. From
October 1, 2007 through November 2, 2007, a team of NRC inspectors performed on-site in-depth
inspections of Palo Verde’s equipment and operations. The NRC’s inspection results were documented
in an NRC letter to APS dated February 1, 2008 (the “Inspection Report”). The Inspection Report
indicated that the facility is being operated safely, but also identified certain performance
deficiencies. Based on its review of the APS Palo Verde improvement plan, the NRC issued a revised
confirmatory action letter (the “Revised CAL”) on February 15, 2008 that outlines the actions APS
must take in order for the NRC to return the Palo Verde site to the NRC’s routine inspection and
assessment process. This Revised CAL was anticipated as part of the NRC’s inspection procedure and
a substantial majority of the actions required therein was contained in APS’ improvement plan.

The NRC has continued to provide increased oversight at Palo Verde. The Palo Verde management
team has implemented a substantial majority of its improvement plan and has been subject to routine
periodic NRC inspections throughout 2008. On February 5, 2009, APS submitted a letter to the NRC
stating that it has completed a substantial majority of the actions contained in the Revised CAL
and believes the Revised CAL can be closed. APS will continue cooperating fully with the NRC
throughout this process and anticipates receiving a response from the NRC within the next several
months related to the closure of the Revised CAL.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

–

The NRC rules on financial assurance requirements for the
decommissioning of nuclear power plants provide that a licensee may use a trust as the exclusive
financial assurance mechanism if the licensee recovers estimated total decommissioning costs
through cost-of-service rates or through a “non-bypassable charge.” The “non-bypassable systems
benefits” charge is the charge that the ACC has approved for APS’ recovery of certain types of
costs. “Non-bypassable” means that if a customer chooses to take energy from an “energy service
provider” other than APS, the customer will still have to pay this charge as part of the customer’s
APS electric bill.

Other mechanisms are prescribed, including prepayment, if the requirements for exclusive
reliance on an external sinking fund mechanism are not met. APS currently relies on an external
sinking fund mechanism to meet the NRC financial assurance requirements for its interests in Palo
Verde Units 1, 2 and 3. The decommissioning costs of Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3 are currently
included in APS’ ACC jurisdictional rates. Decommissioning costs are recoverable through a
non-bypassable system benefits charge, which allows APS to maintain its external sinking fund
mechanism. See Note 12 for additional information about APS’ nuclear decommissioning costs.

Palo Verde Liability and Insurance Matters

– See “Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station” in
Note 11 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the Palo Verde participants, including APS,
for Palo Verde.

Alternative Generation Sources

In connection with its ongoing resource planning efforts, APS continues to focus on increasing
the percentage of its energy that is produced by renewable resources. On November 1,



2006, the ACC approved the Arizona Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (the “Renewable Energy
Standard”). Under the Renewable Energy Standard, electric utilities that are regulated by the ACC
must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable
resources, including solar, wind, biomass, biogas and geothermal technologies. The renewable
energy requirement increases from 1.5% in 2007 to 15% in 2025. The requirement for 2009 is 2.0%.
In addition, an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed
resources (generally speaking, small-scale renewable technologies that are located on customers’
properties). The distributed resource requirement increases from 5% of the overall renewable
energy requirement in 2007 to 30% in 2012 and subsequent years. The requirement for 2009 is 15%.
APS currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including wind, geothermal, solar and
biomass, which collectively generate over 120 MW of renewable energy for our customers. All of the
current renewable generation projects, except for solar, are acquired through long-term purchased
power agreements.

On February 8, 2008, APS entered into a Renewable Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement under
which APS agreed to purchase the energy and related renewable energy credits from a concentrated
solar power plant for a period of thirty years after the plant begins commercial operation. The
plant, which will have a nameplate rating of 280 MW and a projected annual output of 900,000 MWh,
will be located near Gila Bend, Arizona, which is about 70 miles southwest of Phoenix. The
agreement is subject to various conditions, including the developer obtaining project financing.
If these conditions are met, commercial operation is expected in 2012.

On February 28, 2008, APS signed a Renewable Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement under which
APS agreed to purchase the energy and related renewable energy credits from a wind power plant
located in New Mexico for a period of thirty years after the plant begins commercial operation in
2009. The plant has a nameplate rating of 100 MW and a projected annual output of 300,000 MWh.

APS continues to actively consider opportunities to enhance its renewable energy portfolio,
both to ensure its compliance with the Renewable Energy Standard and to meet the needs of its
customer base.

Purchased Power Agreements

In addition to its own available generating capacity, APS purchases electricity under various
arrangements. APS’ purchased power capacity under long-term contracts, as of December 31, 2008, is
summarized in the table below. APS also purchases power through short-term markets to supplement
its long-term resources and hedge its energy requirements.

(a)

The capacity under this agreement varies by month, with a maximum capacity of 90 MW.

(b)

The amount of electricity available to APS under this agreement is based in large part on
customer demand and is adjusted annually. Effective June 16, 2007, the seller, Salt River
Project, reduced the capacity available to APS by 150 MW. Additionally, Salt River Project
has elected to cancel this contract effective June 15, 2010.

(c)

This is a seasonal capacity exchange agreement with PacifiCorp. Under this agreement, APS
receives electricity from PacifiCorp during the summer peak season (from May 15 to September
15) and APS returns a like amount of electricity to PacifiCorp during the winter season (from
October 15 to February 15). Until 2020, APS and PacifiCorp each has 480 MW of capacity and a
related amount of energy available to it under the agreement for its respective seasons.
Additionally, under a supplemental energy sales agreement, APS must also make additional
offers of energy to PacifiCorp each year through October 31, 2020.

(d)

See “Alternative Generation Sources” above for more information.

APS continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system
reliability, although APS does not expect to need new capacity, beyond current plans, until around
2015. APS remains committed to seeking proposals from the competitive wholesale market for filling
its future resource needs, including renewable resource capacity.

Reserve Margin

APS’ 2008 peak one-hour demand on its electric system was recorded on August 1, 2008 at
7,025,900 kW, compared to the 2007 peak of 7,545,100 kW recorded on August 13, 2007. Taking into
account additional capacity then available to APS under long-term purchase power contracts, as well
as APS’ generating capacity, APS’ capability of meeting system demand on August 1, 2008, amounted
to 6,883,000 kW, for an installed reserve margin of negative 2.3%. The power actually available to
APS from its resources fluctuates from time to time due in part to planned and unplanned



plant and transmission outages and technical problems. The available capacity from sources
actually operable at the time of the 2008 peak amounted to 5,831,000 kW, for a margin of negative
21.9%. Firm purchases totaling 2,626,000 kW, including short-term seasonal purchases and unit
contingent purchases, were in place at the time of the peak, ensuring the ability to meet the load
requirement with an actual reserve margin of 20.6%.

Resource Plan

On January 29, 2009, APS submitted a Resource Plan Report to the ACC proposing a diverse
portfolio of generation resources to address the projected 60% increase in customer peak demand by
2025, which equates to approximately 6,500 MW of new capacity resources and accounts for both new
resources needed to meet growing customers loads as well as resources that will be needed to
replace expiring long-term purchases. The primary components of the Resource Plan include:

•

Energy efficiency initiatives;

•

The acceleration of renewable energy sources by doubling the Renewable Energy
Standard Requirement in 2015, resulting in the addition of over 1,650 MW of renewable
resources by 2025;

•

The potential for an addition of new baseload nuclear capacity after 2020 of up to
800 MW of capacity; and

•

Peaking resources based on gas-fired resources, whether through wholesale purchases
or the construction or acquisition of peaking capacity and/or potential additional
deployment of demand response opportunities.

The Resource Plan would allow Arizona to increase its commitment to non-fossil fuel resources
because it does not include new coal-fired generation resources. The Resource Plan states that the
risk of future climate change legislation and the resulting potential for significant increases in
cost currently make coal-fired generation an unattractive resource choice. The Resource Plan also
addresses the transmission infrastructure expansion that will be required to accommodate the new
resources.

Under the Resource Plan, APS’ energy mix would change. Nuclear energy would increase to 32%
of its mix,  renewable energy sources would increase to 16%, and
energy efficiency would increase to 7%. Coal-fired energy would decrease to 24% and gas-fired generation would decrease to  21%.

APS has requested the ACC to (a) either formally approve the Resource Plan or acknowledge that
APS has considered all relevant resources, risks and uncertainties and that the Resource Plan is
reasonable and in the public interest; (b) determine that the pursuit of renewable resources above
the Renewable Energy Standard is in the public interest; (c) determine that taking the initial
steps to preserve APS’ ability to pursue a new nuclear baseload resource is in the public interest;
and (d) determine that it is appropriate for APS to proceed to implement the Resource Plan. APS
cannot predict the outcome of this matter.



Transmission and Distribution Facilities

APS’ transmission facilities consist of approximately 5,825 pole miles of overhead lines and
approximately 45 miles of underground lines, 5,601 miles of which are located in Arizona. APS’
distribution facilities consist of approximately 11,392 miles of overhead lines and approximately
16,630 miles of underground primary cable, all of which are located in Arizona. APS shares
ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies. The following table shows
APS’ jointly-owned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at December 31, 2008:

Plant and Transmission Line Leases and Easements on Indian Lands

The Navajo Generating Station and Four Corners are located on land held under leases from the
Navajo Nation and also under easements from the federal government. The easement and lease for the
Navajo Generating Station expire in 2019 and the easement and lease for Four Corners expire in
2016. Each of the leases contains an option to extend for an additional 25-year period from the
end of the existing lease term, for a rental amount tied to the original rent payment adjusted
based on an index. The easements do not contain an express renewal option and it is unclear what
conditions to renewal or extension of the easements may be imposed. The ultimate cost of renewal
of the Navajo Generating Station and Four Corners leases and easements is uncertain. As noted
above under “Portfolio Resources – Coal Fueled Generating Facilities,” the coal contracted for use
in these plants is also located on Indian reservations.

Certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants
are located on Indian lands pursuant to easements or other rights-of-way that are effective for
specified periods. Some of these rights-of-way have expired and our renewal applications have not
yet been acted upon by the appropriate Indian tribes. Other rights expire at various times in the
future and renewal action by the applicable tribe will be required at that time. The majority of
our transmission lines residing on Indian lands are on the Navajo Nation. The Four Corners and
Navajo Generating Station plant leases provide Navajo Nation consent to certain of the
rights-of-way for transmission lines related to those plants at a specified rental rate for the
original term of the rights-of-way and for a like payment in any renewal period. In addition, a
1985 amendment to the leases provides a formula for calculating payments for certain new and
renewal rights-of-way. However, some of our rights-of-way are not covered by the leases, or are
granted by other Indian tribes. In recent negotiations with other utilities or companies for
renewal of similar rights-of-way, certain of the affected Indian tribes have required payments
substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rights-of-way or that are
typical for similar permits across non-Indian lands; however, we are unaware of the underlying
agreements and/or specific circumstances surrounding these renewals. The ultimate cost of renewal
of the rights-of-way for our transmission lines is



uncertain. We are monitoring these rights-of-way and easement issues and have initiated
discussions with the Navajo Nation regarding them. We are currently unable to predict the outcome
of this matter.

Environmental Matters

EPA Environmental Regulation

Regional Haze Rules

On April 22, 1999, the EPA announced final regional haze rules. These
regulations required states to submit state implementation plans (SIPs) by December 2007 to
demonstrate “reasonable progress” towards achieving natural visibility conditions in certain “Class
I Areas,” including several on the Colorado Plateau. SIPs are required to consider and potentially
apply “best available retrofit technology” (BART) for certain older major stationary sources. The
rules allow nine western states and Indian tribes to follow an alternate implementation plan and
schedule for the Class I Areas. This alternate implementation plan is known as the Annex Rule.

On June 15, 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule, which amends the 1999 regional
haze rules by providing guidelines, known as the BART guidelines, for states to use in determining
which facilities must install controls and the type of controls the facilities must use. The EPA
also issued a Revised Annex Rule on October 13, 2006 to address a previous challenge and court
remand of that rule.

ADEQ is currently undertaking a rulemaking process to amend its SIP to reconcile it with the
Revised Annex Rule and to implement the Clean Air Visibility Rule requirements. ADEQ’s Regional
Haze SIPs were due to EPA Region 9 in December 2007, but are actually expected to be submitted
during 2009. As part of the rulemaking process, ADEQ is requiring certain sources in the state to
conduct BART analyses. Cholla and West Phoenix received letters from ADEQ asserting that the
plants are potentially subject to BART and requesting that we either perform a BART analysis on
each plant or provide information demonstrating that we are not subject to BART. We completed a
BART analysis for Cholla and submitted our BART recommendations to ADEQ on February 4, 2008. Our
recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that we believe
constitutes BART. Once we receive ADEQ’s final determination as to what constitutes BART for
Cholla, we will have five years to complete the installation of the equipment and to achieve the
emission limits established by ADEQ. However, in order to coordinate with the plant’s other
scheduled activities, we are currently implementing portions of our recommended plan for Cholla on
a voluntary basis. Costs related to the implementation of these portions of our recommended plan
are included in our environmental expenditure estimates (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Capital Expenditures” in Item 7).

Because we believed that ADEQ’s baseline modeling for West Phoenix may have contained some
errors, we re-performed the baseline modeling using correct input and have determined that West
Phoenix is not subject to BART. We submitted these findings for West Phoenix to ADEQ, and ADEQ has
verbally informed us that West Phoenix is not subject to BART.

In addition, EPA Region 9 requested us to perform a BART analysis for Four Corners. We
completed the analysis and submitted it to the EPA on January 30, 2008. In December 2008, we
provided additional data in response to a request from the EPA. Our recommendations include the
installation of certain pollution control equipment that we believe constitutes BART. Once we



receive the EPA’s final determination as to what constitutes BART for Four Corners, we will
have five years to complete the installation of the equipment and to achieve the emission limits
established by EPA Region 9. However, in order to coordinate with the plant’s other scheduled
activities, we will begin implementing initial portions of our recommended plan later this year for
Four Corners on a voluntary basis. Costs related to the implementation of these portions of our
recommended plan are included in our environmental expenditure estimates (see “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Capital Expenditures” in
Item 7).

While we continue to monitor this matter, at the present time we cannot predict whether the
agencies will agree with our BART recommendations or, if the agencies disagree with our
recommendations, the nature of the BART controls the agencies may ultimately mandate and the
resulting financial or operational impact.

Mercury

On March 15, 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) to control
mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. This rule establishes performance standards
limiting mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants and establishes a two phased market-based
emissions trading program. Under the trading program, the EPA has assigned each state a mercury
emissions “budget” and each state must submit to the EPA a plan detailing how it will meet its
“budget.”

In November 2006, ADEQ submitted a SIP to the EPA to implement the CAMR. ADEQ’s SIP generally
incorporates the EPA’s model cap-and-trade program, but it includes additional requirements,
including the requirement to meet a 90% mercury removal control level or 0.0087 lbs/GWh, whichever
is greater, the requirement to obtain mercury allowances at a 2:1 ratio for any emissions that fall
below the specified control level, and the requirement, beginning in 2013, to consider clean coal
technologies as part of permitting any new generation.

On February 8, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the CAMR and the
EPA rule that allowed for the creation of the CAMR, and on March 14, 2008, the court issued the
mandate to vacate these rules. On May 20, 2008, the D.C. Circuit denied the EPA’s request to
reconsider its decision. On October 17, 2008, the U.S. Solicitor General, on behalf of the EPA,
petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the D.C. Circuit
Court of Appeals’ vacatur of the CAMR. In filing the petition, the U.S. contended, among other
things, that the Court of Appeals’ decision “effectively divests EPA of the discretion that
Congress conferred on the agency to consider alternative regulatory approaches to combating air
pollution from power plants.” Unless and until this decision is overturned, the law in effect
prior to the adoption of the CAMR becomes the applicable law, and requires the EPA to develop an
emission limit for mercury that represents the maximum achievable control technology. It is
expected to take the EPA several years to establish its standard, followed by a period of several
years during which existing plants would implement any controls needed to comply with the standard.

The court’s ruling also invalidates CAMR-based portions of ADEQ’s mercury rule (the trading
provisions of the rule), although the state-only emission limits remain in effect. On July 25,
2008, the Arizona Utilities Group (comprised of APS, Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, Salt River
Project, Tucson Electric Power Company, and Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association)
filed with ADEQ a Petition for Reconsideration and Repeal of the state mercury rule. The petition
asserts that ADEQ does not have statutory authority to administer and enforce the state mercury
rule, in light of the vacatur of the CAMR and the requirement that EPA promulgate a Maximum
Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) standard. ADEQ granted the petition in part



and agreed to begin rulemaking efforts to repeal those portions of ADEQ’s mercury rule that
are no longer valid in light of the vacatur of the federal CAMR. However, ADEQ denied the petition
with respect to certain compliance deadlines and, unless the Arizona Utilities Group reaches an
agreement with ADEQ on revisions to the state mercury rule, APS and others will have to comply with
the 90% mercury removal or 0.0087 lbs/GWh levels discussed above by
2013. On February 17, 2009,
APS signed a consent order with ADEQ under which APS will strive to achieve 50% mercury removal
commencing in 2011 and will fully comply with the ADEQ mercury rule by 2016, rather than by 2013 as
the rule currently prescribes.

While we continue to monitor this matter, we cannot predict the final outcome of the petition
to the Supreme Court, additional actions by ADEQ resulting from the federal court’s decision or the
Arizona Utilities Group petition, or the scope, timing or impact of any alternate rules that may be
enacted to address mercury emissions.

We have installed, and continue to install, certain of the equipment necessary to meet the
current mercury standards. However, due to the U.S. Court of Appeals decision described above, we
will monitor the type and timing of any necessary equipment installation. The estimated costs
expected to be incurred over the next three years for such equipment are included in our
environmental expenditure estimates (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation – Capital Expenditures” in Item 7).

Federal Implementation Plan

In September 1999, the EPA proposed FIPs to set air quality
standards at certain power plants, including Four Corners and the Navajo Generating Station. On
September 12, 2006, the EPA proposed revised FIPs to establish air quality standards at both of
these plants.

Four Corners FIP

On April 30, 2007, the EPA adopted a source specific FIP to set air quality standards at Four
Corners. The FIP essentially federalizes the requirements contained in the New Mexico State
Implementation Plan, which Four Corners has historically followed. The FIP also includes a
requirement to maintain and enhance dust suppression methods. On July 2, 2007, APS filed a
petition for review in the United States District Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit seeking
revisions to the FIP to clarify certain requirements and allow operational flexibility. The Sierra
Club intervened in this action. On July 6, 2007, the Sierra Club and other parties filed a
petition for review with the same court challenging the FIP’s compliance with the Clean Air Act and
we have intervened in their action. In our lawsuit, we challenge two key provisions of the FIP: a
20% opacity limit on certain fugitive dust emissions, which the EPA filed a motion to remand and
vacate in early December 2007, and a 20% stack opacity limit on Units 4 and 5. Briefing in this
case is now complete, and oral arguments as requested by the EPA were completed in May 2008. After
briefing was completed, the EPA voluntarily moved to vacate the fugitive dust provisions of the
FIP. The court has not yet ruled on that motion; however, in light of that motion, APS asked for,
and the EPA granted, an administrative stay of the fugitive dust provisions, and the Navajo Nation
EPA amended our Four Corners permit to specify that those requirements do not apply unless and
until the court denies the EPA’s motion. Although we cannot predict the outcome or the timing of
these matters, we do not believe that they will have a material adverse impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.



Navajo Generating Station FIP

The proposed FIP for the Navajo Generating Station is still pending. APS cannot currently
predict the effect of this proposed FIP on its financial position, results of operations or cash
flows, or whether the proposed FIP will be adopted in its current form.

Superfund

Superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found
contaminating the soil, water or air. Those who generated, transported or disposed of hazardous
substances at a contaminated site are among those who are PRPs. PRPs may be strictly, and often
jointly and severally, liable for clean-up. On September 3, 2003, the EPA advised APS that the EPA
considers APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52

nd

Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3
(OU3) in Phoenix, Arizona. APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site. APS and
Pinnacle West have agreed with the EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS
facilities within OU3. Because the investigation has not yet been completed and ultimate
remediation requirements are not yet finalized, at the present time neither APS nor Pinnacle West
can accurately estimate the expenditures that may be required.

By letter dated April 25, 2008, the EPA informed APS that it may be a PRP in the Gila River
Indian Reservation Superfund Site in Maricopa County, Arizona. APS, along with three other electric
utility companies, owns a parcel of property on which a transmission pole and a portion of a
transmission line are located. The property abuts the Gila River Indian Community boundary and, at
one time, may have been part of an airfield where crop dusting took place. Currently, the EPA is
only seeking payment from APS and four other PRPs for past cleanup-related costs involving
contamination from the crop dusting. Based upon the total amount of cleanup costs reported by the
EPA in its letter to APS, we do not expect that the resolution of this matter will have a material
adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

APS is currently investigating properties, which it now owns or
which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors, that were at one time sites of, or
sites associated with, manufactured gas plants. APS is taking action to voluntarily remediate
these sites. APS does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.

Navajo Nation Environmental Issues

Four Corners and the Navajo Generating Station are located on the Navajo Reservation and are
held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the Navajo Nation.
See “Portfolio Resources – Coal Fueled Generating Facilities” above for additional information
regarding these plants.

In July 1995, the Navajo Nation enacted the Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control
Act, the Navajo Nation Safe Drinking Water Act and the Navajo Nation Pesticide Act (collectively,
the “Navajo Acts”). The Navajo Acts purport to give the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection
Agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality, drinking water and pesticide
activities, including those activities that occur at Four Corners and the Navajo Generating
Station. On October 17, 1995, the Four Corners participants and the Navajo Generating Station
participants each filed a lawsuit in the District Court of the Navajo Nation, Window Rock District,
challenging the applicability of the Navajo Acts as to Four Corners and the Navajo Generating



Station. The Court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties, and the
parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement.

In April 2000, the Navajo Tribal Council approved operating permit regulations under the
Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act. APS believes the regulations fail to
recognize that the Navajo Nation did not intend to assert jurisdiction over Four Corners and the
Navajo Generating Station. On July 12, 2000, the Four Corners participants and the Navajo
Generating Station participants each filed a petition with the Navajo Supreme Court for review of
the operating permit regulations. Those proceedings have been stayed, pending the settlement
negotiations mentioned above. APS cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter.

On May 18, 2005, APS, Salt River Project, as the operating agent for the Navajo Generating
Station, and the Navajo Nation executed a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (“VCA”) to resolve their
disputes regarding the Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act. On March 21, 2006,
the EPA determined that the Navajo Nation was eligible for “treatment as a state” for the purpose
of entering into a supplemental delegation agreement with the EPA to administer the Clean Air Act
Title V, Part 71 federal permit program over Four Corners and the Navajo Generating Station. The
EPA entered into the supplemental delegation agreement with the Navajo Nation on the same day.
Because the EPA’s approval was consistent with the requirements of the VCA, APS sought dismissal of
the pending litigation in the Navajo Nation Supreme Court, as well as the pending litigation in the
Navajo Nation District Court to the extent the claims relate to the Clean Air Act, and the Courts
have dismissed the claims accordingly. The agreement does not address or resolve any dispute
relating to other Navajo Acts. APS cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter.

Water Supply

Assured supplies of water are important for APS’ generating plants. At the present time, APS
has adequate water to meet its needs. However, conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in
the southwestern United States have resulted in numerous court actions.

Both groundwater and surface water in areas important to APS’ operations have been the subject
of inquiries, claims and legal proceedings, which will require a number of years to resolve. APS
is one of a number of parties in a proceeding, filed March 13, 1975, before the Eleventh Judicial
District Court in New Mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for Four
Corners is derived. An agreement reached with the Navajo Nation in 1985, however, provides that if
Four Corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication, the Navajo Nation will provide, for
an agreed upon cost, sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss.

A summons served on APS in early 1986 required all water claimants in the Lower Gila River
Watershed in Arizona to assert any claims to water on or before January 20, 1987, in an action
pending in Maricopa County, Arizona, Superior Court. Palo Verde is located within the geographic
area subject to the summons. APS’ rights and the rights of the other Palo Verde participants to
the use of groundwater and effluent at Palo Verde are potentially at issue in this action. As
operating agent of Palo Verde, APS filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the Palo
Verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to Palo
Verde. Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights. Five of APS’ other power plants are
also located within the geographic area subject to the summons. APS’ claims dispute the court’s
jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants. Alternatively, APS seeks



confirmation of such rights. In November 1999, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision
confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and Indian
tribes. In addition, in September 2000, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision affirming the
lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims. Litigation on both of these issues has
continued in the trial court. In December 2005, APS and other parties filed a petition with the
Arizona Supreme Court requesting interlocutory review of a September 2005 trial court order
regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights.
The Court denied the petition in May 2007, and the trial court is now proceeding with
implementation of its 2005 order. No trial date concerning APS’ water rights claims has been set
in this matter.

APS has also filed claims to water in the Little Colorado River Watershed in Arizona in an
action pending in the Apache County, Arizona, Superior Court, which was originally filed on
September 5, 1985. APS’ groundwater resource utilized at Cholla is within the geographic area
subject to the adjudication and, therefore, is potentially at issue in the case. APS’ claims
dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights. Alternatively, APS seeks
confirmation of such rights. A number of parties are in the process of settlement negotiations
with respect to certain claims in this matter. Other claims have been identified as ready for
litigation in motions filed with the court. No trial date concerning APS’ water rights claims has
been set in this matter.

Although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation, APS does not expect that the
described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of
operations, cash flows or liquidity.

The Four Corners region, in which Four Corners is located, has been experiencing drought
conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in
the watershed that supplies the area. APS is continuing to work with area stakeholders to
implement agreements to minimize the effect, if any, on future operations of the plant. The effect
of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time, and APS cannot predict the ultimate outcome,
if any, of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available,
or the price thereof, from Four Corners.

Climate Change

Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives.

In the past several years, the United States Congress
has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions, but such bills have not
yet received sufficient Congressional approval to become law; however, there is growing consensus
that some form of regulation or legislation is likely to occur in the near future at the federal
level with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. In 2007, the United States Supreme Court ruled
that greenhouse gases fit within the Clean Air Act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and, as a
result, the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under
the Clean Air Act. The court held that the only way the EPA can avoid regulating greenhouse gases
is if it determines that the emissions do not contribute to climate change, or if the EPA provides
a reasonable explanation for why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to regulate these
emissions. While this decision applies only to emissions from new motor vehicles, if the EPA
determines that greenhouse gas emissions can reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or
welfare, this determination will likely impact other Clean Air Act programs as well, and could
potentially result in new regulatory requirements for our power plants.



In addition to federal legislative initiatives, state specific initiatives may also impact our
business. While Arizona has not yet enacted any state specific legislation regarding greenhouse
gas emissions, AB 32 is a California statute mandating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to
1990 levels by 2020. In December 2008, the California Air Resources Board issued a final scoping
plan which is intended to form the basis of rules required under AB 32. On January 1, 2012, the
regulations based on the 2009 scoping plan will become effective. We are monitoring this and other
state legislative developments to evaluate whether, and the extent to which, any resulting statutes
or rules in California or other states may affect our business, including our sales into the
impacted states or the ability of our out-of-state power plant participants to meet their
obligations.

If any emission reduction legislation or regulations are enacted, we will assess our
compliance alternatives, which may include replacement of existing equipment, installation of
additional pollution control equipment, purchase of allowances, curtailing certain operations, or
other actions. Although associated capital expenditures or operating costs resulting from
greenhouse gas emission regulations or legislation could be material, we believe that we would be
able to recover the costs of these environmental compliance initiatives through our rates.

Regional Initiative.

In 2007, six western states (Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oregon,
Utah and Washington) and two Canadian provinces (British Columbia and Manitoba) entered into an
accord, the Western Climate Initiative (the “Initiative”), to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from
automobiles and certain industries, including utilities. Montana, Quebec and Ontario have also
joined the Initiative. In August 2007, the Initiative participants set a goal of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions 15% below 2005 levels by 2020. Since May 2008, several draft documents
have been issued for public comment. We are reviewing the recommendations and requirements in
these documents, which currently provide only a general framework for the proposed program. Over
the next year, the Initiative participants intend to develop detailed rules to more fully establish
and define the program. Since details are not yet available, such as the number of allowances each
source may receive, we are unable to quantify the potential financial and operational impacts on
our business. In addition, we believe that the implementation of any such program in Arizona would
require legislative action. As a result, while we continue to monitor the progress and impact of
the Initiative, at the present time we cannot predict what detailed form it will ultimately take,
whether it will be implemented or, if it is implemented, what impact it will have on our
operations.

Company Response to Climate Change Initiatives.

We have undertaken a number of initiatives to
address emission concerns, including renewable energy procurement and development, promotion of
programs and rates related to energy conservation, renewable energy use and energy efficiency, and
implementation of an active technology innovation effort to evaluate potential emerging new
technologies. APS currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including wind,
geothermal, solar and biomass and we are focused on increasing the percentage of our energy that is
produced by renewable resources. (See “Portfolio Resources – Alternative Generation Sources”
above.) In January 2009, we submitted a Resource Plan Report to the ACC proposing our future plans
for additional diverse resources. See “Portfolio Resources – Resource Plan” above for information
regarding the Resource Plan Report, which was designed, in part, to increase Arizona’s commitment
to non-fossil resources.

In addition, we are currently developing a Climate Management Report to comply with an ACC
order that directed APS to undertake a climate management plan, carbon emission reduction study and
commitment and action plan with public input and ACC review. We expect to complete the report in
early 2009.



In January 2008, APS joined the Climate Registry as a Founding Reporter. Founding Reporters
are companies that voluntarily joined the non-profit organization before May 2008 to measure and
report greenhouse gas emissions in a common, accurate and transparent manner consistent across
industry sectors and borders. Pinnacle West has also reported, and will continue to report,
greenhouse gas emissions in its annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which is available on our
website

(

www.pinnaclewest.com

)

. In addition to emissions data, the report provides
information related to the Company, its approach to sustainability and its workplace and
environmental performance. The information on Pinnacle West’s website, including the Corporate
Responsibility Report, is not incorporated by reference into this report.

SunCor was incorporated in 1965 under the laws of Arizona and is a developer of residential,
commercial and industrial real estate projects in Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico and Utah. The
principal executive offices of SunCor are located at 80 East Rio Salado Parkway, Suite 410, Tempe,
Arizona 85281 (telephone 480-317-6800). SunCor and its subsidiaries had approximately 480
employees at December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2008, SunCor had total assets of about $547 million. SunCor’s assets consist
primarily of land with improvements, commercial buildings, golf courses and other real estate
investments. SunCor focuses on real estate development of master-planned communities, and
mixed-use residential, commercial, office and industrial projects.

SunCor projects include six master-planned communities and several commercial and residential
projects. Four of the master-planned communities and the commercial and residential projects are
in Arizona. Other master-planned communities are located in Idaho, New Mexico and Utah.

SunCor’s operating revenues were approximately $131 million in 2008, $213 million in 2007 and
$400 million in 2006. SunCor’s net loss was approximately $26 million in 2008. SunCor’s net loss
in 2008 included a $53 million (pre-tax) real estate impairment charge. SunCor’s net income was
approximately $24 million in 2007 and $61 million in 2006. Certain components of SunCor’s real
estate sales activities, which are included in the real estate segment, are required to be reported
as discontinued operations on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.” See Notes 22 and
23.

See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Other Subsidiaries – SunCor” in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 for a
discussion of SunCor’s long-term debt, liquidity and capital requirements.

BUSINESS OF OTHER SUBSIDIARIES

APSES was incorporated in 1998 under the laws of Arizona and provides energy-related products
and services (such as energy master planning, energy use consultation and facility audits,
cogeneration analysis and installation, and project management) and competitive commodity-related
energy services (such as direct access commodity contracts, energy procurement and energy supply
consultation) to commercial and industrial retail customers in the western United States.
Recently, APSES has discontinued its commodity-related energy services (see Note 22). APSES had



approximately 60 employees as of December 31, 2008. APSES’ principal offices are located at 60 E.
Rio Salado Parkway, Suite 1001, Tempe, Arizona 85281 (telephone 602-744-5060).

APSES had a net loss of $1 million in 2008, a net loss of $4 million in 2007 and a net loss of
$3 million in 2006. At December 31, 2008, APSES had total assets of $70 million.

El Dorado was incorporated in 1983 under the laws of Arizona. El Dorado owns minority
interests in several energy-related investments and Arizona community-based ventures. El Dorado’s
short-term goal is to prudently realize the value of its existing investments. On a long-term
basis, Pinnacle West may use El Dorado, when appropriate, for investments that are strategic to the
business of generating, distributing and marketing electricity. El Dorado’s offices are located at
400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85004 (telephone 602-250-3517).

loss of $4 million in 2006. Income taxes related to El Dorado are recorded by Pinnacle West. At
December 31, 2008, El Dorado had total assets of $28 million.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection
with the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report, set forth below are
risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. Unless otherwise indicated or the
context otherwise requires, the following risks and uncertainties apply to Pinnacle West and its
subsidiaries, including APS.

APS is subject to comprehensive government regulation by several federal, state and local
regulatory agencies that could have a material adverse impact on its business, liquidity and
results of operations.

APS is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal, state and local regulatory
agencies that significantly influence its business, liquidity and results of operations. The ACC
regulates APS’ retail electric rates and APS’ issuance of securities. The ACC must also approve
any transfer of APS’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior
notification of certain transactions between us, APS and our respective affiliates. While approved
electric rates are intended to permit APS to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable
rate of return, the profitability of APS is affected by the rates it may charge. Consequently, our
financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of
APS’ retail rate proceedings and ancillary matters which are before or which may come before the
ACC. Decisions made by the ACC could have a material adverse impact on
our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

APS is required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the agencies that
regulate APS’ business. The FERC, the NRC, the EPA, and the ACC regulate many aspects of our
utility operations, including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and, as noted
in the preceding paragraph, the rates that APS can charge customers. We believe the necessary
permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for APS’ existing operations and that APS’
business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects. However,
changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on
our results of operations. We are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating
results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies.



The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related
requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of noncompliance,
the NRC has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased
inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit, or both, depending upon
the NRC’s assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. In early
2007, the NRC placed Palo Verde Unit 3 in the “multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone” column of
the NRC’s Action Matrix (“Column 4”), which has resulted in an enhanced NRC inspection regime,
including on-site in-depth inspections of Palo Verde equipment and operations. Although only Palo
Verde Unit 3 is in NRC’s Column 4, in order to adequately assess the need for improvements, APS
management has been conducting site-wide assessments of equipment and operations. APS continues to
cooperate fully with the NRC throughout this process. The enhanced NRC inspection regime and APS’
ongoing commitment to the conservatively safe operation of Palo Verde could result in NRC action or
an APS decision to shut down one or more units in the event of noncompliance with operating
requirements or in light of other operational considerations.

APS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may increase its cost of
operations, impact its business plans, or expose it to environmental liabilities.

APS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its
present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid
waste, hazardous waste, and coal combustion products, which consist of bottom ash, fly ash and air
pollution control wastes. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating,
and other costs, particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions
obligations. These laws and regulations generally require APS to obtain and comply with a wide
variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay
in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval, or if APS fails to obtain, maintain or
comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to
additional expenses. In addition, failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and
regulations could result in civil liability or criminal penalties. Both public officials and
private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations. We cannot
predict the outcome (financial or operational) of any related litigation that may arise.

In addition, we may be a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a
regulatory body. We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures
related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean-up costs. There is
also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several
liability on all potentially responsible parties.

We cannot be sure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new
regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to us.
Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating
restrictions, particularly if those costs incurred by APS are not fully recoverable from APS’
customers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.



Concern over climate change could result in significant legislative and regulatory efforts to
limit greenhouse gas emissions or related litigation, which may increase APS’ cost of operations.

Concern over climate change, deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit
CO


, which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel, and other greenhouse
gas emissions. In addition, lawsuits have been filed against companies that emit greenhouse
gases, including a lawsuit filed against us and several other utilities, seeking damages related
to climate change. In the past several years, the United States Congress has considered bills that
would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions, but such bills have not received sufficient
Congressional approval to date to become law; however, there is growing consensus that some form of
regulation or legislation is likely to occur in the near future at the federal level with respect
to greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, in 2007, the United States Supreme Court ruled that
greenhouse gases fit within the Clean Air Act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and, as a
result, the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under
the Clean Air Act. If the United States Congress, or individual states or groups of states in
which we operate, ultimately pass legislation regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases, any
resulting limitations on generation facility CO


and other greenhouse gas emissions
could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in
the form of taxes, emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades and could have a material
adverse impact on all fossil fuel fired generation facilities
(particularly coal fired facilities,
which constitute approximately 28% of our generation capacity). If the EPA determines that
greenhouse gas emissions can reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, this
determination may impact other Clean Air Act Programs and could potentially result in new
regulatory requirements for our power plants, which could also result in substantial additional
costs. Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations could force APS and other
similarly-situated electric power generators to close some coal-fired facilities.

There are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities, such as
environmental, health, regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack.

Through APS, we have an ownership interest in and operate, on behalf of a group of owners,
Palo Verde, which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the United States. Palo
Verde is subject to environmental, health and financial risks such as the ability to dispose of
spent nuclear fuel; the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning; potential
liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities; the costs of securing the facilities
against possible terrorist attacks; and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems.
APS maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its
financial exposure to some of these risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed the
amount of insurance coverage.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related
requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of noncompliance,
the NRC has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased
inspection regime, which could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit, or both, depending
upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. See the first
risk factor above for a discussion of the enhanced NRC inspection regime currently in effect at
Palo Verde and the related operational and regulatory implications. In addition, although we have
no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at Palo Verde, if an incident did occur, it
could materially and



adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A major incident at a
nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or
licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.

The operation of Palo Verde requires licenses that need to be periodically renewed and/or
extended. In December 2008, we applied for renewed operating licenses for all three Palo Verde
units for 20 years beyond the expirations of the current licenses. We do not anticipate any
problems renewing these licenses. However, as a result of potential terrorist threats and
increased public scrutiny of utilities, the licensing process could result in increased licensing
or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to predict.

The operation of power generation facilities involves risks that could result in unscheduled
power outages or reduced output, which could materially affect our results of operations.

The operation of power generation facilities involves certain risks, including the risk of
breakdown or failure of equipment, fuel interruption, and performance below expected levels of
output or efficiency. Unscheduled outages, including extensions of scheduled outages due to
mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our
business. If APS’ facilities operate below expectations, we may lose revenue or incur additional
expenses, including increased purchased power expenses.

The ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on Indian lands
could result in uncertainty related to continued easements and rights-of-way, which could have a
significant impact on our business.

Certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants
are located on Indian lands pursuant to easements or other rights-of-way that are effective for
specified periods. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of discussions with the
appropriate Indian tribes with respect to future renewal of these easements and rights-of-way.

Deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition,
which could have a significant adverse impact on our business and our results of operations.

In 1999, the ACC approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in
Arizona. Retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on APS due to an
impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of
capital. Although some very limited retail competition existed in APS’ service area in 1999 and
2000, there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility
services to APS’ customers. As a result, we cannot predict when, and the extent to which,
additional competitors will re-enter APS’ service territory.

As a result of changes in federal law and regulatory policy, competition in the wholesale
electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater participation by traditional electricity
suppliers, non-utility generators, independent power producers, and wholesale power marketers and
brokers. This increased competition could affect APS’ load forecasts, plans for power supply and
wholesale energy sales and related revenues. As a result of the changing regulatory environment
and



the relatively low barriers to entry, we expect wholesale competition to increase, which could
adversely affect our business.

Changes in technology may adversely affect our business.

Research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce
power, including fuel cells, micro turbines, clean coal and coal gasification, photovoltaic (solar)
cells and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient gas
turbines. Advances in these, or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production,
making APS’ generating facilities less competitive. In addition, advances in technology could
reduce the demand for power supply, which could adversely affect APS’ business.

Our results of operations can be adversely affected by weather conditions.

Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of
energy commodities. Electric power demand is generally a seasonal business. In Arizona, demand
for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. As a
result, our overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition,
APS has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions
are milder. As a result, unusually mild weather could diminish our results of operations and harm
our financial condition.

Higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack, which might result in lowered soil moisture and
an increased threat of forest fires. Forest fires could threaten our communities and electric
transmission lines. Any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact our
results of operations.

Our results of operations can be adversely affected by current economic conditions.

Customer growth in APS’ service territory was 1.4% during 2008. Customer growth averaged 3% a
year for the three years 2006 through 2008. We currently expect customer growth to decline,
averaging about 1% per year for 2009 through 2011 due to factors reflecting the economic conditions
both nationally and in Arizona. We currently expect our retail sales growth in 2009 to be below
average because of potential effects on customer usage from the economic conditions mentioned above
and retail rate increases, which would adversely affect our results of operations.

The lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our
business and results of operations.

Assured supplies of water are important for APS’ generating plants. Water in the southwestern
United States is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to
access and use such limited supply of water. Both groundwater and surface water in areas important
to APS’ generating plants have been the subject of inquiries, claims and legal proceedings. In
addition, the Four Corners region, in which Four Corners is located, has been experiencing drought
conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in
the watershed that supplies the area. Our inability to access sufficient supplies of water could
have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

Our cash flow largely depends on the performance of our subsidiaries.



We conduct our operations primarily through subsidiaries. Substantially all of our
consolidated assets are held by such subsidiaries. Accordingly, our cash flow is dependent upon
the earnings and cash flows of these subsidiaries and their distributions to us. The subsidiaries
are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to make distributions to us.

The debt agreements of some of our subsidiaries may restrict their ability to pay dividends,
make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us. An ACC financing order requires APS to
maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40% and does not allow APS to pay common dividends if
the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold. The common equity ratio, as
defined in the ACC order, is common equity divided by the sum of common equity and long-term debt,
including current maturities of long-term debt.

Our ability to meet our debt service obligations could be adversely affected because our debt
securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of our
subsidiaries.

Because we are structured as a holding company, all existing and future debt and other
liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt
securities. None of the indentures under which we or our subsidiaries may issue debt securities
limits our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the future. The
assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available, in the first instance, to service
their own debt and other obligations. Our ability to have the benefit of their assets and cash
flows, particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries,
would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their
creditors have been satisfied.

Our inability to reduce capital expenditures could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operation.

Unexpected developments that may prevent us from reducing capital expenditures and other costs
while maintaining reliability and customer service levels could have a material adverse impact on
our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.

Financial market disruptions may increase our financing costs or limit our access to the
credit markets, which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial
strategy.

We rely on access to short-term money markets, longer-term capital markets and the bank
markets as a significant source of liquidity and for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash
flow from our operations. We believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial
markets. However, certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely
affect our ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include:

•

continuation of the current economic downturn;

•

the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company;

•

increased market prices for electricity and gas;

•

terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of unrelated
energy companies;



•

changes in technology;

•

mergers among financial institutions and the overall health of the banking industry;
or

•

the overall health of the utility or real estate industry.

In addition, the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be
satisfied for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress, which could
materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources.

Changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates, which would increase our
interest expense on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our current plans. Additionally,
an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by:

•

increasing the cost of future debt financing;

•

increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to
payments on our debt, which would reduce funds available to us for operations, future
business opportunities or other purposes; and

•

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have
less debt.

Recent sub-prime mortgage issues, the collapse of the credit markets, the weak housing market
and the overall weakening of the economy have adversely affected the financial markets, generally
resulting in increased interest rates for corporate debt, reduced access to the capital markets,
and actual or potential downgrades of bond insurers and banks, among other negative matters. In
general, the Company and APS have been unable to access the commercial paper markets since
September 2008. As a result, existing bank lines have been used as a source of liquidity on which
we depend. In addition, the interest rates on certain issues of APS’ pollution control bonds that
are periodically reset through auction processes have recently increased. These bonds are
supported by bond insurance policies provided by Ambac Assurance Corporation (“Ambac”), and the
interest rates on those bonds are directly affected by the rating of the bond insurer. We do not
expect, however, that any such increase will have a material adverse impact on our financial
position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.

The 2007 and 2008 financial results of SunCor, our real estate subsidiary, reflect the weak
real estate market and current economic conditions. SunCor’s principal loan facility is secured primarily by an interest in land, commercial properties,
 land contracts and homes under construction (the “Secured Revolver”).  At December 31, 2008,
SunCor had borrowings of approximately $120 million under this facility.  The Secured Revolver
matures on January 30, 2010.  In addition to the Secured Revolver, at December 31, 2008,
SunCor had approximately $68 million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities that
mature at various dates and also contain certain loan covenants.  The majority of this
indebtedness is due in 2009, and SunCor is in the process of renegotiating these facilities.

If SunCor is unable to  meet its financial covenants under the Secured Revolver or its other
outstanding credit facilities, SunCor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding
indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of cross-default provisions.  Such a debt
acceleration would have a material adverse impact on SunCor’s business and its financial
position.  The Company has not guaranteed any SunCor indebtedness.  As a result, the Company
does not believe that SunCor’s inability to meet its financial covenants under the Secured
Revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on
Pinnacle West’s cash flows or liquidity, although any resulting SunCor losses would be reflected
in Pinnacle West’s consolidated financial statements.



A reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period
of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its
judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely
affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s and APS’ securities, limit our access to capital and
increase our borrowing costs, which would diminish our financial results. We would be required to
pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding
sources could decrease. In addition, borrowing costs under certain of our existing credit
facilities depend on our credit ratings. A downgrade would also require us to provide substantial
additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various
counterparties. If our short-term ratings were to be lowered, it could completely eliminate any
possible future access to the commercial paper market. We note that the ratings from rating
agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be
evaluated independently of any other rating.

The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial
losses that negatively impact our results of operations.

Our operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices and, subject to
specified risk parameters, engaging in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from
market price movements. We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and
transportation costs of electricity, natural gas and coal, to the extent that
unhedged positions exist. We have established procedures to manage risks associated with these
market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives, including exchange-traded futures
and options and over-the-counter forwards, options, and swaps. As part of our overall risk
management program, we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of
electricity and fuels. The changes in market value of such
contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity. To the extent that
commodity markets are illiquid, we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies, which
could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time.

We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties. We
use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties.
Despite the fact that the majority of trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the
rating agencies, there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default,
which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period.

Changing interest rates and market conditions could result in financial losses that negatively
impact our results of operations.

Changing interest rates affect interest paid on variable-rate debt and interest earned on
variable-rate securities in our pension plan, other postretirement benefit plan and nuclear
decommissioning trust funds. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a
combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. The pension plan and other postretirement
benefit liabilities are also impacted by the discount rate, which is the interest rate used to
discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Declining interest rates
impact the discount rate, and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit
costs, cash contributions, regulatory assets, and charges to other comprehensive income. The
pension plan, other postretirement benefit and



nuclear decommissioning trust funds also have risks associated with changing market values of
fixed income and equity investments. A significant portion of the pension costs and other
postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in
regulated electricity prices.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response
to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:

In addition, the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been
unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations
may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Our stock price could be affected because a substantial number of shares of our common stock
could be available for sale in the future.

Sales in the public market of a substantial number of shares of common stock could depress the
market price of the common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of
additional equity securities. Because of the number of shares of our common stock that we are
authorized to issue under our articles of incorporation, a substantial number of shares of our
common stock could be available for future sale.



We may enter into credit and other agreements from time to time that restrict our ability to
pay dividends.

Payment of dividends on our common stock may be restricted by credit and other agreements
entered into by us from time to time. There are currently no material restrictions on our ability
to pay dividends under any such agreement.

Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of Arizona law make it
difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover
attempts.

These provisions, which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control
premium, include the following:

In addition, we have adopted a shareholder rights plan that may have the effect of
discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals, including takeover proposals that could result in a
premium over the market price of our common stock. The shareholder rights plan will expire on
March 26, 2009.

While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us
to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable the Board to hinder or



frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of our shareholders might believe to be in
their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace
incumbent directors.

SunCor’s business and financial performance could continue to be adversely affected by a
variety of factors affecting the real estate market.

SunCor’s business and financial performance could continue to be adversely affected by a
variety of factors affecting the real estate market, including:

As noted above (see the Risk Factor relating to “financial market disruptions”), at
December 31, 2008, SunCor had borrowings of approximately $120 million under its principal
loan facility, the Secured Revolver.  The Secured Revolver matures on January 30, 2010.  In
addition to the Secured Revolver, at December 31, 2008, SunCor had approximately $68
million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities that mature at various dates and also
contain certain loan covenants.  The majority of this indebtedness is due in 2009, and SunCor
is in the process of renegotiating these facilities.

If SunCor is unable to  meet its financial covenants under the Secured Revolver or its other
outstanding credit facilities, SunCor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding
indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of cross-default provisions.  Such a debt
acceleration would have a material adverse impact on SunCor’s business and its financial
position.  The Company has not guaranteed any SunCor indebtedness.  As a result, the Company
does not believe that SunCor’s inability to meet its financial covenants under the Secured
Revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on
Pinnacle West’s cash flows or liquidity, although any resulting SunCor losses would be reflected
in Pinnacle West’s consolidated financial statements.

During 2008 the real estate market weakened significantly resulting in lower land and home
sales and depressed real estate prices. As a result, in 2008 we recognized certain impairment
charges. If conditions in the  broader economy or the real estate markets
worsen, or as a result of a change in SunCor’s strategy, we may
be required to record additional impairements.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Pinnacle West’s Consolidated
Financial Statements and APS’ Financial Statements and the related Notes that appear in Item 8 of
this report.

OVERVIEW

Pinnacle West owns all of the outstanding common stock of APS. APS is a vertically-integrated
electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of
Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson
metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona. APS has historically accounted for a
substantial part of our revenues and earnings, and is expected to continue to do so.

While customer growth in APS’ service territory has been an important driver of our revenues
and earnings, it has significantly slowed, reflecting recessionary economic conditions both
nationally and in Arizona. Customer growth averaged 3% a year for the three years 2006 through
2008. We currently expect customer growth and retail electricity sales growth (excluding the
effects of weather variations) to average about 1% per year during 2009 through 2011. We currently
project that our customer growth will begin to accelerate as the economy recovers.

The near-term economic conditions are reflected in the recent volatility and disruption of the
credit markets, as discussed in detail under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Pinnacle West
Consolidated” below. Despite these conditions, Pinnacle West and APS currently have ample
borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and have been able to access these
facilities, ensuring adequate liquidity for each company.

Our cash flows and profitability are affected by the electricity rates APS may charge and the
timely recovery of costs through those rates. APS’ retail rates are regulated by the ACC and its
wholesale electric rates (primarily for transmission) are regulated by the FERC. APS’ capital
expenditure requirements, which are discussed below under “Liquidity and Capital Resources –
Pinnacle West Consolidated,” are substantial because of increased costs related to environmental
compliance and controls and system reliability, as well as continuing, though slowed, customer
growth in APS’ service territory.

APS needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain
adequate financial health. See “Factors Affecting Our Financial Outlook” below. On March 24,
2008, APS filed a rate case with the ACC, which it updated on June 2, 2008, requesting, among other
things, an increase in retail rates to help defray rising infrastructure costs, approval of an
impact fee and approval of new conservation rates. See Note 3 for details regarding this rate
case, including the ACC’s approval of an interim base rate surcharge pending the outcome of the
case.

The 2007 and 2008 financial results of SunCor, our real estate subsidiary, reflect the weak
real estate market and current economic conditions, which have adversely affected SunCor’s ability
to access capital. SunCor’s net loss in 2008 included a $53 million (pre-tax) real estate
impairment charge. If conditions in the broader economy or the real
estate markets worsen, or as a result of a change in SunCor’s
strategy, we may be required to record additional impairments (see
Note 23).
 In addition to SunCor’s Secured Revolver, under which approximately $120 million in borrowings were
outstanding at December 31, 2008, SunCor had approximately $68 million of outstanding debt under
other credit facilities that mature at various dates and also contain certain loan covenants. The
majority of this indebtedness, except for the Secured Revolver, is due in 2009, and SunCor is in the process of renegotiating these
facilities. If SunCor is unable to meet its financial covenants under the Secured Revolver or its other outstanding credit
facilities, SunCor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of
its credit facilities as a result of cross-default provisions. Such a debt acceleration would have
a material adverse impact on SunCor’s business and its financial position. The Company has not
guaranteed any SunCor indebtedness. As a result, the Company does not believe that SunCor’s
inability to meet its financial covenants under the Secured Revolver or its other outstanding
credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on Pinnacle West’s cash flows or liquidity,
although any resulting SunCor losses would be reflected in Pinnacle West’s consolidated financial
statements.



Our other principal first tier subsidiaries, El Dorado and APSES, are not expected to have any
material impact on our financial results, or to require any material amounts of capital, over the
next three years.

We continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and
delivery activities. In the delivery area, we focus on superior reliability and customer
satisfaction. We plan to expand long-term energy resources and our transmission and distribution
systems to meet the electricity needs of our growing retail customer base and to sustain
reliability.

See “Factors Affecting Our Financial Outlook” below for a discussion of several factors that
could affect our future financial results.

PINNACLE WEST CONSOLIDATED –

EARNINGS CONTRIBUTION BY BUSINESS SEGMENT

Pinnacle West’s two reportable business segments are:

•

our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail
and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electric service to Native Load
customers) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission and
distribution; and

•

our real estate segment, which consists of SunCor’s real estate development and
investment activities.

The following table presents income from continuing operations for our regulated electricity
and real estate segments and reconciles those amounts to net income in total for the years ended
2008, 2007, and 2006 (dollars in millions):

SunCor’s net loss in 2008 included a $32 million after-tax real estate

Includes activities related to marketing and trading, APSES, Silverhawk and El
Dorado. Income from discontinued operations for 2008 is primarily related to the
resolution of certain tax issues associated with the sale of Silverhawk in 2005. The
2007 loss is primarily related to an APSES project. None of these segments is a
reportable segment.

(c)

Primarily relates to sales of commercial properties.

PINNACLE WEST CONSOLIDATED – RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2008 Compared with 2007

Our consolidated net income decreased approximately $65 million, to $242 million in 2008 from
$307 million in 2007. The major factors that increased (decreased) our net income for the year
ended December 31, 2008 compared with the prior year are summarized in the following table (dollars

2008 Compared with 2007

The increase of approximately $156 million in net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily due to lower current income taxes; lower real estate investments resulting from the weak
real estate market; and increased retail revenue related to higher Base Fuel Rates, partially
offset by increased collateral and margin cash provided as a result of changes in commodity prices.

The decrease of approximately $58 million in net cash used for investing activities is
primarily due to a real estate commercial property sale in 2008; lower levels of capital
expenditures (see table and discussion below); and increased contributions in aid of construction
related to changes in 2008 in APS’ line extension policy (see Note 3), partially offset by lower
cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases of investment securities.

The decrease of approximately $134 million in net cash provided by financing activities is
primarily due to the use of the proceeds from the sale of a real estate commercial property to pay
down long-term debt in 2008, partially offset by higher levels of short-term debt borrowings.

2007 Compared with 2006

The increase of approximately $264 million in net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily due to a decrease in 2007 in the amount of cash collateral and margin cash returned to
counterparties as a result of changes in commodity prices.

The increase of approximately $304 million in net cash used for investing activities is
primarily due to the proceeds of $208 million received in 2006 from the 2005 sale of Silverhawk and
an increase in cash used for capital expenditures and capitalized interest (see table and
discussion below), partially offset by higher cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases of
investments.

The increase of approximately $77 million in net cash provided by financing activities is
primarily due to higher levels of short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in net new
long-term debt (issuances net of redemptions and refinancing).

(a)

Generation includes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately $60 million to
$80 million per year for 2009, 2010 and 2011.

(b)

Primarily information systems and facilities projects.

(c)

Consists primarily of capital expenditures for residential, land development
and retail and office building construction reflected in “Real estate investments” and
“Capital expenditures” on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions
and upgrades, capital replacements, new customer construction and related information systems and
facility costs. Examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines,
substations, line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to
customer information systems, partially offset by contributions in aid of construction in
accordance with APS’ line extension policy.

Generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to APS’ existing fossil
and nuclear plants. Examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions,
upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines, boilers and
environmental equipment. Environmental expenditures differ for each of the years 2009, 2010 and
2011, with the lowest year estimated at approximately $25 million, and the highest year estimated
at approximately $80 million. We are also monitoring the status of certain environmental matters,
which, depending on their final outcome, could require modification to our environmental
expenditures. (See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company
– Environmental Matters – EPA
Environmental Regulation – Regional Haze Rules” and
“Environmental Matters – EPA Environmental
Regulation – Mercury” in Item 1.)

In early 2008, we announced and began implementing a cost reduction effort that included the
elimination of approximately $200 million of capital
expenditures for the years 2008 – 2012. These
capital expenditure reductions are reflected in the estimates provided above. Due primarily to our
reduced customer growth outlook as well as the deferral of upgrades and other capital projects, we
have identified additional capital expenditure reductions of over $500 million at APS (net of the



change in
amounts collected for projected line extensions) over the years 2009 – 2011. These
reductions are across all areas – distribution, generation, transmission and general plant, and
are reflected in the estimates provided above. (See “Pinnacle
West Consolidated – Factors
Affecting Our Financial Outlook – Customer and Sales Growth” below for additional information on
our growth outlook.)

Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and/or external financings,
which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock.

Pinnacle West (Parent Company)

Our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest
payments on our long-term debt. The level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth
will be dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, payout ratio trends, free
cash flow and financial market conditions.

On January 21, 2009, the Pinnacle West Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of
$0.525 per share of common stock, payable on March 2, 2009, to shareholders of record on February
2, 2009.

Our primary sources of cash are dividends from APS, external debt and equity financings and
cash distributions from our other subsidiaries, primarily SunCor. For the years 2006 through 2008,
total distributions from APS were $510 million and total distributions received from SunCor were
$15 million. For 2008, cash distributions from APS were $170 million and there were no
distributions from SunCor. An existing ACC order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of
at least 40% and prohibits APS from paying common stock dividends if the payment would reduce its
common equity below that threshold. As defined in the ACC order, the common equity ratio is common
equity divided by the sum of common equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of
long-term debt. At December 31, 2008, APS’ common equity ratio, as defined, was approximately 54%.

The credit and liquidity markets experienced significant stress beginning the week of
September 15, 2008. While Pinnacle West’s and APS’ ability to issue commercial paper has been
negatively impacted by the market stress, they have both been able to access existing credit
facilities, ensuring adequate liquidity. Cash on hand is being invested in money market funds
consisting of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and repurchase agreements
collateralized fully by U.S. Treasury and government agency securities.

At December 31, 2008, Pinnacle West’s outstanding long-term debt, including current
maturities, was $175 million. Pinnacle West has a $300 million revolving credit facility that
terminates in December 2010. Credit commitments totaling approximately $17 million from Lehman
Brothers are no longer available due to its September 2008 bankruptcy filing. The remaining $283
million revolver is available to support the issuance of up to $250 million in commercial paper
(see discussion above) or to be used as bank borrowings, including issuances of letters of credit
of up to $94 million. At December 31, 2008, Pinnacle West had outstanding $144 million of
borrowings under its revolving credit facility and approximately $7 million of letters of credit.
Pinnacle West had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008. In general, the Company
and APS have been unable to access the commercial paper markets since September 2008. At December
31, 2008, Pinnacle West had remaining capacity available



under its revolver of approximately $132 million and had cash and investments of approximately
$6 million.

Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a
non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and
our subsidiaries. IRS regulations require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan.
We contribute at least the minimum amount required under IRS regulations, but no more than the
maximum tax-deductible amount. The minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of
plan assets and our pension obligation. The assets in the plan are comprised of fixed-income,
equity and short-term investments. Future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset
performance and plan actuarial assumptions. We contributed $35 million to our pension plan in
2008. On a cash funded basis, which is based on Internal Revenue Code regulations, our preliminary
estimate of the qualified plan’s funded status (market value of assets to liabilities) as of
January 1, 2009 is 98.6%. The plan’s IRS cash funded status was 94.3% as of January 1, 2008. Most
of the increase from the prior year was due to gains in the long-duration bonds and interest rate
swaps that we utilized in 2008 to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan’s assets
to that of the plan’s liabilities. The required minimum contribution to our pension plan is
estimated to be approximately $36 million in 2009 and approximately $25 million in 2010. The
expected contribution to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2009 is estimated to be
approximately $15 million. APS and other subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions. APS’
share is approximately 96% of both plans.

See Note 3 for information regarding Pinnacle West’s approval from the ACC regarding a
potential equity infusion into APS of up to $400 million.

In May 2007, Pinnacle West infused approximately $40 million of equity into APS, consisting of
proceeds of stock issuances in 2006 under Pinnacle West’s Investors Advantage Plan (direct stock
purchase and dividend reinvestment plan) and employee stock plans.

APS

APS’ capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and mandatory redemptions
of long-term debt. APS pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations and, to the
extent necessary, equity infusions from Pinnacle West and external financings. APS has
historically paid its dividends to Pinnacle West with cash from operations. See “Pinnacle West
(Parent Company)” above for a discussion of the common equity ratio that APS must maintain in order
to pay dividends to Pinnacle West.

APS’ outstanding long-term debt, including current maturities, was approximately $2.9 billion
at December 31, 2008. APS has two committed revolving credit
facilities totaling $900 million, of
which $400 million terminates in December 2010 and $500 million terminates in September 2011.
Credit commitments totaling about $34 million from Lehman Brothers are no longer available due to
its September 2008 bankruptcy filing. The remaining $866 million is available either to support
the issuance of up to $250 million in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings, including
issuances of letters of credit up to $583 million. At December 31, 2008, APS had borrowings of
approximately $522 million and no letters of credit under its revolving lines of credit. APS had
no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008. In general, the Company and APS have been
unable to access the commercial paper markets since September 2008. At December 31, 2008, APS had
remaining capacity available under its revolvers of $344 million and had cash and investments of
approximately $72 million.



The interest rates on eleven issues of APS’ pollution control bonds, in the aggregate amount
of approximately $343 million, are reset every seven days through auction processes. These bonds
are supported by bond insurance policies provided by Ambac, and the interest
rates on the bonds can be directly affected by the rating of the bond insurer. Certain bond
insurers, including Ambac, have had downgrades of their credit ratings. Downgrades of bond
insurers result in downgrades of the insured bonds, which increases the possibility of a “failed
auction” and results in higher interest rates during the failed auction periods. When auctions of
APS bonds fail, the APS bondholders receive the maximum 14% annual interest rate for the week of
the failed auction. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, we had ninety-nine failed
auctions, which represented about 17% of all of our auctions. The average interest rate at December 31, 2008 on the auction rate securities was 12.4%.
 Bond auctions continued to fail
through mid-January; however, since that time, we have had only one
failure. The average interest rate at February 18, 2009 on the auction rate securities was 5.7%.
 We continue to closely monitor
this market and, if market and business conditions allow, we are
planning on refunding and reissuing these bonds during 2009.
We do not expect, however, that our auction rate interest exposure will have a material adverse
impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.

On September 11, 2008, APS repurchased at par two series of pollution control bonds that had
no credit enhancements. The repurchase included $7 million of its 1996 Series A Coconino County
Pollution Control Bonds and $20 million of its 1999 Series A Coconino County Pollution Control
Bonds. APS borrowed funds under its revolving lines of credit to re-purchase the bonds as
permitted under the bond indenture. APS intends to keep the $27 million outstanding until we
complete our planned refunding and reissuance of these bonds, if market and
business conditions allow,  in 2009.

Although provisions in APS’ articles of incorporation and ACC financing orders establish
maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that APS may issue, APS does not expect any of these
provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements. On October 30, 2007, the ACC
issued a financing order in which it approved APS’ request, subject to specified parameters and
procedures, to increase (a) APS’ short-term debt authorization from 7% of APS’ capitalization to
(i) 7% of APS’ capitalization plus (ii) $500 million (which is required to be used for purchases of
natural gas and power) and (b) APS’ long-term debt authorization from approximately $3.2 billion to
$4.2 billion in light of the projected growth of APS and its customer base and the resulting
projected financing needs. This financing order expires
December 31, 2012; however, all debt previously authorized and
outstanding on December 31, 2012 will remain authorized and valid
obligations of APS.

Other
Financing Matters –

See Note 3 for information regarding the PSA approved by the ACC.
Although APS defers actual retail fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis, APS’ recovery
of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and, if necessary, periodic PSA
adjustments.

See Note S-5 for information regarding an ACC order permitting Pinnacle West to infuse up to
$400 million of equity into APS, on or before December 31, 2009, if Pinnacle West deems it
appropriate to do so to strengthen or maintain APS’ financial integrity.

See “Cash Flow Hedges” in Note 18 for information related to the change in our margin account.

Other Subsidiaries

SunCor

– The weak real estate market and current economic conditions have adversely affected
SunCor’s financial results and its ability to access capital. During the past three years,



SunCor funded its cash requirements with cash from operations and its own external financings.
SunCor’s capital needs consist primarily of capital expenditures for land development and retail
and office building construction. See the capital expenditures table above for actual capital
expenditures during 2008 and projected capital expenditures for the next three years.

SunCor’s principal loan facility, the Secured Revolver, is secured primarily by an interest in
land, commercial properties, land contracts and homes under construction. On February 19, 2009,
SunCor and the Secured Revolver lenders extended the maturity date of the Secured Revolver to
January 30, 2010 (classified as current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2008). SunCor
is required to repay amounts under the Secured Facility in order to
reduce the
lenders’ commitments to a balance of $100 million by
December 31, 2009. The Secured Revolver requires compliance with certain loan covenants pertaining to debt to net worth, debt service,
liquidity, cash flow coverage and restrictions on debt. In addition to the Secured Revolver, at
December 31, 2008, SunCor had approximately $68 million of outstanding debt under other credit
facilities that mature at various dates and also contain certain loan covenants. The majority of
this indebtedness is due in 2009, and SunCor is in the process of renegotiating these facilities.

If SunCor is unable to  meet its financial covenants under the Secured Revolver or its other outstanding credit
facilities, SunCor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of
its credit facilities as a result of cross-default provisions. Such a debt acceleration would have
a material adverse impact on SunCor’s business and its financial position. The Company has not
guaranteed any SunCor indebtedness. As a result, the Company does not believe that SunCor’s
inability to meet its financial covenants under the Secured Revolver or its other outstanding
credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on Pinnacle West’s cash flows or liquidity,
although any resulting SunCor losses would be reflected in Pinnacle West’s consolidated financial
statements.

SunCor entered into a secured construction loan on April 13, 2007, in the amount of $60
million which was subsequently repaid in June 2008.

On July 31, 2007, SunCor borrowed $12 million under a new secured construction loan. The loan
matures on July 31, 2009, and may be extended annually up to two years.

SunCor’s total outstanding debt was approximately $188 million as of December 31, 2008,
including $120 million of debt classified as current maturities of long-term debt under revolving
lines of credit totaling $150 million. SunCor’s long-term debt, including current maturities, was
$183 million and total short-term debt was $5 million at December 31, 2008. See Notes 5 and 6. SunCor
had cash and investments of approximately $27 million at December 31, 2008.

intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments.

APSES

– APSES expects minimal capital expenditures over the next three years.

Debt Provisions

Pinnacle West’s and APS’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing
arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios. Certain of APS’ bank financing arrangements
also include an interest coverage test. Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants and each
anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements. For both
Pinnacle West and APS, these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total



consolidated capitalization not exceed 65%. At December 31, 2008, the ratio was approximately 51%
for Pinnacle West and 49% for APS. The provisions regarding interest coverage require minimum cash
coverage of two times. The interest coverage was approximately 4.5 times under APS’ bank financing
agreements as of December 31, 2008. Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an
event of default which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt
subject to the covenants and could cross-default other debt. See further discussion of
“cross-default” provisions below.

Neither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’ financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would
result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating
downgrade. However, our bank financial agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest
costs we pay are determined by our current credit ratings.

All of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in
defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or
APS were to default under certain other material agreements. All of APS’ bank agreements contain
cross-default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment
under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.
Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings.

See Note 6 for further discussions.

Credit Ratings

The ratings of securities of Pinnacle West and APS as of February 18, 2009 are shown below.
The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies, from which an explanation of the
significance of their ratings may be obtained. There is no assurance that these ratings will
continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the
rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision
or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s or APS’ securities and serve
to increase the cost of and limit access to capital. It may also require substantial additional
collateral related to certain derivative instruments, natural gas transportation, fuel supply, and
other energy-related contracts.

Pinnacle West has a shelf registration under SEC Rule 415. Pinnacle West

assigned a provisional (P) rating and Standard & Poor’s assigned a preliminary (prelim)
rating to the senior unsecured securities that can be issued under such shelf
registration.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate VIE lessors in order to sell and
lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2. The leases are accounted for as operating leases in
accordance with GAAP. We are not the primary beneficiary of the Palo Verde VIEs and, accordingly,
do not consolidate them (see Note 9).

APS is exposed to losses under the Palo Verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of
certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur. Under certain
circumstances (for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde
or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to assume the debt associated
with the transactions, make specified payments to the equity participants, and take title to the
leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If
such an event had occurred as of December 31, 2008, APS would have been required to assume
approximately $174 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately $162 million.

Guarantees and Letters of Credit

We have issued parental guarantees and letters of credit and obtained surety bonds on behalf
of our subsidiaries. Our parental guarantees for Pinnacle West Marketing & Trading relate to
commodity energy products. As required by Arizona law, Pinnacle West has also obtained a $10
million bond on behalf of APS in connection with the interim base rate surcharge approved by the
ACC in December 2008. See “2008 General Rate Case — Interim Rate Surcharge” in Note 3. Our credit
support instruments enabled APSES to offer energy-related products and commodity energy.
Non-performance or non-payment under the original contract by our subsidiaries would require us to
perform under the guarantee or surety bond. No liability is currently recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets related to Pinnacle West’s current outstanding guarantees on behalf of our
subsidiaries. At December 31, 2008, we had no guarantees that were in default. Our guarantees have
no recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under the guarantees. We
generally agree to indemnification provisions related to liabilities arising from or related to
certain of our agreements, with limited exceptions depending on the particular agreement. See Note
21 for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management must often make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting
period. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ
from those estimates. We consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical
because of the uncertainties, judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and
operations involved.



Regulatory Accounting

Regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators, such as the ACC and the FERC, to
be reflected in our financial statements. Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that
would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies. If
future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in
current period earnings. A major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power
costs deferred under the PSA. APS defers for future rate recovery 90% of the difference between
actual retail fuel and power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates.
We had $795 million, including $8 million related to the PSA, of regulatory assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2008.

Also included in the balance of regulatory assets at December 31, 2008 is a regulatory asset
of $473 million in accordance with SFAS No. 158 for pension and other postretirement benefits.
This regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these
amounts are charged to earnings. If these costs are disallowed by the ACC, this regulatory asset
would be charged to OCI and result in lower future earnings.

In addition, we had $588 million of regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
at December 31, 2008, which primarily are related to removal costs. See Notes 1 and 3 for more
information.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting

Changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement
benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position.
The most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and
net periodic cost, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings
on invested funds over the long-term, and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates. We review these
assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.

The following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions
would have had on the December 31, 2008 reported pension liability on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and our 2008 reported pension expense, after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed
to electric plant participants, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income (dollars in
millions):

See Note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Derivative Accounting

Derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying
interpretations. Our evaluation of these rules, as they apply to our contracts, determines whether
we



use accrual accounting (for contracts designated as normal) or fair value (mark-to-market)
accounting. Mark-to-market accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized
periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met. For cash flow hedges, the effective
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity (as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss)).

See
“Market Risks – Commodity Price Risk” below for quantitative analysis. See “Fair Value
Measurements” below for additional information on valuation. See Note 1 for discussion on
accounting policies and Note 18 for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading
accounting.

Fair Value Measurements

We apply fair value measurements to derivative instruments, nuclear decommissioning trusts and
cash equivalents. We adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” for our financial assets and
liabilities on January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. SFAS No. 157 establishes criteria to be considered when
measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In accordance with
SFAS No. 157 we use inputs, or assumptions that market participants would use, to determine fair
market value, and the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is
classified in the fair value hierarchy. We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The determination of fair value
sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment. Our assessment of the inputs and the
significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the
instruments and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. Actual results could differ from
our estimates of fair value. See Note 14 for further fair value measurement discussion, Note 1 for
discussion on accounting policies and Note 18 for a further discussion on derivative and energy
trading accounting.

Our nuclear decommissioning trusts invest in fixed income securities and equity securities.
The fair values of these securities are based on observable inputs for identical or similar assets.
See Note 12 for further discussion of our nuclear decommissioning trusts.

Real Estate Investment Impairments

We had real estate investments of $415 million and home inventory of $51 million on our
consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2008. We assess impairment of these assets in
accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
For purposes of evaluating impairment, we classify our real estate assets, such as land under
development, land held for future development, and commercial property, as “held and used.” When
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of real estate assets
considered held and used may not be recoverable, we compare the undiscounted cash flows that we
estimate will be generated by each asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds
the undiscounted cash flows, we adjust the asset to fair value and recognize an impairment charge.
The adjusted value becomes the new book value (carrying amount) for held and used assets. We may
have real estate assets classified as held and used with fair values that are lower than their
carrying amounts, but are not deemed to be impaired because the undiscounted cash flows exceed the
carrying amounts.

Real estate home inventory is considered to be held for sale for the purposes of evaluating
impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144. Home inventories are reported at



the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value less cost to sell is
evaluated each period to determine if it has changed. Losses (and gains not to exceed any
cumulative loss previously recognized) are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount.

We determine fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows
that we estimate will be generated by each asset discounted for market risk. Our impairment
assessments and fair value determinations require significant judgment regarding key assumptions
such as future sales prices, future construction and land development costs, future sales timing,
and discount rates. The assumptions are specific to each project and may vary among projects. The
discount rates we used to determine fair values at December 31,
2008 ranged from 17% to 27%. Due
to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process, with regard to impairments, it
is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates. If conditions in the broader economy or the real estate markets
worsen, or as a result of a change in SunCor’s strategy, we may
be required to record additional impairments.

OTHER ACCOUNTING MATTERS

See Note 14 for a discussion of SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which we adopted
effective January 1, 2008, and the following related accounting guidance:

•

FASB Staff Position, No. 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”

•

FASB Staff Position, No. 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset
When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active”

See Notes 18 and S-3 for discussions of FASB Staff Position No. FIN 39-1, “Amendment of FASB
Interpretation No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts” (FIN 39-1), which we
adopted January 1, 2008.

SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” was
effective for us on January 1, 2008. This guidance provides companies with an option to report
selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. We did not elect the fair value option
for any of our financial assets or liabilities. Therefore, SFAS No. 159 did not have an impact on
our financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” This guidance requires enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and
hedging activities. The Statement is effective for us on January 1, 2009. It did not have a
material impact on our financial statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures
about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets.” This guidance requires enhanced employer disclosures
about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The guidance is
effective for us on December 31, 2009. We do not expect it to have a material impact on our
financial statements.

See Note 4 for a discussion of FIN 48 on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which was
adopted January 1, 2007.



FACTORS AFFECTING OUR FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

Factors Affecting Operating Revenues, Fuel and Purchased Power Costs

General

Electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail
markets in Arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western United
States. For the years 2006 through 2008, retail electric revenues comprised approximately 91% of
our total electric operating revenues. Our electric operating revenues are affected by electricity
sales volumes related to customer growth, variations in weather from period to period, customer
mix, average usage per customer, electricity rates and tariffs and the recovery of PSA deferrals.
Off-System Sales of excess generation output, purchased power and natural gas are included in
regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are
credited to APS’ retail customers through the PSA. These revenue transactions are affected by the
availability of excess economic generation or other energy resources and wholesale market
conditions, including demand and prices. Competitive retail sales of energy and energy-related
products and services are made by APSES in certain western states that have opened to competition.

Rate Proceedings

Our cash flows and profitability are affected by the rates APS may charge
and the timely recovery of costs through those rates. APS’ retail rates are regulated by the ACC
and its wholesale electric rates (primarily for transmission) are regulated by the FERC. APS’
capital expenditure requirements, which are discussed below under “Liquidity and Capital Resources
– Pinnacle West Consolidated,” are substantial because of environmental compliance and controls,
system reliability, and continuing, though slowed, customer growth in APS’ service territory. APS
needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain adequate
financial health. On March 24, 2008, APS filed a rate case with the ACC, which it updated on June
2, 2008, requesting, among other things, an increase in retail rates to help defray rising
infrastructure costs, approval of an impact fee and approval of new conservation rates. See Note 3
for details regarding this rate case, including the ACC’s approval of an interim base rate
surcharge pending the outcome of the case.

Fuel and Purchased Power Costs

Fuel and purchased power costs included on our Consolidated
Statements of Income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes, existing contracts for
purchased power and generation fuel, our power plant performance, transmission availability or
constraints, prevailing market prices, new generating plants being placed in service in our market
areas, our hedging program for managing such costs and, since April 1, 2005, PSA deferrals and the
amortization thereof. See Note 3 for information regarding the PSA. APS’ recovery of PSA
deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and, if necessary, periodic PSA adjustments.

Customer and Sales Growth

The customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph apply
to Native Load customers and sales to them. Customer growth in APS’ service territory was 1.4%
during 2008. Customer growth averaged 3% a year for the three years 2006 through 2008. We
currently expect customer growth to decline, averaging about 1% per year for 2009 through 2011 due
to factors reflecting the economic conditions both nationally and in Arizona. For the three years
2006 through 2008, APS’ actual retail electricity sales in kilowatt-hours grew at an average annual
rate of 2.9%; adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, such retail sales growth
averaged 2.9% a year. We currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatt-hours
will grow 1% on average per year during 2009 through 2011, excluding the effects of weather
variations. We currently expect our retail sales growth in 2009 to be below average because of
potential effects on customer usage from the economic conditions mentioned above and retail rate
increases (see Note 3).



Actual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as
a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns and
responses to retail price changes. Our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation
in our kilowatt-hour sales projection attributable to such economic factors under normal business
conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to $10 million.

Weather

In forecasting retail sales growth, we assume normal weather patterns based on
historical data. Historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net
income in excess of $20 million. However, our experience indicates that the more typical
variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to
$10 million.

Wholesale Market

Our marketing and trading activities focus primarily on managing APS’ risks
relating to fuel and purchased power costs in connection with its costs of serving Native Load
customer demand. Our marketing and trading activities include, subject to specified parameters,
marketing, hedging and trading in electricity and fuels. See “Formula Transmission Tariff” in Note
3 for information regarding APS’ recent filing with the FERC requesting a change to the formula
rate.

Other Factors Affecting Financial Results

Operations and Maintenance Expenses

Operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by
growth, power plant operations, maintenance of utility plant (including generation, transmission,
and distribution facilities), inflation, outages, higher-trending pension and other postretirement
benefit costs and other factors.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses

Depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by
net additions to utility plant and other property (such as new generation, transmission, and
distribution facilities), and changes in depreciation and amortization rates. See “Capital
Expenditures” above for information regarding planned additions to our facilities.

Property Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes, which are
affected by the value of property in-service and under construction, assessment ratios, and tax
rates. The average property tax rate for APS, which currently owns the majority of our property,
was 7.8% of the assessed value for 2008, 8.3% of the assessed value for 2007 and 8.9% of assessed
value for 2006. We expect property taxes to increase as we add new utility plant (including new
generation, transmission and distribution facilities) and as we improve our existing facilities.
See “Capital Expenditures” above for information regarding planned additions to our facilities.

Interest Expense

Interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the
interest rates on that debt. (See Note 6.) The primary factors affecting borrowing levels are
expected to be our capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities, and internally generated cash
flow. Capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under
construction. We stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial
operation.

Climate Change

Recent concern over climate change could have a significant impact on our
capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes, emissions allowances or required
equipment upgrades. The timing and type of compliance measures and related costs are impacted by
current and future regulatory and legislative actions, which we are closely monitoring. See
“Business of Arizona Public Service Company – Climate Change” in Item 1 for more information
regarding climate change initiatives.



Retail Competition

Although some very limited retail competition existed in Arizona in 1999
and 2000, there are currently no active retail electric service providers providing unbundled
energy or other utility services to APS’ customers. We cannot predict when, and the extent to
which, additional electric service providers will re-enter APS’ service territory.

Subsidiaries

SunCor’s net loss was approximately $26 million in 2008. SunCor’s net loss in
2008 included a $53 million (pre-tax) real estate impairment charge. SunCor’s net income was
approximately $24 million in 2007 and $61 million in 2006. See Note 23 for further discussion.
This estimate reflects continuation of the slowdown in the western United States real estate
markets. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Other
Subsidiaries – SunCor” and Note 6 for a
discussion of SunCor’s long-term debt, liquidity, and capital requirements.

The historical results of APSES and El Dorado are not
indicative of future performance.

General

Our financial results may be affected by a number of broad factors. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” above for further information on such factors,
which may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate.

Market Risks

Our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates, commodity
prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund.

Interest Rate and Equity Risk

We have exposure to changing interest rates. Changing interest rates will affect interest
paid on variable-rate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear
decommissioning trust fund (see Note 12). The nuclear decommissioning trust fund also has risks
associated with the changing market value of its investments. Nuclear decommissioning costs are
recovered in regulated electricity prices.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity and natural gas. Our energy risk management committee,
consisting of officers and key management personnel, oversees company-wide energy risk management
activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance with
our stated energy risk management and trading policies. We manage risks associated with these
market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives,
including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options and swaps. As
part of our risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of
electricity and fuels. The changes in market value of such
contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities.

The following tables show the net pretax changes in mark-to-market of our derivative positions
in 2008 and 2007 (dollars in millions):

Electric operating revenues were $197 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2008
compared with the prior year primarily because of:



•

a $14 million increase in renewable energy surcharges which are offset by operations
and maintenance expense;

•

a $63 million decrease in retail revenue due to the effects of weather;

•

a $47 million decrease in retail revenues related to recovery of PSA deferrals,
which had no earnings effect because of lower amortization of the same amount recorded
as fuel and purchased power expense; and

•

a $13 million net increase due to miscellaneous factors.

2007 Compared with 2006

Our net income increased approximately $14 million, to $284 million for 2007 from $270 million
for 2006. The major factors that increased (decreased) net income for the year ended December 31,
2007 compared with the prior year are contained in the following table (dollars in millions):

$


2008 Compared with 2007

The increase of approximately $19 million in net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily due to lower current income taxes and increased retail revenue related to higher Base
Fuel Rates, partially offset by increased collateral and margin cash provided as a result of
changes in commodity prices.

The decrease of approximately $2 million in net cash used for investing activities is
primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures (see table and discussion above) and
increased contributions in aid of construction related to changes in 2008 in our line extension
policy (see Note 3), substantially offset by lower cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases
of investment securities.

The increase of approximately $28 million in net cash provided by financing activities is
primarily due to higher levels of short-term borrowings, partially offset by decreased equity
infusions from Pinnacle West and the repurchase of pollution control bonds (see Note 6).

2007 Compared with 2006

The increase of approximately $372 million in net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily due to a decrease in 2007 in the amount of cash collateral and margin cash returned to
counterparties as a result of changes in commodity prices.

The increase of approximately $167 million in net cash used for investing activities is
primarily due to an increase in cash used for capital expenditures (see table and discussion above)
and



increased allowance for borrowed funds used during construction, partially offset by higher
cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases of investment securities.

The decrease of approximately $266 million in net cash provided by financing activities is
primarily due to a decrease in net new long-term debt (issuances net of redemptions and
refinancing) and a decrease in equity infusions from Pinnacle West, partially offset by higher
levels of short-term borrowings to fund day-to-day operations and liquidity needs.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

(PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION)

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), for Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework,

our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has
been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report which is included herein and also relates to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

February 19, 2009



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Pinnacle West Capital Corporation

Phoenix, Arizona

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in common stock equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
listed in the Index at Item 15. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement
schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules and an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

As reflected in the consolidated statements of changes in common stock equity, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

, effective December 31, 2006.

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation and Nature of Operations

Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Pinnacle West and
our subsidiaries: APS, SunCor, APSES, El Dorado, Pinnacle West Marketing & Trading and Pinnacle
West Energy (dissolved as of August 31, 2006). Intercompany accounts and transactions between the
consolidated companies have been eliminated.

APS is a vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale
electric service to substantially all of the state of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about
one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave County in
northwestern Arizona. SunCor is a developer of residential, commercial and industrial real estate
projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho and Utah. APSES provides energy-related projects and
competitive commodity energy to commercial and industrial retail customers in competitive markets
in the western United States. Recently, APSES has discontinued its commodity-related energy
services (see Note 22). El Dorado is an investment firm. Pinnacle West Marketing & Trading began
operations in early 2007. These operations were previously conducted by a division of Pinnacle
West through the end of 2006. By the end of 2008, substantially all the contracts were transferred
to APS or expired.

Accounting Records and Use of Estimates

Our accounting records are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Derivative Accounting

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity and natural gas. We manage risks associated with these
market fluctuations by utilizing various instruments that qualify as derivatives, including
exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options and swaps. As part of
our overall risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of
electricity and fuels. The changes in market value of such
contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged transactions.

We account for our derivative contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. SFAS No. 133 requires that entities recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at
fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are either recognized periodically
in income or, if certain hedge criteria are met, in common stock equity (as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss)). To the extent the amounts that would otherwise be
recognized in income are eligible to be recovered through the PSA, the amounts will be
recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability and have no effect on earnings. SFAS No. 133
provides a scope



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

exception for contracts that meet the normal purchases and sales criteria
specified in the standard. Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative are accounted
for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted
commodities are delivered or received.

Under fair value (mark-to-market) accounting, derivative contracts for the purchase or sale of
energy commodities are reflected at fair market value, net of valuation adjustments, as current or
long-term assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

We determine fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No.
157 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in
an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date. Inputs to fair
value include observable and unobservable data. We maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

We determine fair market value using actively-quoted prices for identical instruments when
available. When actively quoted prices are not available for the identical instruments we use
prices for similar instruments or other corroborative market information or prices provided by
other external sources. Quarterly and calendar year quotes from independent brokers are converted
into monthly prices using historical relationships. We consider broker quotes observable inputs
when the quote is binding on the broker, we can validate the quote with market transactions, or we
can determine that the inputs the broker used to arrive at the quoted price are observable.

For options, long-term contracts and other contracts for which price quotes are not available,
we use unobservable inputs, such as models and other valuation methods, to determine fair market
value. The valuation models we employ utilize spot prices, forward prices, historical market data
and other factors to forecast future prices. The primary valuation technique we use to calculate
the fair value of contracts where price quotes are not available is based on the extrapolation of
forward pricing curves using observable market data for more liquid delivery points in the same
region and actual transactions at the more illiquid delivery points. We also value option
contracts using a variation of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

For non-exchange traded contracts, we calculate fair market value based on the average of the
bid and offer price, discounted to reflect net present value. We maintain certain valuation
adjustments for a number of risks associated with the valuation of future commitments. These
include valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risks based on the financial condition of
counterparties. The liquidity valuation adjustment represents the cost that would be incurred if
all unmatched positions were closed-out or hedged.

The credit valuation adjustment represents estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to
counterparties, taking into account netting arrangements, expected default experience for the
credit rating of the counterparties and the overall diversification of the portfolio.
Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of major energy companies, municipalities, local distribution
companies and financial institutions. We maintain credit policies that management believes
minimize overall credit risk. Determination of the credit quality of counterparties is based upon
a number of factors, including credit ratings, financial condition, project economics and
collateral requirements. When



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

applicable, we employ standardized agreements that allow for the
netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.

The use of models and other valuation methods to determine fair market value often requires
subjective and complex judgment. Actual results could differ from the results estimated through
application of these methods. Our marketing and trading portfolio includes structured activities
hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales
transactions. Our practice is to hedge within timeframes established by the ERMC.

See Note 14 for additional information about fair value measurements. See Note 18 for
additional information about our derivative and energy trading accounting policies.

Regulatory Accounting

APS is regulated by the ACC and the FERC. The accompanying financial statements reflect the
rate-making policies of these commissions. For regulated operations, we prepare our financial
statements in accordance with SFAS No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation.” SFAS No. 71 requires a cost-based, rate-regulated enterprise to reflect the impact of
regulatory decisions in its financial statements. As a result, we capitalize certain costs that
would be included as expense in the current period by unregulated companies. Regulatory assets
represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in
customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already
been collected from customers.

Management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery
by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to
other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction. This determination reflects the current
political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future. If future
recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current
period earnings.

A component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power costs deferred under the
PSA. APS defers for future rate recovery or refund 90% of the difference between actual retail
fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates,
subject to specified parameters. (See Note 3).

Also included in the balance of regulatory assets at December 31, 2008 is a regulatory asset
for pension and other postretirement benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 158. This regulatory
asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are
charged to earnings. If these costs are disallowed by the ACC, this regulatory asset would be
charged to OCI and result in lower future earnings.

The detail of regulatory assets is as follows (dollars in millions):

Utility Plant and Depreciation

Utility plant is the term we use to describe the business property and equipment that supports
electric service, consisting primarily of generation, transmission and distribution facilities. We
report utility plant at its original cost, which includes:

•

material and labor;

•

contractor costs;

•

capitalized leases;



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

•

construction overhead costs (where applicable); and

•

capitalized interest or an allowance for funds used during construction.

We expense the costs of plant outages, major maintenance and routine maintenance as incurred.
We charge retired utility plant to accumulated depreciation. Liabilities associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets are recognized at fair value as incurred and capitalized
as part of the related tangible long-lived assets. Accretion of the liability due to the passage
of time is an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
long-lived asset. See Note 12.

APS records a regulatory liability for the asset retirement obligations related to its
regulated assets. This regulatory liability represents the difference between the amount that has
been recovered in regulated rates and the amount calculated under SFAS No. 143 “Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations,” as interpreted by FIN 47. APS believes it can recover in regulated
rates the costs calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 143.

We record depreciation on utility plant on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful
life of the related assets. The approximate remaining average useful lives of our utility property
at December 31, 2008 were as follows:

For the years 2006 through 2008, the depreciation rates ranged from a low of 1.11% to a high
of 12.46%. The weighted-average rate was 3.08% for 2008, 3.11% for 2007 and 3.14 % for 2006. We
depreciate non-utility property and equipment over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets, ranging from 3 to 34 years.

Investments

El Dorado accounts for its investments using either the equity method (if significant
influence) or the cost method (if less than 20% ownership).

Our investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” See Note 12 for
more information on these investments.

Capitalized Interest

Capitalized interest represents the cost of debt funds used to finance non-regulated
construction projects. The rate used to calculate capitalized interest was a composite rate of
5.2% for 2008, 5.8% for 2007 and 6.8% for 2006. Capitalized interest ceases when construction is
complete.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

AFUDC represents the approximate net composite interest cost of borrowed funds and an allowed
return on the equity funds used for construction of regulated utility plant. APS’ allowance for
borrowed funds is included in capitalized interest on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Plant
construction costs, including AFUDC, are recovered in authorized rates through depreciation when
completed projects are placed into commercial operation.

AFUDC was calculated by using a composite rate of 7.0% for 2008, 8.2% for 2007 and 8.0% for
2006. APS compounds AFUDC monthly and ceases to accrue AFUDC when construction work is completed
and the property is placed in service.

Electric Revenues

We derive electric revenues from sales of electricity to our regulated Native Load customers
and sales to other parties from our marketing and trading activities. Revenues related to the sale
of electricity are generally recorded when service is rendered or electricity is delivered to
customers. The billing of electricity sales to individual Native Load customers is based on the
reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. Unbilled
revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue/kWh to the number of estimated kWhs delivered
but not billed. Differences historically between the actual and estimated unbilled revenues are
immaterial. We exclude sales taxes and franchise fees on electric revenues from both revenue and
taxes other than income taxes.

Revenues from our Native Load customers and non-derivative instruments are reported on a gross
basis on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income. In the electricity business, some
contracts to purchase energy are netted against other contracts to sell energy. This is called a
“book-out” and usually occurs for contracts that have the same terms (quantities and delivery
points) and for which power does not flow. We net these book-outs, which reduces both revenues and
purchased power and fuel costs.

All gains and losses (realized and unrealized) on energy trading contracts that qualify as
derivatives are included in marketing and trading revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income
on a net basis.

Real Estate Revenues

SunCor recognizes revenue from land, home and qualifying commercial operating assets sales in
full, provided (a) the income is determinable, that is, the collectibility of the sales price is
reasonably assured or the amount that will not be collectible can be estimated, and (b) the
earnings process is virtually complete, that is, SunCor is not obligated to perform significant
activities after the sale to earn the income. Unless both conditions exist, recognition of all or
part of the income is postponed under the percentage of completion method per SFAS No. 66,
“Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.” SunCor recognizes income only after the asset title has
passed. Commercial property and management revenues are recorded over the term of the lease or
period in which services are provided. In addition, see Note 22 – Discontinued Operations.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Real Estate Investments

Real estate investments primarily include SunCor’s land, home inventory, commercial property
and investments in joint ventures. Land includes acquisition costs, infrastructure costs,
capitalized interest and property taxes directly associated with the acquisition and development of
each project. Home inventory consists of construction costs, improved lot costs, capitalized
interest and property taxes on homes and condos under construction. Homes under construction are
classified as “real estate investments” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; upon completion of
construction they are transferred to “home inventory” with the expectation that they will be sold
in a timely manner.

For the purposes of evaluating impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we classify our real estate
assets, including land under development, land held for future development, and commercial property
as “held and used.” When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of
real estate assets considered held and used may not be recoverable, we compare the undiscounted
cash flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset to its carrying amount. If the
carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, we adjust the asset to fair value and
recognize an impairment charge. The adjusted value becomes the new book value (carrying amount)
for held and used assets.

Real estate home inventory is considered to be held for sale for purposes of evaluating
impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144. Home inventories are reported at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Fair value less costs to sell is
evaluated each period to determine if it has changed. Losses (and gains not to exceed any
cumulative loss previously recognized) are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount.

Investments in joint ventures for which SunCor does not have a controlling financial interest
are not consolidated, but are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. In addition,
see Note 22 – Discontinued Operations and Note 23 – Real Estate Impairment Charge.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at
acquisition to be cash equivalents.

Nuclear Fuel

APS amortizes nuclear fuel by using the unit-of-production method. The unit-of-production
method is based on actual physical usage. APS divides the cost of the fuel by the estimated number
of thermal units it expects to produce with that fuel. APS then multiplies that rate by the number
of thermal units produced within the current period. This calculation determines the current
period nuclear fuel expense.

APS also charges nuclear fuel expense for the interim storage and permanent disposal of spent
nuclear fuel. The DOE is responsible for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and charges
APS $0.001 per kWh of nuclear generation. See Note 11 for information on spent nuclear fuel
disposal and Note 12 for information on nuclear decommissioning costs.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability approach prescribed by SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes” and FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – An
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” We file our federal income tax return on a consolidated
basis and we file our state income tax returns on a consolidated or unitary basis. In accordance
with our intercompany tax sharing agreement, federal and state income taxes are allocated to each
first-tier subsidiary as though each first-tier subsidiary filed a separate income tax return. Any
difference between that method and the consolidated (and unitary) income tax liability is
attributed to the parent company. The income tax liability accounts reflect the tax and interest
associated with management’s estimate of the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%
likely of being realized upon settlement for all known and measurable tax exposures. See Note 4.

Intangible Assets

We have no goodwill recorded and have separately disclosed other intangible assets, primarily
APS’ software, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” The intangible assets are amortized over their finite
useful lives. Amortization expense was $33 million in 2008, $37 million in 2007 and $39 million in
2006. Estimated amortization expense on existing intangible assets over the next five years is $29
million in 2009, $27 million in 2010, $21 million in 2011, $18 million in 2012 and $13 million in
2013. At December 31, 2008, the weighted average remaining amortization period for intangible
assets was 8 years.

2. New Accounting Standards

See Note 14 for a discussion of SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which we adopted
effective January 1, 2008, and the following related accounting guidance:

•

FASB Staff Position, No. 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”

•

FASB Staff Position, No. 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset
When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active”

See Notes 18 and S-3 for discussions of FASB Staff Position No. FIN 39-1, “Amendment of FASB
Interpretation No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts” (FIN 39-1), which we
adopted January 1, 2008.

SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” was
effective for us on January 1, 2008. This guidance provides companies with an option to report
selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. We did not elect the fair value option
for any of our financial assets or liabilities. Therefore, SFAS No. 159 did not have an impact on
our financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” This guidance requires enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and
hedging activities. The Statement is effective for us on January 1, 2009. It did not have a
material impact on our financial statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures
about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets.” This guidance requires enhanced employer’s disclosures
about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The guidance



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

is effective for us on December 31, 2009. We do not expect it to have a material impact on our
financial statements.

See Note 4 for a discussion of FIN 48 on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which was
adopted January 1, 2007.

3. Regulatory Matters

2008 General Rate Case

APS Request

– On June 2, 2008, APS filed with the ACC updated financial statements, testimony
and other data in the general rate case originally filed on March 24, 2008. As requested by the
ACC staff, the updated information reflects a test year ended December 31, 2007, rather than the
September 30, 2007 test year used in APS’ original filing. As a result of the updated filing, APS
is requesting a net retail rate increase of $278.2 million effective no later than October 1, 2009,
which represents a base rate increase of $448.2 million less the reclassification of $170 million
of fuel and purchased power revenues from the existing PSA to base rates. As proposed by APS, the
updated request would result in an average rate increase of 8.5% for existing customers plus the
establishment of a new growth-related impact fee to be charged to new connections.

The key financial provisions of the updated request include:

•

an increase of $264.3 million in non-fuel base rates and a net increase of $13.9
million for fuel and purchased power costs reflected in base rates, and recovery of up
to $53 million of such increases through the impact fee;

•

a rate base of $5.4 billion, which approximates the ACC-jurisdictional portion of
the book value of utility assets, net of accumulated depreciation and other credits, as
of December 31, 2007, which includes certain adjustments, such as the inclusion of
Units 5 and 6 of the Yucca Power Plant (near Yuma in southwestern Arizona), the steam
generator replacement at Palo Verde Unit 3, environmental upgrades to APS coal plants,
and other plant additions under construction at the end of the test year that are
currently in service or expected to go into service before the proposed rates are
requested to become effective;

•

the following proposed capital structure and costs of capital:

•

a Base Fuel Rate of $0.0388 per kWh based on estimated 2010 prices (compared to the
current Base Fuel Rate of $0.0325 per kWh);

•

an attrition adjustment of $79.3 million to address erosion in APS’ earnings and
return on equity through 2010; and

•

a new super-peak residential time-of-use rate and a commercial and industrial
critical peak pricing proposal to allow eligible customers additional options to manage
their electric bills, as well as other conservation-related rate design proposals.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The update also requests that the ACC adopt certain goals for APS to improve its financial
strength, which include: allowing APS’ internal cash flow generation to cover its operating and
capital costs of providing service; stabilizing and improving APS’ credit ratings; and providing a
meaningful and ongoing opportunity for APS to achieve a reasonable return on the fair value of its
property.

In addition, APS requested various modifications to the Environmental Improvement Surcharge
and the Demand Side Management Adjustment Clause that would allow APS to expand its conservation
and demand-side management programs and support environmental upgrades to APS facilities in
response to and in anticipation of future environmental requirements.

Interim Rate Surcharge

– On December 18, 2008, the ACC approved an emergency interim base
rate surcharge for APS. This surcharge became effective for retail customer bills issued after
December 31, 2008 and will continue in effect until a decision in the general rate case becomes
effective. This surcharge is expected to increase annual pretax retail revenues approximately
$65.2 million, and is subject to refund with interest pending the final outcome of APS’ general
retail rate case. In June 2008, APS had requested an interim increase of approximately $115
million in annual pretax retail revenues.

The decision requires that APS (a) examine its operations and expenses, targeting additional
cuts of at least $20 million, report the results of its study to the ACC no later than March 18,
2009, and reinvest the savings and surcharge revenues “in infrastructure and technology necessary
to serve APS customers and reduce the need for external debt financing”; (b) file with the ACC
periodic reports of communications with credit ratings agencies; and (c) post a $10 million bond or
letter of credit until the ACC issues a final order in APS’ general retail rate case.

ACC Staff Rate Case Recommendation

–  On December 19, 2008, the ACC staff and other
intervenors filed their initial written testimony with the ACC in the general retail rate case. In
its filed testimony, the ACC staff recommends a number of cost disallowances and test-year
adjustments that decrease APS’ base rate request by $141.6 million. The principal components of the
revenue increase recommended by the ACC staff are $155.1 million for non-fuel increases and $11.4
million for fuel and purchased power costs reflected in base rates (net of the reclassification of
$140.1 million of existing PSA revenues to base rates).

In its recommendations, the ACC staff also proposed, among other things:



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

•

That APS should propose in its rebuttal testimony a means to provide customers with
greater rate stability, such as the use of a three-year interval between base rate
filings.

The ACC staff also recommended that the ACC reject the following APS proposals:

•

The $79.3 million attrition adjustment; and

•

Modifications to APS’ line extension policy that would have resulted in the
establishment of the growth-related impact fee referenced above.

Other Intervenors’ Recommendations

– Other intervenors in the rate case include the Arizona
Residential Utility Consumer Office (“RUCO”), an office established by the Arizona legislature to
represent the interests of residential utility consumers before the ACC; and Arizonans for Electric
Choice and Competition (“AECC”), a coalition that advocates on behalf of commercial and
industrial utility customers. These other intervenors’ testimony includes the following
recommendations:

•

RUCO recommends no net rate change after reclassification of $170.0 million of PSA
revenues to base rates, based on a rate base of $4.9 billion, a base fuel rate of
$0.0388 per kWh, APS’ proposed capital structure, and a return on common equity of
9.6%.

•

AECC recommends that APS’ request be reduced by $101.4 million (of which $42.5
million was a reduction in fuel and purchased power expense).

Settlement Discussions and Procedural Schedule

– On January 30, 2009, APS began settlement
discussions with the parties to the general rate case. An ACC ALJ has issued a procedural order
staying the procedural schedule in the rate case for thirty days to allow the parties to
participate in settlement discussions. While it is in effect, the stay vacates previously
established dates for testimony filings and the discovery process. Additional stays may be
requested by the parties, depending on the settlement discussions. Hearings in the rate case were
previously scheduled to begin on April 2, 2009.

2007 Retail Rate Order

In June 2007, the ACC issued an order in a general retail rate case that APS filed in late
2005. The order approved a $322 million increase in APS’ annual retail base revenues, effective
July 1, 2007, which included a $315 million fuel-related increase and a $7 million non-fuel related
increase. The order also authorized APS’ recovery of approximately $34 million of 2005 PSA
deferrals through a temporary PSA surcharge over a twelve-month period beginning July 1, 2007,
disallowed approximately $14 million in 2007 of 2005 PSA deferrals because it found the Palo Verde
outage costs giving rise to those amounts resulted from APS’ imprudence, modified the PSA in
various respects and increased the Base Fuel Rate. In addition, the order provided that the 2007
PSA adjustor, which took effect on February 1, 2007 and that was scheduled to expire on January 31,
2008, remain in effect as long as necessary to allow APS to collect $46 million of PSA deferrals
resulting from the mid-2007 implementation of the new Base Fuel Rate. The 2007 PSA adjustor
expired as of the last billing cycle in July 2008.

PSA Mechanism

The PSA, which the ACC initially approved in 2005 as a part of APS’ 2003 rate case, and which
was modified by the ACC in 2007, provides for the adjustment of retail rates to reflect variations
in retail fuel and purchased power costs. The PSA is subject to specified parameters and
procedures, including the following:

PSA Balance

The PSA annual adjustor rate is reset for a “PSA Year” effective for a twelve-month period
beginning February 1 each year. The PSA rate for the PSA Year that began February 1, 2008 was set
at $0.004 per kWh. The PSA rate for the PSA year that began February 1, 2009 was set at $0.0053
per kWh. The PSA rate may not be increased more than $0.004 per kWh in a year without permission
of the ACC. Any uncollected deferrals during the 2009 PSA Year resulting from this limit will be
included in the historical component of the PSA rate for the PSA Year beginning February 1, 2010.

Formula Transmission Tariff

In July 2008, the FERC approved an Open Access Transmission Tariff for APS to move from fixed
rates to a formula rate-setting methodology in order to more accurately reflect the costs that APS
incurs in providing transmission services. The formula rate is updated each year effective June 1
on the basis of APS’ actual cost of service, as disclosed in APS’ FERC Form 1 report for the
previous fiscal year, and projected capital expenditures. A large portion of the rate represents
charges for transmission services to serve APS’ retail customers (“Retail Transmission Charges”).
In order to recover the Retail Transmission Charges, APS must file an application with the ACC
under the transmission cost adjustor (“TCA”) mechanism, by which changes in Retail Transmission
Charges can be reflected in APS’ retail rates.

In 2008, APS was authorized to implement increases in its annual transmission revenues based
on calculations filed with the FERC using data for its 2006 and 2007 fiscal years. Increases in
APS’ annual transmission revenues of $28 million became effective March 1, 2008 and $15 million
became effective June 1, 2008. The ACC allowed APS to reflect the related increased Retail
Transmission Charges in its retail rates through the TCA resulting in increases of annual retail
revenues of $27 million effective March 1, 2008 and $13 million effective July 3, 2008.

Equity Infusion Approval

On May 2, 2008, Pinnacle West filed a notice with the ACC that would allow Pinnacle West to
infuse up to $400 million of equity into APS in the event Pinnacle West deems it appropriate to do
so to strengthen or maintain APS’ financial integrity. Under Arizona law and implementing
regulatory decisions, Pinnacle West is required to give such notice at least 120 days prior to an
equity infusion into APS that exceeds $150 million in a single calendar year. On August 6, 2008,
the ACC issued an order permitting the infusion to occur on or before December 31, 2009.

On November 8, 2005, the ACC approved Pinnacle West’s request to infuse more than $450 million
of equity into APS during 2005 or 2006. These infusions consisted of about $250 million of the
proceeds of Pinnacle West’s common equity issuance on May 2, 2005 and about $210 million of the
proceeds from the sale of Silverhawk in January 2006. In May 2007, Pinnacle West infused



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

approximately $40 million of equity into APS, consisting of proceeds of stock issuances in 2006
under Pinnacle West’s Investors Advantage Plan (direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment
plan) and employee stock plans.

Federal

FERC Order

On August 11, 2004, Pinnacle West, APS, Pinnacle West Energy, and APSES (collectively, the
“Pinnacle West Companies”) submitted to the FERC an update to their three-year market-based rate
review pursuant to the FERC’s order implementing a new generation market power analysis. On
December 20, 2004, the FERC issued an order approving the Pinnacle West Companies’ market-based
rates for control areas other than those of APS, Public Service Company of New Mexico (“PNM”) and
Tucson Electric Power Company (“TEP”). The FERC staff required the Pinnacle West Companies to
submit additional data with respect to these control areas, and the Pinnacle West Companies did so.

On April 17, 2006, the FERC issued an order revoking the Pinnacle West Companies’ authority to
make sales at market-based rates in the APS control area (the “April 17 Order”). The FERC found
that the Pinnacle West Companies failed to provide the necessary information about the calculation
of transmission imports into the APS control area to allow the FERC to make a determination
regarding FERC’s generation market power “screens” in the APS control area. The FERC found that
the Pinnacle West Companies may charge market-based rates in the PNM and TEP control areas.

On August 13, 2007, the FERC issued an order on rehearing, reinstating the authority of the
Pinnacle West Companies to make sales at market-based rates in all seasons for sales outside of the
Phoenix Valley, and in all seasons except the summer for sales within the Phoenix Valley. The
Pinnacle West Companies submitted a compliance filing implementing this order to the FERC on
October 12, 2007. This compliance filing was accepted conditionally by the FERC in an order issued
January 17, 2008. In compliance with the January 17, 2008 order, the Pinnacle West Companies filed
a revised mitigation plan to implement cost-based rates for sales in the Phoenix Valley during the
summer months. On May 30, 2008, the FERC issued a letter order accepting our mitigation plan. The
first summer period under this cost-based mitigation began on June 1, 2008. This proceeding is now
concluded.

4. Income Taxes

Certain assets and liabilities are reported differently for income tax purposes than they are
for financial statements purposes. The tax effect of these differences is recorded as deferred
taxes. We calculate deferred taxes using the current income tax rates.

APS has recorded a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability related to income taxes on its
Balance Sheets in accordance with SFAS No. 71. The regulatory asset is for certain temporary
differences, primarily the allowance for equity funds used during construction. The regulatory
liability relates to deferred taxes resulting primarily from pension and other postretirement
benefits. APS amortizes these amounts as the differences reverse.

As a result of a change in IRS guidance, we claimed a tax deduction related to an APS tax
accounting method change on our 2001 federal consolidated income tax return. The accelerated
deduction resulted in a $200 million reduction in the current income tax liability and a
corresponding increase in the plant-related deferred tax liability. Our 2001 federal consolidated
income tax return was the subject of an IRS review and the IRS finalized its examination in the
second quarter of 2008,



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

which included a settlement on the tax accounting method change and
favorable resolution of other various tax matters. As a result of this settlement and the lapse of
federal statutes prior to 2005, we recognized net income tax benefits of approximately $30 million,
including approximately $23 million related to interest.

We
adopted FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109,” on January 1, 2007. The effect of applying the new guidance was not
significantly different in terms of tax impacts from the application of our previous policy.
Accordingly, the impact to retained earnings upon adoption was immaterial. In addition, the
guidance required us to reclassify certain tax benefits, which had the effect of increasing accrued
taxes and deferred debits by approximately $50 million to better reflect the expected timing of the
payment of taxes and interest. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of
unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at the beginning and end of the period
that are included in accrued taxes and other deferred credits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
(dollars in thousands):

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were
approximately $16 million and $5 million, respectively, of tax positions that, if recognized, would
decrease our effective tax rate.

We reflect interest and penalties, if any, on unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated
statement of income as income tax expense. The amount of interest recognized in the consolidated
statement of income related to unrecognized tax benefits was a pre-tax benefit of $51 million for
2008 and pre-tax expense of $3 million for 2007.

The total amount of accrued liabilities for interest recognized in the consolidated balance
sheets related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $6 million and $57
million, respectively. To the extent that matters are settled favorably, this amount could reverse
and decrease our effective tax rate. Additionally, as of December 31, 2008, we have recognized $1
million of interest expense to be paid on the underpayment of income taxes for certain adjustments
that we have filed, or will file, with the IRS.

The tax year ended December 31, 2005 and all subsequent tax years remain subject to
examination by the IRS. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state income tax
examinations by tax authorities for years before 1999. We do not anticipate that there will be any
significant increases or decreases in our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

5. Lines of Credit and Short-Term Borrowings

Pinnacle West had a committed line of credit with various banks totaling $300 million at
December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 due to terminate in December 2010. Credit commitments
totaling approximately $17 million from Lehman Brothers are no longer available due to its
September 2008 bankruptcy filing. The remaining $283 million revolver is available to support the
issuance of up to $250 million in commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings, including
issuances of letters of credit of up to $94 million. At December 31, 2008 Pinnacle West had $144
million of borrowings under its revolving credit facility and approximately $7 million of letters
of credit. Pinnacle West had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008. In general,
the Company and APS have been unable to access the commercial paper markets since September 2008.
Pinnacle West had remaining capacity available under its revolver of approximately $132 million and
had cash and investments of approximately $6 million. At December 31, 2007, Pinnacle West had no
borrowings under the line of credit and approximately $5 million of letters of credit and
commercial paper borrowings of $115 million. The commitment fees were 0.15 % in 2008 and 2007.
The weighted average interest rates were 2.713% at December 31, 2008 and 5.73% at December 31,
2007. All Pinnacle West and APS bank lines of credit and commercial paper agreements are
unsecured.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APS had two committed revolving credit facilities totaling $900 million at December 31, 2008
and December 31, 2007, of which $400 million terminates in December 2010 and $500 million terminates
in September 2011. Credit commitments totaling about $34 million from Lehman Brothers are no
longer available due to its September 2008 bankruptcy filing. The remaining $866 million is
available either to support the issuance of up to $250 million in commercial paper or to be used
for bank borrowings, including issuances of letters of credit of up to $583 million. At December
31, 2008, APS had borrowings of approximately $522 million and no letters of credit under its
revolving lines of credit. APS had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2008. In
general, the Company and APS have been unable to access the commercial paper markets since
September 2008. At December 31, 2008, APS had remaining capacity available under its revolvers of
$344 million and had cash and investments of approximately $72 million. At December 31, 2007, APS
had borrowings of $218 million under its $500 million line of credit and $4 million of letters of
credit issued under its $400 million line of credit. APS had no commercial paper outstanding at
December 31, 2007. The commitment fees for the $500 million line of credit were 0.10% at December
31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. The commitment fees for the $400 million line of credit were 0.11%
at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. The weighted average interest rates were 2.09% at
December 31, 2008 and 5.36% at December 31, 2007.

Although provisions in APS’ articles of incorporation and ACC financing orders establish
maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that APS may issue, APS does not expect any of these
provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements. On October 30, 2007, the ACC
issued a financing order in which it approved APS’ request, subject to specified parameters and
procedures, to increase (a) APS’ short-term debt authorization from 7% of APS’ capitalization to
(i) 7% of APS’ capitalization plus (ii) $500 million
(which is required to be used for purchases of natural gas and power) and (b) APS’ long-term debt authorization from
approximately $3.2 billion to $4.2 billion in light of the projected growth of APS and its customer
base and the resulting projected financing needs. This financing
order expires December 31, 2012; however, all debt previously
authorized and outstanding on December 31, 2012 will remain
authorized and valid obligations of APS.

SunCor had two revolving lines of credit totaling $170 million at December 31, 2008, and
December 31, 2007. The $150 million credit facility is secured and matures January 30, 2010 and the $20 million unsecured loan facility matured January 31, 2009. See Note 6 for
additional information on the secured credit facility. The unsecured loan facility includes approximately $5 million in borrowings.
SunCor is currently in the process of renegotiating this facility and, if unable to do so, will repay the amounts outstanding. At December 31, 2008 and December 31,
2007 Suncor had borrowings of $120 million and $85 million under the $150 million credit facility.
At December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 Suncor had borrowings of $5 million and $9 million under
the $20 million credit facility. The commitment fees ranged from 0.125% to 0.250% in 2008 and were
0.125% in 2007 for the $150 million line of credit. The commitment fees for the $20 million line
of credit were 0.50% in 2008 and 2007. The weighted-average interest rate was 4.11% at December
31, 2008 and 7.27% at December 31, 2007. Interest was based on LIBOR plus 2.0% for 2008 and 2007.
SunCor had other short-term borrowings of $5 million at December 31, 2008 and $8 million at
December 31, 2007. These loans are made up of multiple notes primarily with variable interest
rates based on LIBOR plus 2.5% at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

6. Long-Term Debt and Liquidity Matters

Substantially all of APS’ debt is unsecured. SunCor’s short and long-term debt is
collateralized by interests in certain real property and Pinnacle West’s debt is unsecured. The
following table presents the components of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets

The weighted-average rate was 8.3% at December 31, 2008 and 3.76% at December 31, 2007.
Changes in short-term interest rates would affect the costs associated with this debt. In
addition, these amounts include $343 million of auction rate debt securities backed by
insurance at December 31, 2008 and 2007. On September 11, 2008, APS repurchased at par two
series of pollution control bonds that had no credit enhancements. The repurchase included $7
million of its 1996 Series A Coconino County Pollution Control Bonds and $20 million of its
1999 Series A Coconino County Pollution Control Bonds. APS borrowed funds under its
revolving lines of credit to re-purchase the bonds, as permitted under the bond indenture.
APS intends to keep the $27 million outstanding until we complete our planned refunding and
reissuance of these bonds, if market and business conditions allow, in 2009.

SunCor had $125 million outstanding at December 31, 2008 under its revolving lines of credit.
The weighted-average interest rate was 4.11% at December 31, 2008. The remaining amount of

2.25% and 2.5%. SunCor had $94 million outstanding at December 31, 2007 under its revolving
lines of credit. The weighted-average interest rate was 7.27% at December 31, 2007. The
remaining amount of approximately $143 million at December 31, 2007 was made up of multiple
notes with variable interest rates based on the lenders’ prime rates plus 1.75% and 2.0% or
LIBOR plus 1.7%, 2.0% and 2.25%. There is also a note at a fixed rate of 4.25% at December
31, 2008 and 2007.

(f)

The weighted-average interest rate was 6.2% at December 31, 2008 and 7.0% at December 31,
2007.

The credit and liquidity markets experienced significant stress beginning the week of
September 15, 2008. While Pinnacle West’s and APS’ ability to issue commercial paper has been
negatively impacted by the market stress, they have both been able to access existing credit
facilities, ensuring adequate liquidity. Cash on hand is being invested in money market funds
consisting of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and repurchase agreements
collateralized fully by U.S. Treasury and government agency securities.

The interest rates on eleven issues of APS’ pollution control bonds, in the aggregate amount
of approximately $343 million, are reset every seven days through auction processes. These bonds
are supported by bond insurance policies provided by Ambac, and the interest
rates on the bonds can be directly affected by the rating of the bond insurer. Certain bond
insurers, including Ambac, have had downgrades of their credit ratings. Downgrades of bond
insurers result in downgrades of the insured bonds, which increases the possibility of a “failed
auction” and results in higher interest rates during the failed auction periods. When auctions of
APS bonds fail, the APS bondholders receive the maximum 14% annual interest rate for the week of
the failed auction. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, we had ninety-nine failed
auctions, which represented about 17% of all of our auctions. The average interest
rate at December 31, 2008 on the auction rate securities was
12.4%. Bond auctions continued to fail
through mid-January; however, since that time, we have had only one
failure.  The average interest rate at February 18, 2009 on the
auction rate securities was 5.7%. We continue to closely monitor
this market and, if market  and business conditions allow, we are
planning on refunding and reissuing these bonds during 2009.
We do not expect, however, that our auction rate interest exposure will have a material adverse
impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.

Pinnacle West’s and APS’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing
arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios. Certain of APS’ bank financing arrangements
also include an interest coverage test. Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants and each
anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements. For both
Pinnacle West and APS, these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total
consolidated capitalization cannot exceed 65%. At December 31, 2008, the ratio was approximately
51% for Pinnacle West and 49% for APS. The provisions regarding interest coverage require a
minimum cash coverage of 2 times. The interest coverage was
approximately 4.5 times under APS’ bank financing agreements as of December 31, 2008. Failure to
comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking,
would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could
cross-default other debt. See further discussion of “cross-default” provisions below.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Neither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’ financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would
result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating
downgrade. However, our bank financing agreements contain a pricing grid in which interest costs
we pay are determined by our current credit ratings.

All of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in
defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or
APS were to default under certain other material agreements. All of APS’ bank agreements contain
cross-default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment
under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.
Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings.

An existing ACC order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40%. As
defined in the ACC order, the common equity ratio is common equity divided by the sum of common
equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt. At December 31, 2008,
APS’ common equity ratio, as defined, was 54%. Its total common equity was approximately $3.3
billion, and total capitalization was approximately $6.2 billion. APS would be prohibited from
paying dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below approximately $2.5 billion,
assuming APS’ total capitalization remains the same.

SunCor’s
principal loan facility, the Secured Revolver, is secured primarily
by an interest in land, commercial properties, land contracts and
homes under construction. The Secured Revolver matures on January 30,
2010 (classified as current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2008).  SunCor is required to repay amounts under the Secured Facility
in order to reduce the lenders’ commitments. The Secured Revolver requires compliance with certain loan covenants pertaining to debt to net worth, debt service, liquidity, cash flow coverage and restrictions on debt.  In addition to the Secured Revolver, at December 31, 2008, SunCor had approximately $68 million in borrowings under other credit facilities that mature at various dates and also contain certain loan covenants.  The majority of this
 indebtedness is due in 2009, and SunCor is in the process of renegotiating these facilities.

If SunCor is unable to  meet its financial covenants under the Secured Revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities, SunCor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of cross-default provisions.  Such a debt acceleration would have a material adverse
impact on SunCor’s business and its financial position.  The Company has not guaranteed any SunCor indebtedness.  As a result, the Company does not believe that SunCor’s inability to meet its financial covenants under the Secured Revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on Pinnacle West’s cash flows or liquidity, although any resulting SunCor losses would be reflected in Pinnacle West’s consolidated financial statements.

As of December 31, 2008, the amount of SunCor’s net assets that could not be transferred to
Pinnacle West in the form of cash dividends as a result of the covenants mentioned above was
approximately $224 million out of a total of approximately $263 million. As a result of the
restrictions under the ACC order referenced above and contained in the SunCor loan facilities, as
of December 31, 2008, the restricted net assets of our subsidiaries exceeded 25% of our
consolidated net assets (at December 31, 2008, our consolidated net assets were approximately $3.4
billion). These restrictions do not materially affect Pinnacle West’s ability to meet its ongoing
capital requirements.

8. Retirement Plans and Other Benefits

Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a
non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and
its subsidiaries. All new employees participate in the account balance plan. Defined benefit
plans specify the amount of benefits a plan participant is to receive using information about the
participant. The pension plan covers nearly all employees. The supplemental excess benefit
retirement plan covers officers of the Company and highly compensated employees designated for
participation by the Board of Directors. Our employees do not contribute to the plans. Generally,
we calculate the benefits based on age, years of service and pay.

We also sponsor other postretirement benefits for the employees of Pinnacle West and our
subsidiaries. We provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees. Employees must
retire to become eligible for these retirement benefits, which are based on years of service and
age. For the medical insurance plans, retirees make contributions to cover a portion of the plan
costs. For the life insurance plan, retirees do not make contributions. We retain the right to
change or eliminate these benefits.

Pinnacle West uses a December 31 measurement date each year for its pension and other
postretirement benefit plans. The market-related value of our plan assets is their fair value at
the measurement date. The fair market value of investments in our retirement and postretirement
plans is determined using actively-quoted prices when available. When actively-quoted prices are
not available, we use prices provided by external sources, models or other valuation methods. The
use of models and other valuation methods to determine fair market value often requires subjective
and complex judgment. Actual results could differ from the results estimated through the
application of these methods.

A significant portion of the changes in the actuarial gains and losses of our pension and
postretirement plans is attributable to APS and therefore is recoverable in rates. Accordingly,
these changes are recorded as a regulatory asset.

The following table provides details of the plans’ net periodic benefit costs and the portion
of these costs charged to expense (including administrative costs and excluding amounts capitalized
as overhead construction or billed to electric plant participants) (dollars in thousands):

2009, we are assuming a 8.25% long-term rate of return on plan assets, which we believe is
reasonable given our asset allocation in relation to historical and expected performance.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the

The Board of Directors has delegated oversight of the plans’ assets to an Investment
Management Committee, which has adopted an investment policy. The investment policy sets forth the
objective of providing for future pension benefits by maximizing return consistent with acceptable
levels of risk. The primary investment strategies are diversification of assets, stated asset
allocation targets and ranges, prohibition of investments in Pinnacle West securities, and external
management of plan assets.

During 2008, Pinnacle West began utilizing long-duration bonds and interest-rate swaps to
better match the interest-rate sensitivity of the plans’ assets to that of the plans’ liabilities.
The actual return on plan assets for the year ending December 31, 2008, included the impact of
unrealized gains related to our pension plan of approximately $495 million and unrealized gains
related to our postretirement plan of approximately $65 million due to the strong performance of
the U.S. Treasury bond market. In late 2008 and early 2009, we closed out the swap contracts and
reinvested the proceeds into long-term bonds.

Contributions

The required minimum contribution to our pension plan is estimated to be approximately $36
million in 2009 and approximately $25 million in 2010. The contribution to our other
postretirement benefit plans in 2009 is estimated to be approximately $15 million. APS and other
subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions. APS’ share is approximately 96% of both plans.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

Benefit payments, which reflect estimated future employee service, for the next five years and

West and its subsidiaries. In 2008, costs related to APS’ employees represented 96% of the total
cost of this plan. In a defined contribution savings plan, the benefits a participant receives
result from regular contributions participants make to their own individual account, the Company’s
matching contributions and earnings or losses on their investments. Under this plan, the Company
matches a percentage of the participants’ contributions in cash which is then invested in the same
investment mix as participants elect to invest their own future contributions. At December 31,
2008, approximately 14% of total plan assets were in Pinnacle West stock. Pinnacle West recorded
expenses for this plan of approximately $8 million for 2008, $7 million for 2007 and $6 million for
2006. APS recorded expenses for this plan of approximately $8 million in 2008, $6 million in 2007
and $6 million in 2006.

9. Leases

In 1986, APS sold about 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain common facilities in
three separate sale leaseback transactions. APS accounts for these leases as operating leases.
The gain resulting from the transaction of approximately $140 million was deferred and is being
amortized to operations and maintenance expense over 29.5 years, the original term of the leases.
There are options to renew the leases or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end
of the lease terms. We are analyzing this matter, and will continue to do so as we approach the
end of the lease terms, to determine which option or options to pursue. Rent expense is calculated
on a straight-line basis. See Note 20 for a discussion of VIEs, including the VIE’s involved in
the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions.

In addition, we lease certain land, buildings, equipment, vehicles and miscellaneous other
items through operating rental agreements with varying terms, provisions and expiration dates.

Total lease expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $74 million in
2008, $73 million in 2007 and $72 million in 2006. APS’ lease expense was $67 million in 2008, $66
million in 2007 and $64 million in 2006.

The amounts to be paid for the Palo Verde Unit 2 leases are approximately $49 million per year
for the years 2009 to 2016.

Estimated future minimum lease payments for Pinnacle West’s and APS’ operating leases,
excluding purchase power agreements, are approximately as follows (dollars in millions):

10. Jointly-Owned Facilities

APS shares ownership of some of its generating and transmission facilities with other
companies. Our share of operations and maintenance expense and utility plant costs related to
these facilities is accounted for using proportional consolidation. The following table shows APS’

11. Commitments and Contingencies

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station

Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal

Nuclear power plant operators are required to enter into spent fuel disposal contracts with
the DOE, and the DOE is required to accept and dispose of all spent nuclear fuel and other
high-level radioactive wastes generated by domestic power reactors. Although the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act required the DOE to develop a permanent repository for the storage and disposal of spent
nuclear fuel by 1998, the DOE has announced that the repository cannot be completed before at least
2017. In November 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
(D.C. Circuit) issued a decision preventing the DOE from excusing its own delay, but refused to
order the DOE to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel. Based on this decision and the DOE’s delay, a
number of utilities, including APS (on behalf of itself and the other Palo Verde owners), filed
damages actions against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. APS is currently pursuing that
damages claim. In August 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued
decisions in three damages actions brought by other nuclear utilities that could result in a
decrease in the amount of our recoverable damages; however, additional appeals in those actions are
possible and APS continues to monitor the status of those actions. The trial in the APS matter
began on January 28, 2009. Testimony and evidence have been presented by both sides. The trial
court has set a post-trial briefing schedule and is expected to hear closing arguments in the early
summer of 2009.

APS currently estimates it will incur $132 million (in 2008 dollars) over the life of Palo
Verde for its share of the costs related to the on-site interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. At
December 31, 2008, APS had a regulatory liability of $22 million that represents amounts recovered
in retail rates in excess of amounts spent for on-site interim spent fuel storage.

Nuclear Insurance

The Palo Verde participants have insurance for public liability resulting from nuclear energy
hazards to the full limit of liability under federal law. This potential liability is covered by
primary liability insurance provided by commercial insurance carriers in the amount of $300 million
and the balance by an industry-wide retrospective assessment program. If losses at any nuclear
power plant covered by the program exceed the accumulated funds, APS could be assessed
retrospective premium adjustments. The maximum assessment per reactor under the program for each
nuclear incident is approximately $118 million, subject to an annual limit of $18 million per
incident, to be periodically adjusted for inflation. Based on APS’ interest in the three Palo
Verde units, APS’ maximum potential assessment per incident for all three units is approximately
$103 million, with an annual payment limitation of approximately $15 million.

The Palo Verde participants maintain “all risk” (including nuclear hazards) insurance for
property damage to, and decontamination of, property at Palo Verde in the aggregate amount of $2.75
billion, a substantial portion of which must first be applied to stabilization and decontamination.
APS has also secured insurance against portions of any increased cost of
generation or purchased power and business interruption resulting from a sudden and unforeseen
accidental outage of any of the three units. The property damage, decontamination, and replacement
power coverages are provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL). APS is subject to
retrospective assessments under all NEIL policies if NEIL’s losses in any policy year exceed



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

accumulated funds. The maximum amount of retrospective assessments APS could incur under the
current NEIL policies totals approximately $21 million. The insurance coverage discussed in this
and the previous paragraph is subject to certain policy conditions and exclusions.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

Pinnacle West and APS are parties to various fuel and purchased power contracts with terms
expiring between 2009 and 2042 that include required purchase provisions. Pinnacle West and APS
estimate the contract requirements to be approximately $449 million in 2009; $364 million in 2010;
$287 million in 2011; $397 million in 2012; $380 million in 2013; and $6.1 billion thereafter.
However, these amounts may vary significantly pursuant to certain provisions in such contracts that
permit us to decrease required purchases under certain circumstances.

Of the various fuel and purchased power contracts mentioned above, some of those contracts
have take-or-pay provisions. The contracts APS has for its coal supply include take-or-pay
provisions. The current take-or-pay coal contracts have terms that expire in 2024.

The following table summarizes our actual and estimated take-or-pay commitments (dollars in
millions):

Total take-or-pay commitments are approximately $865 million. The total net
present value of these commitments is approximately $595 million.

Coal Mine Reclamation Obligations

APS must reimburse certain coal providers for amounts incurred for coal mine reclamation.
APS’ coal mine reclamation obligation was approximately $91 million at December 31, 2008 and
December 31, 2007 and is included in Deferred Credits and Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

California Energy Market Issues and Refunds in the Pacific Northwest

FERC

In July 2001, the FERC ordered an expedited fact-finding hearing to calculate refunds for spot
market transactions in California during a specified time frame. APS was a seller and a purchaser
in the California markets at issue and, to the extent that refunds are ordered, APS should be a
recipient as well as a payor of such amounts. In addition, on March 19, 2002, the State of
California filed a complaint with the FERC alleging that wholesale sellers of power and energy,
including APS, failed to properly file rate information at the FERC in connection with sales to
California from 2000 to March 2002 under market-based rates. Since 2004, the Ninth Circuit and the
FERC have issued various decisions and orders involving the aforementioned issues, including
decisions related to: entities subject to FERC jurisdiction and, therefore, potentially owing
refunds; applicable refund methodologies; the temporal scope and types of transactions that are
properly



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

subject to the refund orders; and the appropriate standard of review at the FERC on wholesale
power contracts in the refund proceedings. A settlement, resolving APS’ issues with certain
California parties for the current refund period, was approved by the FERC in an order issued on
June 30, 2008. The resolution of the claims related to the parties involved in this settlement had
no material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We
currently believe the refund claims at the FERC related to the parties not involved in this
settlement will have no material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

On March 26, 2003, the FERC made public a Final Report on Price Manipulation in Western
Markets, prepared by its staff and covering spot markets in the West in 2000 and 2001. The report
stated that a significant number of entities who participated in the California markets during the
2000-2001 time period, including APS, may potentially have been involved in arbitrage transactions
that allegedly violated certain provisions of the Independent System Operator tariff. After
reviewing the matter, along with the data supplied by APS, the FERC staff moved to dismiss the
claims against APS and to dismiss the proceeding. The motion to dismiss was granted by the FERC on
January 22, 2004. Certain parties sought rehearing of this order; however, under the settlement
agreement mentioned above, these parties withdrew their request for rehearing on July 22, 2008.

On July 25, 2001, the FERC also ordered an evidentiary proceeding to discuss and evaluate
possible refunds for wholesale sales in the Pacific Northwest. The FERC affirmed the ALJ’s
conclusion that the prices in the Pacific Northwest were not unreasonable or unjust and refunds
should not be ordered in this proceeding. This decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit. On August 24, 2007, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion that remanded the
proceeding to the FERC for further consideration. Petitions for rehearing of this opinion were
filed. Although the FERC has not yet determined whether any refunds will ultimately be required,
we do not expect that the resolution of these issues will have a material adverse impact on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Navajo Nation Litigation

In June 1999, the Navajo Nation served Salt River Project with a lawsuit filed in the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia (the “D.C. Lawsuit”) naming Salt River Project,
several Peabody Coal Company entities (collectively, “Peabody”), Southern California Edison Company
and other defendants, and citing various claims in connection with the renegotiations of the coal
royalty and lease agreements under which Peabody mines coal for the Navajo Generating Station and
the Mohave Generating Station. APS is a 14% owner of the Navajo Generating Station, which Salt
River Project operates. The D.C. Lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants obtained
a favorable coal royalty rate by improperly influencing the outcome of a federal administrative
process under which the royalty rate was to be adjusted. The suit seeks $600 million in damages,
treble damages, punitive damages of not less than $1 billion, and the ejection of defendants “from
all possessory interests and Navajo Tribal lands arising out of the [primary coal lease].” In July
2001, the court dismissed all claims against Salt River Project.

In January 2005, Peabody served APS with a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court for the City of
St. Louis naming APS and the other Navajo Generating Station participants and seeking, among other
things, a declaration that the participants “are obligated to reimburse Peabody for any royalty,
tax, or other obligation arising out of the D.C. Lawsuit.” Based on APS’ ownership interest in the
Navajo Generating Station, APS could be liable for up to 14% of any such obligation. On July 10,



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2008, Peabody agreed to dismiss this litigation without prejudice. APS cannot currently predict
whether the lawsuit will be refiled based upon the final outcome of the D.C. Lawsuit.

Superfund

Superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating
the soil, water or air. Those who generated, transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a
contaminated site are among those who are PRPs. PRPs may be strictly, and often are jointly and
severally, liable for clean-up. On September 3, 2003, the EPA advised APS that the EPA considers
APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52

nd

Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 (OU3) in
Phoenix, Arizona. APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site. APS and Pinnacle West
have agreed with the EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within
OU3. Because the investigation has not yet been completed and ultimate remediation requirements
are not yet finalized, at the present time neither APS nor Pinnacle West can accurately estimate
the expenditures that may be required.

Salt River Project

Salt River Project has notified APS that Salt River Project allegedly failed to bill APS for
(a) energy losses under certain service schedules of a power contract between the parties and (b)
certain other charges under the contract. Salt River Project asserts that certain of these
failures to bill APS for such losses and charges may extend back to 1996 and, as a result, claims
that APS owes it approximately $29 million. APS disputes that it is required to pay these amounts.
No lawsuit or litigation has been initiated in the matter at this time. We do not expect that
resolution of this matter will have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Litigation

We are party to various other claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary
course of business, including but not limited to environmental matters related to the Clean Air
Act, Navajo Nation issues and EPA and ADEQ issues. In our opinion, the ultimate resolution of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

12. Asset Retirement Obligations

APS has asset retirement obligations for its Palo Verde nuclear facilities and certain other
generation, transmission and distribution assets. The Palo Verde asset retirement obligation
primarily relates to final plant decommissioning. This obligation is based on the NRC’s
requirements for disposal of radiated property or plant and agreements APS reached with the ACC for
final decommissioning of the plant. The non-nuclear generation asset retirement obligations
primarily relate to requirements for removing portions of those plants at the end of the plant life
or lease term.

Some of APS’ transmission and distribution assets have asset retirement obligations because
they are subject to right of way and easement agreements that require final removal. These
agreements have a history of uninterrupted renewal that APS expects to continue. As a result,
APS cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the asset retirement obligation related to such
distribution and transmission assets.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Additionally, APS has aquifer protection permits for some of its generation sites that require
the closure of certain facilities at those sites. The generation sites are strategically located
to serve APS Native Load customers. Management expects to continuously use the sites and, thus,
cannot estimate a potential closure date. The asset retirement obligations associated with our
non-regulated assets are immaterial.

In accordance with SFAS No. 71, APS accrues removal costs for its regulated utility assets,
even if there is no legal obligation for removal. See detail of regulatory liabilities in Note 1.

To fund the costs APS expects to incur to decommission Palo Verde, APS established external
decommissioning trusts in accordance with NRC regulations. APS invests the trust funds in fixed
income securities and domestic equity securities. APS applies the provisions of SFAS No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” in accounting for investments
in decommissioning trust funds, and classifies these investments as available for sale. As a
result, we record the decommissioning trust funds at their fair value on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Because of the ability of APS to recover decommissioning costs in rates and in accordance
with the regulatory treatment for decommissioning trust funds, we have recorded the offsetting
amount of gains on investment securities in other regulatory liabilities or assets

.

14. Fair Value Measurements

We adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” on January 1, 2008. This new standard
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements.  The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a
material impact on our financial statements.

In February 2008 the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157-2 (FSP 157-2), “Effective Date of
FASB Statement No. 157,” which delayed the effective date
of SFAS No. 157 for all nonrecurring fair
value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities by one year. In accordance with FSP
157-2 we delayed the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for our nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except
those items recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, until January 1, 2009. The
adoption of SFAS No. 157 for our nonfinancial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact
on our financial statements.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of
a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active.” This guidance clarifies the
application of SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” in a market that is not active and provides
guidance on key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market
for the asset is not active. This guidance did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.

SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose the fair value of certain assets and liabilities
according to a fair value hierarchy. This hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the
inputs used to determine fair values, which are then classified and disclosed in one of three
categories. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:

Level
1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Active
markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient
frequency and volume to provide information on an ongoing basis. This category includes our derivative



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

instruments that are exchange traded such as futures, cash equivalents invested
in exchange traded money market funds, and nuclear decommissioning asset investments in
Treasury securities.

Level
2 – Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable.
Derivative instruments in this category include non-exchange traded contracts such as
forwards, options, and swaps. This category also includes our nuclear decommissioning trust
assets in bonds and commingled equity funds.

Level
3 – Model-derived valuations with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or
no market activity. Instruments in this category include long dated derivative transactions
where models are required due to the length of the transaction, options, and transactions in
locations where observable market data does not exist.

As required by SFAS No. 157, assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level
of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Our assessment of the significance of a
particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of
fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. We
assess whether a market is active by obtaining observable broker quotes, reviewing actual market
transactions, and assessing the volume of transactions.

Some of our derivative instrument transactions are valued based on unobservable inputs due to
the long-term nature of contracts or the unique location of the transactions. Our long-dated
energy transactions, consist of observable valuations for the near term portion and unobservable
valuations for the long-term portions of the transaction. When the unobservable portion is
significant to the overall valuation of the transaction, the entire transaction is classified as
Level 3. Our classification of instruments as Level 3 is primarily reflective of the long term
nature of our energy transactions, and is not reflective of material inactive markets. For further
discussion of how our derivative instruments are valued see Note 1.

The nuclear decommissioning trust invests in fixed income securities directly and equity
securities indirectly through commingled funds. Commingled funds are valued based on the fund
share price and are classified within Level 2. The commingled funds’ underlying investments would
be Level 1 if the investments were held directly by the trust. Our trustee provides valuation of
our nuclear decommissioning trust assets by using pricing services to determine fair market value.
We assess these valuations and verify pricing that can be supported by actual market transactions.
The trust fund investments have been established to satisfy APS’ nuclear decommissioning
obligations (see Note 12).

Dilutive stock options and performance shares (which are contingently issuable) increased
average common shares outstanding by approximately 274,000 shares in 2008, 579,000 shares in 2007
and 593,000 shares in 2006. Total average common shares outstanding for the purposes of
calculating diluted earnings per share were 100,964,920 shares in 2008, 100,834,871 shares in 2007
and 100,010,108 shares in 2006.

Options to purchase 687,375 shares of common stock were outstanding at December 31, 2008 but
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise
prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares. Options to purchase shares
of common stock that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share were
114,213 at December 31, 2007 and 437,401 at December 31, 2006.

16. Stock-Based Compensation

Pinnacle West offers stock-based compensation plans for officers and key employees of Pinnacle
West and our subsidiaries.

The 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2007 Plan”) allows Pinnacle West to grant incentive and
nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
performance shares, performance share units, performance cash awards, dividend equivalents and



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

stock to eligible individuals. We have reserved 8 million shares of common stock for issuance
under the 2007 Plan plus additional shares that become available for issuance under prior stock
plans (“Prior Plans”). Under the 2007 Plan, any shares of stock that are potentially deliverable
under any award granted under a Prior Plan will be added to the number of shares of stock available
for grant under the 2007 Plan if the award expires or is cancelled or terminated without a delivery
of such shares to the participant. In addition, any shares of stock that have been issued in
connection with any award granted under a Prior Plan will be added to the number of shares
available for grant under the 2007 Plan if the award is cancelled, forfeited, or terminated such
that those shares are returned to the Company. No more than 500,000 shares of stock may be granted
to any one participant during a calendar year. The maximum performance-based award (other than a
performance cash award) payable to any one participant during a performance period is 500,000
shares of stock or the cash equivalent. The plan also provides for the granting of new incentive
and non-qualified stock options at a price per share equal to at least 100% of the fair market
value of the common stock at the time of grant. The terms of the options cannot be longer than 10
years and the options cannot be repriced during their terms.

The 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2002 Plan”) relates to outstanding performance shares and
stock options but no new awards may be granted under the plan. Performance share awards under the
2002 Plan contain performance criteria that affect the number of shares that ultimately vest.

The 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“1994 Plan”) relates to outstanding options and restricted
stock but no new awards may be granted under the plan. Options vested by thirds over a three-year
period beginning one year after the date the option was granted and expire ten years from the date
of the grant. The release of the restricted stock is based on employee holdings of our common
stock.

In 2006, Retention Unit Awards (“Retention Units”) were granted to key employees. Each
Retention Unit represents the right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of one
share of Pinnacle West’s common stock, determined on pre-established valuation dates. The Company
is required to redeem one-fourth of the Retention Units on the first business day of calendar years
2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. In addition, the employee will receive a cash payment equal to the
amount of dividends that the employee would have received if the employee had owned the stock from
the date of grant to the date of payment plus interest. The Retention Units will fully vest on
January 2, 2010; for any employee that was eligible to retire before that date, the employee’s
Retention Units immediately vested and the compensation expense was immediately recognized as of
the date of retirement eligibility. As this award is accounted for as a liability award,
compensation costs, initially measured based on the Company’s stock price on the grant date, are
remeasured at each balance sheet date, using Pinnacle West’s closing stock price. The amount of
cash to settle the payment on the first business day of 2008 was $1.3 million and in 2007 was $1.6
million.

In 2008 and 2007 under the 2007 Plan, Restricted Stock Unit Awards (“Restricted Stock Units”)
were granted to officers and key employees. Each officer and key employee had to elect to receive
payment for the vested Restricted Stock Units in cash or in fully transferable shares of stock.
The fair value of the stock election is estimated on the date of the grant using the Company’s
closing stock price on the date of grant. Each Restricted Stock Unit cash election represents the
right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of one share of Pinnacle West’s
common stock, determined on pre-established valuation dates. One-fourth of the Restricted Stock
Units will be redeemed February 20th for four years following the year of the grant. In addition,
the employee will receive a cash payment equal to the amount of dividends that the employee would
have received if



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the employee had owned the Restricted Stock Unit from the date of grant to the
date of payment plus interest. Restricted Stock Units vest over a four-year period for the 2007
and the 2008 grant, unless the employee is eligible to retire, in which case the employee’s
Restricted Stock Units are immediately vested (with the same redemption dates) and the compensation
expense is immediately recognized; however, the Restricted Stock Units will be redeemed on the
pre-established redemption dates. As the Restricted Stock Unit cash election award is accounted
for as a liability award, the fair market value of the outstanding Restricted Stock Unit cash
election is re-measured at each balance sheet date, using Pinnacle West’s closing stock price. The
amount of cash required to settle the payment for the 2007 grant on February 20, 2008 was $1
million.

In 2008 under the 2007 Plan, performance shares were granted to officers and key employees.
Performance share awards under the 2007 Plan contain performance criteria that affect the number of
shares that ultimately vest. Generally, each recipient of performance shares is entitled to
receive shares of common stock shortly after the end of a three-year performance period. The number of shares
each recipient ultimately receives, if any, is based upon the percentile ranking of Pinnacle West’s
earnings per share growth rate at the end of the three-year period as compared with the earnings
per share growth rate of all relevant companies in a specified utilities index. The fair value of
the grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the Company’s closing stock price on the date
of the grant. Management evaluates the probability of meeting the performance criteria at each
balance sheet date and related compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a
straight-line basis. If the goals are not achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any
previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.

In 2008 under the 2007 Plan, restricted stock unit awards and performance shares were granted
to a selected set of key employees of Pinnacle West on October 21, 2008. This award of performance
shares follows the same vesting schedule as the performance shares awarded in 2006, 2007 and 2008.
The award of the restricted stock units follows the same vesting schedule as the 2007 and 2008
restricted stock units for the payment dates on February 20

On January 21, 2009 under the 2007 Plan, the Human Resources Committee approved payment of
2008 incentive awards to officers in the form of Pinnacle West common stock pursuant to the 2007
Plan. This incentive award is included in stock compensation expense in 2008.

The compensation cost that has been charged against Pinnacle West’s income for share-based
compensation plans was $8 million in 2008, $6 million in 2007 and $13 million in 2006. The
compensation cost that Pinnacle West has capitalized was immaterial in 2008, 2007 and 2006.
Pinnacle West’s total income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for
share-based compensation arrangements was $3 million in 2008, $2 million in 2007 and $5 million in
2006. APS’ share of compensation cost that has been charged against income was $7 million in 2008,
$6 million in 2007 and $12 million in 2006.

18. Derivative and Energy Trading Accounting

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity, natural gas, coal, and in interest rates. We manage
risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various instruments that qualify as
derivatives, including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options
and swaps. As part of our overall risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge
purchases and sales of electricity and  fuels. As of December
31, 2008, we hedged certain exposures to the price variability of commodities for a maximum of 39
months. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in
the hedged transactions.

We recognize all derivatives, except those which qualify for a scope exception, as either
assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value in
accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 149. Derivative commodity contracts for the
physical delivery of purchase and sale quantities transacted in the normal course of business
qualify for the normal purchase and sales exception and are accounted for under the accrual method
of accounting. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized periodically in
income unless certain hedge criteria are met. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of
changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity (as a component of
other comprehensive income (loss)). For fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as
well as the offsetting loss



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

or gain on the hedged item associated with the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. We use
cash flow hedges to limit our exposure to cash flow variability on forecasted transactions. We use
fair value hedges to limit our exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability.

For its regulated operations, APS defers for future rate recovery approximately 90% of gains
and losses on derivatives that would otherwise be recognized in income pursuant to the PSA
mechanism. In the following discussion, amounts that would otherwise be recognized in income will
be recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability and have no effect on earnings to the extent
these amounts are eligible to be recovered through the PSA.

We assess hedge effectiveness both at inception and on a continuing basis. Hedge
effectiveness is related to the degree to which the derivative contract and the hedged item are
correlated and is measured based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative
contract and the hedged item over time. We exclude the time value of certain options from our
assessment of hedge effectiveness. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, or
the amount by which the derivative contract and the hedged commodity are not directly correlated,
is recognized immediately in net income.

Derivatives that do not qualify for a scope exception are classified as assets and liabilities
from risk management and trading activities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain of our
non-trading derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. Non-trading derivatives,
or any portion thereof that are not effective hedges, are adjusted to fair value through income.
Realized gains and losses related to non-trading derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges of
expected transactions are recognized in revenue or purchased power and fuel expense as an offset to
the related item being hedged when the underlying hedged physical transaction impacts earnings. If
it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we discontinue the use of hedge
accounting and recognize in income the unrealized gains and losses that were previously recorded in
other comprehensive income (loss). In the event a non-trading derivative is terminated or settled,
the unrealized gains and losses remain in other comprehensive income (loss), and are recognized in
income when the underlying transaction impacts earnings.

All gains and losses (realized and unrealized) on trading contracts that qualify as
derivatives are included in marketing and trading revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income
on a net basis. Trading contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative are accounted
for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted
commodities are delivered or received.

In the electricity business, some contracts to purchase energy are netted against other
contracts to sell energy. This is called “book-out” and usually occurs in contracts that have the
same terms (quantities and delivery points) and for which power does not flow. We net these
book-outs, which reduces both revenues and fuel and purchased power costs in our Consolidated
Statement of Income, but this does not impact our financial condition, net income or cash flows.

Cash Flow Hedges

The changes in the fair value of our hedged positions included in the Consolidated Statements

reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income as an offset to the effect of market price
changes for the related hedged transactions. To the extent the amounts are eligible for inclusion
in the PSA, the amounts will be recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability and have no
effect on earnings (see Note 3).

We adopted FASB Staff Position No. FIN 39-1, “Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39,
Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts” (FIN 39-1) on January 1, 2008. In accordance
with this guidance, we elected to offset the fair value amounts for derivative instruments,
including collateral, executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. The
following table summarizes our assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities
in accordance with FIN 39-1 at December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands):

We maintain a margin account with a broker to support our risk management and trading
activities. Cash is deposited with the broker in this account at the time futures or options
contracts are initiated. The change in market value of these contracts (reflected in
mark-to-market) requires adjustment of the margin account balance.

Credit Risk

We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties. We
have risk management and trading contracts with many counterparties, including one counterparty for
which a worst case exposure represents approximately 60% of Pinnacle West’s $66 million of risk
management and trading assets as of December 31, 2008. This exposure relates to a long-term
traditional wholesale contract with a counterparty that has very high credit quality. Our risk
management process assesses and monitors the financial exposure of all counterparties. Despite the
fact that the great majority of trading counterparties’
securities are rated as investment grade by
the credit rating agencies, there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could
default, resulting in a material impact on consolidated earnings for a given period.
Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of financial institutions, major energy
companies, municipalities and local distribution companies. We maintain credit policies that we
believe minimize overall credit risk to within acceptable limits. Determination of the credit
quality of our counterparties is based upon a number of factors, including credit ratings and our
evaluation of their financial condition. To manage credit risk, we employ collateral requirements,
standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated
with a single counterparty. Valuation adjustments are established representing our estimated
credit losses on our overall exposure to counterparties. See Note 1. “Derivative Accounting,” for
a discussion of our credit valuation adjustment policy.

See Note 14 for a discussion of SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which we adopted
January 1, 2008.

20. Variable-Interest Entities

In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate VIE lessors in order to sell and
lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2. The leases are accounted for as operating leases in
accordance with GAAP. We are not the primary beneficiary of the Palo Verde VIEs and, accordingly,
do not consolidate them (see Note 9).

APS is exposed to losses under the Palo Verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of
certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur. Under certain
circumstances (for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde
or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to assume the debt associated
with the transactions, make specified payments to the equity participants, and take title to the
leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If
such an event had occurred as of December 31, 2008, APS would have been required to assume
approximately $174 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately $162 million.

SunCor has certain land development arrangements that are required to be consolidated under
FIN 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” The assets and non-controlling interests
reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these arrangements were approximately $29
million at December 31, 2008 and $38 million at December 31, 2007.

21. Guarantees

We have issued parental guarantees and letters of credit and obtained surety bonds on behalf
of some of our subsidiaries. Our parental guarantees for Pinnacle West Marketing & Trading and APS
relate to commodity energy products. As required by Arizona law, Pinnacle West has also obtained a
$10 million bond on behalf of APS in connection with the interim base rate surcharge approved by
the ACC in December 2008. See “2008 General Rate Case – Interim Rate Surcharge” in Note 3. Our
credit support instruments enable APSES to offer energy-related products and



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

commodity energy. Non-performance or non-payment under the original contract by our subsidiaries
would require us to perform under the guarantee or surety bond. No liability is currently recorded
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to Pinnacle West’s current outstanding guarantees on
behalf of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2008 we had no guarantees that were in default. Our
guarantees have no recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under the
guarantees. The amounts and approximate terms of our guarantees and surety bonds for each
subsidiary at December 31, 2008 are as follows (dollars in millions):

At December 31, 2008, Pinnacle West had approximately $7 million of letters of credit related
to workers’ compensation expiring in 2009. We intend to provide from either existing or new
facilities for the extension, renewal or substitution of the letters of credit to the extent
required.

APS has entered into various agreements that require letters of credit for financial assurance
purposes. At December 31, 2008, approximately $200 million of letters of credit were outstanding
to support existing pollution control bonds of approximately $200 million. The letters of credit
are available to fund the payment of principal and interest of such debt obligations and expire in
2010. APS has also entered into approximately $78 million of letters of credit to support certain
equity lessors in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions (see Notes 9 and 20 for further
details on the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions). These letters of credit expire in 2010.
APS intends to provide from either existing or new facilities for the extension, renewal or
substitution of the letters of credit to the extent required.

We enter into agreements that include indemnification provisions relating to liabilities
arising from or related to certain of our agreements; most significantly, APS has agreed to
indemnify the equity participants and other parties in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions
with respect to certain tax matters. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in
the indemnification provisions and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under
such indemnification provisions cannot be reasonably estimated. Based on historical experience and
evaluation of the specific indemnities, we do not believe that any material loss related to such
indemnification provisions is likely.

22. Discontinued Operations

SunCor

(real estate segment)

–

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, SunCor sold commercial properties,
which are required to be reported as discontinued operations on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated
Statements of Income in accordance with SFAS No. 144. As a result of the sales, we recorded a gain
from discontinued operations of approximately $24 million ($40 million pretax) in 2008; $10 million
($17 million pretax) in 2007; and $9 million ($15 million pretax) in 2006.

23. Real Estate Impairment Charge

During 2008, particularly late in the year, the real estate market weakened significantly
resulting from the severe liquidity shortages in the financial markets, oversupply of home
inventories, tight credit markets and downward pressure on residential and commercial property
values. The effects of these factors have resulted in elevated cancellation rates, low sales
absorption rates and overall weak consumer confidence. In recent months, the overall economy has
weakened significantly and fears of a prolonged recession are now pronounced due to rising
unemployment levels, further deterioration in consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. Also, because of terms
of renewal of SunCor’s Secured Revolver (see Note 6), during the fourth quarter of 2008, we
revised forecasts related to potential disposal of certain assets classified as home inventory
and as held and used. These factors resulted in 2008 impairment charges of $24 million related
to our home inventory, which is considered held for sale and $29 million related to our held and
used assets. The held and used assets include a project under development, an office building,
a golf course, and completed home lots in Arizona. We determine fair value for our real estate
assets primarily based on the future cash flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset
discounted for market risk. Our impairment assessments and fair value determinations require
significant judgment regarding key assumptions such as future sales prices, future construction
and land development costs, future sales timing, and discount rates. The assumptions are
specific



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

to each project and may vary among projects. The discount rates we used to determine fair
values at December 31, 2008 ranged from 17% to 27%. Due to the judgment and assumptions applied
in the estimation process, with regard to impairments, it is possible that actual results could
differ from those estimates.
If conditions in the broader economy or the real estate markets
worsen, or as a result of a change in SunCor’s strategy, we may
be required to record additional impairments.



MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

(ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY)

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), for Arizona Public
Service Company. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation
under the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework,

our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008. The effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
which is included herein and also relates to the Company’s financial statements.

February 19, 2009



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of

Arizona Public Service Company

Phoenix, Arizona

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Arizona Public Service Company (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related statements of income, changes in common stock
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. We also have
audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

As reflected in the  statements of changes in common stock equity, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,

effective December 31, 2006.

ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

S-1. Income Taxes

APS is included in Pinnacle West’s consolidated tax return. However, when Pinnacle West
allocates income taxes to APS, it is done based upon APS’ taxable income computed on a stand-alone
basis, in accordance with the tax sharing agreement.

Certain assets and liabilities are reported differently for income tax purposes than they are
for financial statements purposes. The tax effect of these differences is recorded as deferred
taxes. We calculate deferred taxes using the current income tax rates.

APS has recorded a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability related to income taxes on its
Balance Sheets in accordance with SFAS No. 71. The regulatory asset is for certain temporary
differences, primarily the allowance for equity funds used during construction. The regulatory
liability relates to deferred taxes resulting primarily from pension and other postretirement
benefits. APS amortizes these amounts as the differences reverse.

As a result of a change in IRS guidance, we claimed a tax deduction related to an APS tax
accounting method change on our 2001 federal consolidated income tax return. The accelerated
deduction resulted in a $200 million reduction in the current income tax liability and a
corresponding increase in the plant-related deferred tax liability. Our 2001 federal consolidated
income tax return was the subject of an IRS review and the IRS finalized its examination in the
second quarter of 2008, which included a settlement on the tax accounting method change and
favorable resolution of other various tax matters. As a result of this settlement and the lapse of
federal statutes prior to 2005, we recognized net income tax benefits of approximately $30 million,
including approximately $23 million related to interest.

We adopted FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109,” on January 1, 2007. The effect of applying the new guidance was not
significantly different in terms of tax impacts from the application of our previous policy.
Accordingly, the impact to retained earnings upon adoption was immaterial. In addition, the
guidance required us to reclassify certain tax benefits, which had the effect of increasing accrued
taxes and deferred debits by approximately $50 million to better reflect the expected timing of the
payment of taxes and interest. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of
unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at the beginning and end of the
period that are included in accrued taxes and other deferred credits on the Balance Sheets (dollars
in thousands):

ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were
approximately $15 million and $4 million, respectively, of tax positions that, if recognized, would
decrease our effective tax rate.

We reflect interest and penalties, if any, on unrecognized tax benefits in the statement of
income as income tax expense. The amount of interest recognized in the statement of income related
to unrecognized tax benefits was a pre-tax benefit of $51 million for 2008 and a pre-tax expense of
$3 million for 2007.

The total amount of accrued liabilities for interest recognized in the balance sheets related
to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $5 million and $56 million,
respectively. To the extent that matters are settled favorably, this amount could reverse and
decrease our effective tax rate. Additionally, as of December 31, 2008, we have recognized $1
million of interest expense to be paid on the underpayment of income taxes for certain adjustments
that we have filed, or will file, with the IRS.

The tax year ended December 31, 2005 and all subsequent tax years remain subject to
examination by the IRS. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state income tax
examinations by tax authorities for years before 1999. We do not anticipate that there will be any
significant increases or decreases in our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

S-3. Derivative and Energy Trading Accounting

APS is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity, natural gas and  coal. As part of its overall risk
management program, APS uses various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives to hedge
purchases and sales of electricity and  fuels. As of December 31,
2008, APS hedged certain exposures to these risks for a maximum of 39 months.

Cash Flow Hedges

The changes in the fair value of APS’ hedged positions included in the APS Statements of
Income, after consideration of amounts deferred under the PSA, for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):

During 2009, APS estimates that a net loss of $91 million before income taxes will be
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income as an offset to the effect of market price
changes for the related hedged transactions. To the extent the amounts are eligible for inclusion
in the PSA, the amounts will be recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability and have no
effect on earnings (see Note 3).



ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APS adopted FASB Staff Position No. FIN 39-1, “Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39,
Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts” (FIN 39-1) on January 1, 2008. In accordance
with this guidance, APS elected to offset the fair value amounts for derivative instruments,
including collateral, executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. The

On May 2, 2008, Pinnacle West filed a notice with the ACC that would allow Pinnacle West to
infuse up to $400 million of equity into APS in the event Pinnacle West deems it appropriate to do
so to strengthen or maintain APS’ financial integrity. Under Arizona law and implementing
regulatory decisions, Pinnacle West is required to give such notice at least 120 days prior to an
equity infusion into APS that exceeds $150 million in a single calendar year. On August 6, 2008,
the ACC issued an order permitting the infusion to occur on or before December 31, 2009.

On November 8, 2005, the ACC approved Pinnacle West’s request to infuse more than $450 million
of equity into APS during 2005 or 2006. These infusions consisted of about $250 million of the
proceeds of Pinnacle West’s common equity issuance on May 2, 2005 and about $210 million of the
proceeds from the sale of Silverhawk in January 2006. In May 2007, Pinnacle West infused
approximately $40 million of equity into APS, consisting of proceeds of stock issuances in 2006
under Pinnacle West’s Investors Advantage Plan (direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment
plan) and employee stock plans.

Intercompany receivables primarily include amounts related to the intercompany sales of
electricity. Intercompany payables primarily include amounts related to the intercompany purchases
of electricity. Intercompany receivables and payables are generally settled on a current basis in
cash.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS

ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term “disclosure controls and procedures” means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) (15 U.S.C.
78a

et seq

.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a
company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Pinnacle West’s management, with the participation of Pinnacle West’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of Pinnacle West’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2008. Based on that evaluation, Pinnacle West’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of that date, Pinnacle West’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

APS’ management, with the participation of APS’ Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of APS’ disclosure controls and procedures as of December
31, 2008. Based on that evaluation, APS’ Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that, as of that date, APS’ disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

(b) Management’s Annual Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Reference is made to “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
(Pinnacle West Capital Corporation)” on page 79 of this report and “Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting (Arizona Public Service
Company)” on page 142 of this report.

(c) Attestation Reports of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

Reference
is made to “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm” on page 80 of
this report and “Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm” on page 143 of this
report on the internal control over financial reporting of Pinnacle West and APS, respectively.

(d) Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The term “internal control over financial reporting” (defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(f)) refers to
the process of a company that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of



financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP.

No change in Pinnacle West’s or APS’ internal control over financial reporting occurred during
the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, Pinnacle West’s or APS’ internal control over financial reporting.

This amount includes shares subject to outstanding options as well as shares subject
to outstanding performance share awards and restricted stock unit awards at the maximum amount of
shares issuable under such awards. However, payout of the performance share awards is contingent
on the Company reaching certain levels of performance during a three-year performance period. If
the performance criteria for these awards are not fully satisfied, the award recipient will receive
less than the maximum number of shares available under these grants and may receive nothing from
these grants.


The weighted average exercise price in this column does not take performance share
awards or restricted stock unit awards into account, as those awards have no exercise price.


Awards can take the form of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance shares, performance share units, performance cash, stock grants, dividend equivalents,
and restricted stock units.

.

Equity Compensation Plans Approved By Security Holders

Amounts in column (a) in the table above include shares subject to awards outstanding under
three equity compensation plans that were approved by our shareholders: (a) the Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan, under which no new stock awards may be granted;
(b) the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”), under
which no new stock awards may be granted; and (c) the Pinnacle West Capital



Corporation 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”), which was approved by our shareholders at our 2007
annual meeting of shareholders. Although we cannot issue additional awards under the 2002 Plan,
shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2002 Plan that expire or are cancelled or terminated
will be available for issuance under the 2007 Plan. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding these plans.

Equity Compensation Plans Not Approved By Security Holders

The Company does not have any equity compensation plans under which shares can still be issued
that have not been approved by shareholders.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND
