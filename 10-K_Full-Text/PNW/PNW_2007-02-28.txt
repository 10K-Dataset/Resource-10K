PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

General

Pinnacle West was incorporated in 1985 under the laws of the State of Arizona and owns all of
the outstanding equity securities of APS, its major subsidiary. APS is a vertically-integrated
electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of
Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson
metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona.

Pinnacle West’s other significant subsidiaries are SunCor, which is engaged in real estate
development and investment activities, and APS Energy Services, which provides competitive energy
services and products in the western United States. Pinnacle West Energy, which owned and operated
unregulated generating plants, transferred the PWEC Dedicated Assets to APS on July 29, 2005 and
sold its 75% ownership interest in Silverhawk to NPC on January 10, 2006. As a result, Pinnacle
West Energy no longer owned any generating plants and was dissolved as of August 31, 2006.
 Pinnacle West’s other first-tier subsidiaries, El Dorado Investment
Company, Pinnacle West Marketing &
Trading,  SunCor and APS Energy Services, are discussed in greater detail



below. See “Business of SunCor Development Company” and “Business of Other Subsidiaries,” in this
Item 1.

Business Segments

Pinnacle West has two principal business segments (determined by products, services and the
regulatory environment):

•

the regulated electricity segment (77% of operating revenues in 2006), which
consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses
(primarily electric service to Native Load customers) and related activities, and
includes electricity generation, transmission and distribution; and

•

the real estate segment (12% of operating revenues in 2006), which consists of
SunCor’s real estate development and investment activities.

See Note 17 in Item 8 for financial information about the business segments.

APS Rate Proceedings

The key issue affecting Pinnacle West’s and APS’ financial outlook is adequate and timely
retail rate treatment by the ACC. APS’ retail rate proceedings pending before the ACC are
discussed in greater detail in Note 3 in Item 8.

Employees

At December 31, 2006, Pinnacle West employed approximately 7,400 people, including the
employees of its subsidiaries. Of these employees, approximately 6,600 were employees of APS,
including employees at jointly-owned generating facilities (approximately 3,000 employees) for
which APS serves as the generating facility manager. Approximately 800 people were employed by
Pinnacle West and its other subsidiaries. Pinnacle West’s principal executive offices are located
at 400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85004 (telephone 602-250-1000).

Forward-Looking Statements

This document contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and neither
Pinnacle West nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements or make any further
statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking
statements are often identified by words such as “estimate,” “predict,” “hope,” “may,” “believe,”
“anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “require,” “intend,” “assume” and similar words. Because actual
results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on
these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from
historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or
APS. In addition to the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this report, these factors include,
but are not limited to:



REGULATION AND COMPETITION

Retail

The ACC regulates APS’ retail electric rates and its issuance of securities. The ACC must
also approve any transfer of APS’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or
receive prior notification of certain transactions between Pinnacle West, APS and their respective
affiliates.

APS is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investor-owned utilities in
Arizona (such as Southwest Gas Corporation), as well as cooperatives, municipalities, electrical
districts and similar types of governmental or non-profit organizations. In addition, some
customers, particularly industrial and large commercial customers, may own and operate generation
facilities to meet their own energy requirements.

In 1999, the ACC approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in
Arizona. As a result, as of January 1, 2001, all of APS’ retail customers were eligible to choose
alternate energy suppliers. However, there are currently no active retail competitors offering
unbundled energy or other utility services to APS’ customers. In 2000, an Arizona Superior Court
found that the rules were unconstitutional, primarily on procedural grounds, and invalidated all
ACC orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in Arizona. In 2004, the
Arizona Court of Appeals invalidated some, but not all of the rules. In 2005, the Arizona Supreme
Court declined to review the Court of Appeals decision. To date, the ACC has taken no action on
either the rules or the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to
the final Court of Appeals decision. As a result, at present only limited electric retail
competition exists in



Arizona and only with certain entities not regulated by the ACC. APS cannot predict when, and the
extent to which, additional competitors will re-enter APS’ service territory.

Wholesale

General

The FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services. During 2006,
approximately 4.4% of APS’ electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services. APS’
marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing APS’ fuel and purchased power risks in
connection with its costs of serving retail customer energy requirements. The division also sells,
in the wholesale market, APS’ generation output that is not needed for APS’ Native Load and, in
doing so, competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers.
Additionally, the marketing and trading division, subject to specified parameters, markets, hedges
and trades principally in electricity and fuels.

BUSINESS OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

General

APS was incorporated in 1920 under the laws of the state of Arizona and currently has
approximately 1,052,000 customers. APS does not distribute any products. During 2006, no single
purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 6.1% of electric revenues. See “Overview –
General” and “Regulation and Competition” above for additional background information about APS’
business.

At December 31, 2006, APS employed approximately 6,600 people, including employees at
jointly-owned generating facilities for which APS serves as the generating facility manager. APS’
principal executive offices are located at 400 North Fifth Street, P.O. Box 53999, Phoenix, Arizona
85072-3999 (telephone 602-250-1000).

Purchased Power and Generating Fuel

See “Properties – Capacity” in Item 2 for information about APS’ power plants by fuel types.

2006 Energy Mix

APS’ sources of energy during 2006 were: purchased power – 35.0%; coal – 31.2%; gas – 17.3%;
and nuclear – 16.5%. In accordance with GAAP, a substantial
portion of APS’ purchased power
contracts was netted against wholesale sales contracts on the Statements of Income. See Note 18 in
Item 8.

Coal Supply

Cholla

Cholla is a coal-fired power plant located in northeastern Arizona. It is a
jointly-owned facility operated by APS. APS purchases most of Cholla’s coal requirements from coal
suppliers that mine all of the coal under long-term leases of coal reserves with the Navajo Nation,
the federal government and private landholders. APS may purchase a portion of Cholla’s coal
requirements on the spot market to take advantage of competitive pricing options and to supplement



coal required for increased operating capacity. APS believes that the current fuel contracts
and competitive fuel supply options ensure the continued operation of Cholla for its useful life.
In addition, APS has a long-term coal transportation contract.

Four Corners

Four Corners is a coal-fired power plant located in the northwestern corner of
New Mexico. It is a jointly-owned facility operated by APS. APS purchases all of Four Corners’
coal requirements from a supplier with a long-term lease of coal reserves with the Navajo Nation.
The Four Corners coal contract runs through July 2016, with options on APS’ part to extend the
contract for five to fifteen additional years beyond the current plant site lease expiration in
2017.

Navajo Generating Station

The Navajo Generating Station is a coal-fired power plant located
in northern Arizona. It is a jointly-owned facility operated by Salt River Project. The Navajo
Generating Station’s coal requirements are purchased from a supplier with long-term leases from the
Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. The Navajo Generating Station is under contract with its coal
supplier through 2011, with options to extend through the current plant site lease expiration in
2019. The Navajo Generating Station lease waives certain taxes through the lease expiration in
2019. Items that may impact the fuel price include lease provisions that allow for a
renegotiation of the coal royalty in 2007 and 2017 and a fuel contract requirement for a five-year
price review in 2007.

See “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 for information about a lawsuit relating to royalties for
coal paid by the participants at the Navajo Generating Station.

See “Properties – Capacity” in Item 2 for information about APS’ ownership interests in
Cholla, Four Corners and the Navajo Generating Station. See Note 11 in Item 8 for information
regarding APS’ coal mine reclamation obligations.

Natural Gas Supply

See Note 11 in Item 8 for a discussion of APS’ natural gas supply.

Nuclear Fuel Supply

Palo Verde Fuel Cycle

Palo Verde is a nuclear power plant located about 50 miles west of
Phoenix, Arizona. It is a jointly-owned facility operated by APS. The fuel cycle for Palo Verde
is comprised of the following stages:

The Palo Verde participants are continually identifying their
future resource needs and negotiating
arrangements to fill those needs. The Palo Verde participants have contracted for
all of Palo Verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates and conversion services through 2007 and
for approximately 70% of uranium concentrates and conversion services in 2008. The participants
have



also contracted for all of Palo Verde’s enrichment services through 2010, 80% of enrichment
services through 2013, and all of Palo Verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services until at least
2015.

Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal

See “Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station” in Note 11
in Item 8 for a discussion of spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal.

Purchased Power

In addition to its own available generating capacity (see “Properties” in Item 2), APS
purchases electricity under various arrangements. One of the most important of these is a
long-term contract with Salt River Project. The amount of electricity available to APS is based in
large part on customer demand within certain areas now served by APS pursuant to a related
territorial agreement. The generating capacity available to APS pursuant to the contract is 350
MW. In 2006, APS received 550,567 MWh of energy under the contract and paid about $66.1 million
for capacity availability and energy received. This contract may be canceled by Salt River Project
on three years’ notice. By letter dated June 7, 2004, Salt River Project gave notice to APS to
reduce capacity by 150 MW effective June 16, 2007. To date, this letter is the only notice Salt
River Project has given under the contract. APS may also cancel the contract on five years’
notice.

In September 1990, APS entered into a thirty-year seasonal capacity exchange agreement with
PacifiCorp. Under this agreement, APS receives electricity from PacifiCorp during the summer peak
season (from May 15 to September 15) and APS returns electricity to PacifiCorp during the winter
season (from October 15 to February 15). Until 2020, APS and PacifiCorp each has 480 MW of
capacity and a related amount of energy available to it under the agreement for its respective
seasons. In 2006, APS received 571,181 MWh of energy under the capacity exchange. APS must also
make additional offers of energy to PacifiCorp each year through October 31, 2020. Pursuant to
this requirement, during 2006, PacifiCorp received offers of 1,105,125 MWh and purchased 309,750
MWh.

APS continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system
reliability. Consistent with the terms of the 2004 Settlement Agreement, and, as a result of
seeking proposals from the competitive wholesale market, APS entered into a number of agreements
under which APS is entitled to purchase power, including several agreements (aggregating 650 MW)
running through 2015 covering APS’ peak periods. APS has also entered into an agreement under
which APS is entitled to the output of a 510 MW power plant from June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2017.
APS has also agreed to purchase approximately 100 MW of renewable power (wind, geothermal and
landfill gas) under contracts that expire between 2025 and 2029. APS remains committed to seeking
proposals from the competitive wholesale market for filling its future resource needs, including
for renewable capacity.

Construction Program

During the years 2004 through 2006, APS incurred approximately $2 billion in capital
expenditures. APS’ capital expenditures for the years 2007 through 2009 are expected to be
primarily for expanding transmission and distribution capabilities to meet growing customer needs,
for upgrading existing utility property and for environmental purposes. APS’ capital expenditures
were approximately $662 million in 2006. APS’ capital expenditures, including expenditures for
environmental control facilities, for the years 2007 through 2009, net of contributions in aid of
construction, have been estimated as follows (dollars in millions):

also included. APS conducts a continuing review of its construction program.

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –
Capital Needs and Resources” in Item 7 for additional information about APS’ construction programs.

Environmental Matters

EPA Environmental Regulation

Regional Haze Rules

On April 22, 1999, the EPA announced final regional haze rules. These
regulations require states to submit state implementation plans (SIPs) by 2008 to demonstrate
“reasonable progress” towards achieving natural visibility conditions in certain “Class I Areas,”
including several on the Colorado Plateau. The SIP is required to consider and potentially apply
“best available retrofit technology” (BART) for certain older major stationary sources.

The rules allow nine western states and tribes to follow an alternate implementation plan and
schedule for the Class I Areas. This alternate implementation plan is known as the Annex Rule.
Five western states, including Arizona, have submitted proposed SIPs to the EPA to implement the
Annex Rule.

On February 18, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a
petition for review of the Annex Rule, filed by the Center for Energy and Economic Development
(CEED). APS, Phelps Dodge Corporation, and the Environmental Defense were intervenors in the
litigation in support of the EPA and the Annex Rule. Although the Court concluded that the EPA has
the authority to promulgate a BART alternative, the Court ruled that the EPA must first conduct a
BART analysis of eligible sources to demonstrate that the alternate plan would achieve greater
emissions reductions than under an application of BART.

On June 15, 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule, which amends the 1999 regional
haze rules by providing guidelines, known as the BART guidelines, for states to use in determining
which facilities must install controls and the type of controls the facilities must use. On
October 13, 2006, the EPA issued a final rule reconciling the Annex Rule with the CEED decision.

The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) is currently undertaking a rulemaking
process to amend its SIP to reconcile with the Annex Rule litigation and SIPs to implement the
Clean Air Visibility Rule requirements. As part of the rulemaking process, the ADEQ will require
certain sources in the state to conduct BART analyses, potentially including Cholla and



other APS plants. The ADEQ’s Regional Haze SIPs are due to EPA Region 9 in December 2007. In
addition, we anticipate that EPA Region 9 may require Four Corners to conduct a BART analysis. The
Company cannot currently predict the outcome of these proceedings.

Mercury

On March 15, 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) to control
mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. This rule establishes performance standards
limiting mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants and establishes a two phased market-based
emissions trading program. Under the trading program, the EPA has assigned each state a mercury
emissions “budget” and each state must submit to the EPA a plan detailing how it will meet its
“budget.” In the first phase of the program, beginning in 2010, mercury emissions from all
coal-fired power plants in the country will be reduced from a total of 48 tons per year to 38 tons.
In 2018, those emissions will be further reduced to 15 tons. APS is currently evaluating the
potential impact of this rule and, as a result, cannot currently estimate the expenditures which
may be required.

In November 2006, the ADEQ submitted a SIP to the EPA to implement the CAMR. ADEQ’s SIP
generally incorporates the EPA’s model cap-and-trade program, but it includes additional
requirements, including the requirement to meet a 90% mercury removal control level or 0.0087
lbs/GWh, whichever is greater, the requirement to obtain mercury allowances at a 2:1 ratio for any
emissions that fall below the specified control level, and the requirement, beginning in 2013, to
consider clean coal technologies as part of permitting any new generation. APS is evaluating the
potential impacts of the proposed rule and cannot currently estimate the expenditures that may be
required.

Federal Implementation Plan

In September 1999, the EPA proposed a FIP to set air quality
standards at certain power plants, including the Navajo Generating Station and the Four Corners
Power Plant. On July 26, 2006, the Sierra Club sued the EPA in an attempt to force the EPA to
issue a final FIP to limit emissions at the Four Corners Power Plant. On September 12, 2006, the
EPA proposed a revised FIP to establish air quality standards at Four Corners and the Navajo
Generating Station. On September 18, 2006, APS filed a motion to intervene in the Sierra Club’s
lawsuit against the EPA, in order to assure that its interests are protected. On November 22,
2006, the court granted APS’ motion to intervene in the lawsuit. In December 2006, the court
issued a consent decree signed by the Sierra Club and the EPA; the consent decree requires EPA to
take “final action” on the proposed FIP by April 30, 2007. APS cannot currently predict the effect
of the proposed FIP on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity, or
whether the proposed FIP will be adopted in its current form.

In addition, on August 21, 2006, the EPA proposed a FIP to implement “minor New Source Review”
on Indian reservations. The FIP, if finalized, would apply to Four Corners and the Navajo
Generating Station, and would require preconstruction review and permitting of plant projects that
meet specified criteria. APS does not currently expect this FIP to have a material adverse effect
on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.

Superfund

Superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found
contaminating the soil, water or air. Those who generated, transported or disposed of hazardous
substances at a contaminated site are among those who are PRPs. PRPs may be strictly, and often
jointly and severally, liable for clean-up. On September 3, 2003, the EPA advised APS that the EPA
considers APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52

nd

Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3
(OU3) in Phoenix, Arizona. APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site. APS and
Pinnacle West have agreed with the EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS
facilities within



OU3. Because the investigation has not yet been completed and ultimate remediation
requirements are not yet finalized, neither APS nor Pinnacle West can currently estimate the
expenditures which may be required.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

APS is currently investigating properties, which it now owns or
which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors, that were at one time sites of, or
sites associated with, manufactured gas plants. APS is taking action to voluntarily remediate
these sites. APS does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.

Navajo Nation Environmental Issues

Four Corners and the Navajo Generating Station are located on the Navajo Reservation and are
held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the Navajo Nation.
APS is the Four Corners operating agent. APS owns all of Four Corners Units 1, 2 and 3, and a 15%
interest in Four Corners Units 4 and 5. APS owns a 14% interest in Navajo Generating Station Units
1, 2 and 3.

In July 1995, the Navajo Nation enacted the Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control
Act, the Navajo Nation Safe Drinking Water Act and the Navajo Nation Pesticide Act (collectively,
the Navajo Acts). The Navajo Acts purport to give the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection
Agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality, drinking water and pesticide
activities, including those activities that occur at Four Corners and the Navajo Generating
Station. On October 17, 1995, the Four Corners participants and the Navajo Generating Station
participants each filed a lawsuit in the District Court of the Navajo Nation, Window Rock District,
challenging the applicability of the Navajo Acts as to Four Corners and the Navajo Generating
Station. The Court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties, and the
parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement.

In April 2000, the Navajo Tribal Council approved operating permit regulations under the
Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act. APS believes the regulations fail to
recognize that the Navajo Nation did not intend to assert jurisdiction over Four Corners and the
Navajo Generating Station. On July 12, 2000, the Four Corners participants and the Navajo
Generating Station participants each filed a petition with the Navajo Supreme Court for review of
the operating permit regulations. Those proceedings have been stayed, pending the settlement
negotiations mentioned above. APS cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter.

On May 18, 2005, APS, Salt River Project, as the operating agent for the Navajo Generating
Station, and the Navajo Nation executed a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (“VCA”) to resolve their
disputes regarding the Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act. On March 21, 2006,
the EPA determined that the Navajo Nation was eligible for “treatment as a state” for the purpose
of entering into a supplemental delegation agreement with the EPA to administer the Clean Air Act
Title V, Part 71 federal permit program over Four Corners and the Navajo Generating Station. The
EPA entered into the supplemental delegation agreement with the Navajo Nation on the same day.
Because the EPA’s approval was consistent with the requirements of the VCA, APS sought dismissal of
the pending litigation in the Navajo Nation Supreme Court, as well as the pending litigation in the
Navajo Nation District Court to the extent the claims relate to the Clean Air Act, and the Courts
have dismissed the claims accordingly. The agreement does not address or



resolve any dispute relating to other Navajo Acts. APS cannot currently predict the outcome
of this matter.

West Phoenix Power Plant

During the period from November 2004 through March 2005, the Maricopa County Air Quality
Department (“MCAQD”) issued a series of Notices of Violation (“NOVs”) to APS’ West Phoenix Power
Plant that generally allege that the plant failed to comply with applicable permit requirements.
The MCAQD subsequently rescinded most of the NOVs and imposed a penalty of approximately $20,000
for the remaining NOVs, which was paid in October 2006.

Water Supply

Assured supplies of water are important for APS’ generating plants. At the present time, APS
has adequate water to meet its needs. However, conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in
the southwestern United States have resulted in numerous court actions.

Both groundwater and surface water in areas important to APS’ operations have been the subject
of inquiries, claims and legal proceedings, which will require a number of years to resolve. APS
is one of a number of parties in a proceeding, filed March 13, 1975, before the Eleventh Judicial
District Court in New Mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for Four
Corners is derived. An agreement reached with the Navajo Nation in 1985, however, provides that if
Four Corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication, the Navajo Nation will provide, for
an agreed upon cost, sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss.

A summons served on APS in early 1986 required all water claimants in the Lower Gila River
Watershed in Arizona to assert any claims to water on or before January 20, 1987, in an action
pending in Maricopa County, Arizona, Superior Court. Palo Verde is located within the geographic
area subject to the summons. APS’ rights and the rights of the Palo Verde participants to the use
of groundwater and effluent at Palo Verde are potentially at issue in this action. As operating
agent of Palo Verde, APS filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the Palo Verde
participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to Palo Verde.
Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights. Five of APS’ other power plants are also
located within the geographic area subject to the summons. APS’ claims dispute the court’s
jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants. Alternatively, APS seeks
confirmation of such rights. In November 1999, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision
confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and Indian
tribes. In addition, in September 2000, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision affirming the
lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims. Litigation on both of these issues has
continued in the trial court. In December 2005, APS and other parties filed a petition with the
Arizona Supreme Court requesting interlocutory review of a September 2005 trial court order
regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights.
The Court has not yet ruled on the petition. No trial date concerning APS’ water rights claims
has been set in this matter.

APS has also filed claims to water in the Little Colorado River Watershed in Arizona in an
action pending in the Apache County, Arizona, Superior Court, which was originally filed on
September 5, 1985. APS’ groundwater resource utilized at Cholla is within the geographic area
subject to the adjudication and is therefore potentially at issue in the case. APS’ claims dispute
the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights. Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of
such



rights. A number of parties are in the process of settlement negotiations with respect to
certain claims in this matter. Other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in
motions filed with the court. No trial date concerning APS’ water rights claims has been set in
this matter.

Although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation, neither APS nor Pinnacle West
expects that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial
position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.

The Four Corners region, in which Four Corners is located, has been experiencing drought
conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in
the watershed that supplies the area. APS is continuing to work with area stakeholders to
implement agreements to minimize the effect, if any, on operations of the plant for 2007 and later
years. The effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time, and APS cannot predict the
ultimate outcome, if any, of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of
power available, or the price thereof, from Four Corners.

Federal Energy Legislation

On August 8, 2005, the President signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 into law. The Act
includes a wide range of provisions addressing many aspects of the energy industry. Specifically,
with respect to the electric utility industry, the Act includes provisions which, among other
things, repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 through enactment of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, effective as of February 8, 2006, creates incentives for the
construction of transmission infrastructure, eliminates the statutory restrictions on ownership of
qualifying facilities by electric utilities, establishes civil penalty authority over electric
utilities and expands the authority of the FERC to include overseeing the reliability of the bulk
power system. While we continue to monitor the impact of this new federal legislation, we cannot
predict the impact of the Act on our operations at this time.

Trading, the Company’s marketing and trading subsidiary.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection
with the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report, set forth below are
risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. Unless otherwise indicated or the
context otherwise requires, the following risks and uncertainties apply to Pinnacle West and its
subsidiaries, including APS.



APS is subject to comprehensive government regulation by several federal, state and local
regulatory agencies that significantly affect its business and results of operations.

APS is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal, state and local regulatory
agencies that significantly influence its business and results of operations. The ACC regulates
APS’ retail electric rates and APS’ issuance of securities. The ACC must also approve any transfer
of APS’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification
of certain transactions between us, APS and our respective affiliates. While approved electric
rates are intended to permit APS to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of
return, the profitability of APS is affected by the rates it may charge. Consequently, our
financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of
APS’ retail rate proceedings pending before the ACC.

APS is required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the agencies that
regulate APS’ business. The FERC, the NRC, the EPA, and the ACC regulate many aspects of our
utility operations, including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and, as noted
in the preceding paragraph, the rates that APS can charge customers. We believe the necessary
permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for APS’ existing operations and that APS’
business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects. However,
changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on
our results of operations. We are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating
results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies.

On
February 22, 2007, the NRC issued a “white” finding
(low to moderate safety significance) following an inspection of the
Palo Verde emergency diesel generators after a Palo Verde Unit 3
generator did not activate during routine inspections on July 25
and September 22, 2006. This finding, coupled with a previous
NRC “yellow” finding relating to a 2004 matter involving
Palo Verde’s safety injection systems, will result in an
enhanced NRC inspection regimen.

APS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may increase its cost of
operations, impact its business plans, or expose it to environmental liabilities.

APS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its
present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid
waste, and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating,
and other costs, particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions
obligations. These laws and regulations generally require APS to obtain and comply with a wide
variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay
in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval, or if APS fails to obtain, maintain or
comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to
additional expenses. In addition, failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and
regulations could result in civil liability or criminal penalties. Both public officials and
private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations. We cannot
predict the outcome (financial or operational) of any related litigation that may arise.

In addition, we may be a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a
regulatory body. We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures
related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean-up costs. There is
also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several
liability on all potentially responsible parties.

We cannot be sure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new
regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to us.
Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating
restrictions, particularly if those costs incurred by APS are not fully recoverable from APS’



customers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Concern over climate change could result in significant  legislative and regulatory
efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

Concern over climate change deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to significant legislative and
regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. In 1998, the United States became a
signatory to the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

.

The
Kyoto Protocol, which became effective in February 2005, calls for developed nations to reduce
their emissions of greenhouse gases to specified levels by 2012. CO2, which is a major byproduct of
the combustion of fossil fuel, is a greenhouse gas that would be regulated under the Kyoto
Protocol. The United States Senate indicated that it would not enact the Kyoto Protocol, and in
2002 President Bush confirmed that the United States would not enter into the Kyoto Protocol.
Instead, the President indicated that the United States would support voluntary measures for
reducing greenhouse gases and technologies that would use or dispose of CO2 effectively and
economically. As the Kyoto Protocol becomes effective in other countries, there is increasing
pressure for sources in the United States to be subject to mandatory restrictions on CO2 emissions.
In the last year, the United States Congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic
greenhouse gas emissions, but such bills have not received sufficient Congressional approval to
date to become law. If the United States ultimately ratifies the Kyoto Protocol and/or if the
United States Congress or individual states or groups of states in which we operate ultimately pass
legislation regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases, any resulting limitations on generation
facility CO2 emissions could have a material adverse impact on all fossil fuel fired generation
facilities (particularly coal fired facilities), including ours.

There are inherent risks in the operation of nuclear facilities, such as environmental, health
and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack.

Through APS, we have an ownership interest in and operate, on behalf of a group of owners,
Palo Verde, which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the United States. Palo
Verde is subject to environmental, health and financial risks such as the ability to dispose of
spent nuclear fuel; the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning; potential
liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities; the costs of securing the facilities
against possible terrorist attacks; and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems.
APS maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its
financial exposure to some of these risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed the
amount of insurance coverage.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related
requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of noncompliance,
the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its
assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. In addition, although
we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at Palo Verde, if an incident did occur,
it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. A major
incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the
operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.



The operation of Palo Verde requires licenses that need to be periodically renewed and/or
extended. We do not anticipate any problems renewing these licenses. However, as a result of
potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities, the licensing process could
result in increased licensing or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to predict.

The operation of power generation facilities involves risks that could result in unscheduled
power outages or reduced output, which could materially affect our results of operations.

The operation of power generation facilities involves certain risks, including the risk of
breakdown or failure of equipment, fuel interruption, and performance below expected levels of
output or efficiency. Unscheduled outages, including extensions of scheduled outages due to
mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our
business. If APS’ facilities operate below expectations, we may lose revenue or incur additional
expenses.

Deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition,
which could have a significant adverse impact on our business and our financial results.

In 1999, the ACC approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in
Arizona. Retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on APS due to an
impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of
capital. Although some very limited retail competition existed in APS’ service area in 1999 and
2000, there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility
services to APS’ customers. As a result, we cannot predict when, and the extent to which,
additional competitors will re-enter APS’ service territory.

As a result of changes in federal law and regulatory policy, competition in the wholesale
electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater participation by traditional electricity
suppliers, non-utility generators, independent power producers, and wholesale power marketers and
brokers. This increased competition could affect APS’ load forecasts, plans for power supply and
wholesale energy sales and related revenues. As a result of the changing regulatory environment
and the relatively low barriers to entry, we expect wholesale competition to increase.

Changes in technology may adversely affect our business.

Research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce
power, including fuel cells, micro turbines, clean coal and coal gasification, photovoltaic (solar)
cells and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient gas
turbines. Advances in these, or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production,
making APS’ generating facilities less competitive. In addition, advances in technology could
reduce the demand for power supply, which could adversely affect APS’ business.

Our results of operations can be adversely affected by milder weather.

Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of
energy commodities. Electric power demand is generally a seasonal business. In Arizona, demand
for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. As a



result, our overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In
addition, APS has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather
conditions are milder. As a result, unusually mild weather could diminish our results of
operations and harm our financial condition.

Our cash flow largely depends on the performance of our subsidiaries.

We conduct our operations primarily through subsidiaries. Substantially all of our
consolidated assets are held by such subsidiaries. Accordingly, our cash flow is dependent upon
the earnings and cash flows of these subsidiaries and their distributions to us. The subsidiaries
are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to make distributions to us.

The debt agreements of some of our subsidiaries may restrict their ability to pay dividends,
make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us. An ACC financing order requires APS to
indefinitely maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40% and does not allow APS to pay common
dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold. The common equity
ratio, as defined in the ACC order, is common equity divided by common equity plus long-term debt,
including current maturities of long-term debt.

Our ability to meet our debt service obligations could be adversely affected because our debt
securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of our
subsidiaries.

Because we are structured as a holding company, all existing and future debt and other
liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt
securities. None of the indentures under which we or our subsidiaries may issue debt securities
limits our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the future. The
assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available, in the first instance, to service
their own debt and other obligations. Our ability to have the benefit of their assets and cash
flows, particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries,
would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their
creditors have been satisfied.

If we are not able to access capital at competitive rates, our ability to implement our
financial strategy will be adversely affected.

We rely on access to short-term money markets, longer-term capital markets and the bank
markets as a significant source of liquidity and for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash
flow from our operations. We believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial
markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain market disruptions may increase our
cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access one or more financial markets. Such
disruptions could include:

•

an economic downturn;

•

the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company;

•

increased market prices for electricity and gas;



•

terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of unrelated
energy companies;

•

changes in technology; or

•

the overall health of the utility or real estate industry.

Changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates, which would increase our
interest expense on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our current plans. Additionally,
an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by:

•

increasing the cost of future debt financing;

•

increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to
payments on our debt, which would reduce funds available to us for operations, future
business opportunities or other purposes; and

•

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less
debt.

A further reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period
of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its
judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Any downgrade could limit our access to capital
and increase our borrowing costs, which would diminish our financial results. We would likely be
required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and our potential pool of investors
and funding sources could decrease. In addition, borrowing costs under certain of our existing
credit facilities depend on our credit ratings. A downgrade could also require us to provide
additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various
counterparties. If our short-term ratings were to be lowered, it could limit our access to the
commercial paper market. We note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to
buy, sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any
other rating.

The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business and changing interest
rates and market conditions could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of
operations.

Our operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices and, subject to
specified risk parameters, engaging in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from
market price movements. We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and
transportation costs of electricity, natural gas, coal, and emissions allowances. We have
established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing
various commodity derivatives, including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter
forwards, options, and swaps. As part of our overall risk management program, we enter into
derivative transactions to



hedge purchases and sales of electricity, fuels, and emissions allowances and credits. The
changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged
commodity.

We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties. We
use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties.
Despite the fact that the majority of trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the
rating agencies, there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default,
resulting in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period.

Changing interest rates affect interest paid on variable-rate debt and interest earned on
variable-rate securities in our pension plan, other postretirement benefit plan and nuclear
decommissioning trust funds. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a
combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. The pension plan and other postretirement
benefit liabilities are also impacted by the discount rate, which is the interest rate used to
discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Declining interest rates
impact the discount rate, and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit
costs, cash contributions, regulatory assets, and charges to other comprehensive income. The
pension plan, other postretirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning trust funds also have risks
associated with changing market values of fixed income and equity investments. A significant
portion of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear
decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices.

Actual results could differ from estimates used to prepare our financial statements.

In preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, management must often make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures at
the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Some of those judgments can
be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the
following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties, judgments and
complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved.

•

Regulatory Accounting — Regulatory accounting allows for the actions of
regulators, such as the ACC and the FERC, to be reflected in our financial statements.
Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an
expense in the current period by unregulated companies. If future recovery of costs
ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current period
earnings. A major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and purchased
power costs deferred under the PSA, a portion of which is subject to a prudence review
by the ACC as a result of unplanned Palo Verde outages in 2005 and 2006.

•

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting — Changes in our actuarial
assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability
and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position. The
most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability
and net periodic cost, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to
estimate earnings on invested funds over the long-term, and the assumed healthcare cost
trend rates. We review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as
necessary.



•

Derivative Accounting — Derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are
complex and subject to varying interpretations. Our evaluation of these rules, as they
apply to our contracts, will determine whether we use accrual accounting (for contracts
designated as normal) or fair value (mark-to-market) accounting. Mark-to-market
accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in
income unless certain hedge criteria are met. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss
on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item associated
with the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the effective
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock
equity (as a component of other comprehensive income (loss)) and are recognized in
earnings when the related transaction occurs.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response
to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:

In addition, the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been
unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations
may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.



We may enter into credit and other agreements from time to time that restrict our ability to
pay dividends.

Payment of dividends on our common stock may be restricted by credit and other agreements
entered into by us from time to time. There are currently no material restrictions on our ability
to pay dividends under any such agreement.

SunCor’s business and financial performance could be adversely affected by a variety of
factors affecting the real estate market.

SunCor’s business and financial performance could be adversely affected by a variety of
factors affecting the real estate market, including downward changes in general economic, real
estate construction or other business conditions; the potential overvaluation of land and new
homes, which could result in an economic down cycle for the homebuilding industry; future increases
in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the effective costs of
owning a home, which could prevent potential customers from buying homes in SunCor’s developments;
competition for homebuyers or commercial customers or partners, which could reduce SunCor’s
profitability; supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and
building materials, which could increase costs and delay deliveries; government regulations, which
could increase the cost and limit the availability of SunCor’s development, homebuilding and
commercial projects; and inflation, which could result in increased costs that SunCor may not be
able to recoup if demand declines.

Reserve Margin

APS’ 2006 peak one-hour demand on its electric system was recorded on July 21, 2006 at
7,652,000 kW, compared with the 2005 peak of 6,999,600 kW recorded on July 18, 2005. Taking into
account additional capacity then available to APS under long-term
purchased power contracts as well
as APS’ generating capacity, APS’ capability of meeting system demand on July 21, 2006, amounted to
6,783,000 kW, for an installed reserve margin of negative 12.7%. The power actually available to
APS from its resources fluctuates from time to time due in part to planned and unplanned plant and
transmission outages and technical problems. The available capacity from sources actually operable
at the time of the 2006 peak amounted to 5,706,000 kW, for a margin of a negative 35.6%. Firm
purchases totaling 3,522,000 kW, including short-term seasonal purchases and unit contingent
purchases, were in place at the time of the peak, ensuring the ability to meet the load requirement
with an actual reserve margin of 7.0%.

See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company – Purchased Power and Generating Fuel –
Purchased Power” in Item 1 for information about certain of APS’ long-term power agreements.



Plant Sites Leased from Navajo Nation

The Navajo Generating Station and Four Corners are located on land held under easements from
the federal government and also under leases from the Navajo Nation. These are long-term
agreements, and the leases contain options to extend. APS does not believe that the risks with
respect to enforcement of these easements and leases are material. The majority of coal contracted
for use in these plants and certain associated transmission lines are also located on Indian
reservations. See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company – Purchased Power and Generating
Fuel – Coal Supply” in Item 1.

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station

Regulatory

Operation of each of the three Palo Verde units requires an operating license from the NRC.
The NRC issued full power operating licenses for Unit 1 in June 1985, Unit 2 in April 1986 and Unit
3 in November 1987. The full power operating licenses, each valid for a period of approximately 40
years, authorize APS, as operating agent for Palo Verde, to operate the three Palo Verde units at
full power.

See
“NRC Inspection” in Note 11 in Item 8 for information
regarding an NRC finding relating to an NRC inspection that will
result in an enhanced NRC inspection regimen.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

The NRC rules on financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning of nuclear power
plants provide that a licensee may use a trust as the exclusive financial assurance mechanism if
the licensee recovers estimated total decommissioning costs through cost-of-service rates or
through a “non-bypassable charge.” The “non-bypassable systems benefits” charge is the charge that
the ACC has approved for APS’ recovery of certain types of costs, including costs for low income
programs, demand side management, consumer education, environmental, renewables, etc.
“Non-bypassable” means that if a customer chooses to take energy from an “energy service provider”
other than APS, the customer will still have to pay this charge as part of the customer’s APS
electric bill.

Other mechanisms are prescribed, including prepayment, if the requirements for exclusive
reliance on an external sinking fund mechanism are not met. APS currently relies on an external
sinking fund mechanism to meet the NRC financial assurance requirements for its interests in Palo
Verde Units 1, 2 and 3. The decommissioning costs of Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3 are currently
included in APS’ ACC jurisdictional rates. Decommissioning costs are recoverable through a
non-bypassable “system benefits” charge, which allows APS to maintain its external sinking fund
mechanism. See Note 12 in Item 8 for additional information about APS’ nuclear decommissioning
costs.

Palo Verde Liability and Insurance Matters

See “Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station” in Note 11 in Item 8 for a discussion of the
insurance maintained by the Palo Verde participants, including APS, for Palo Verde.

Palo Verde Leases

In 1986, APS sold about 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain common facilities in
three separate sale leaseback transactions. APS accounts for these leases as operating leases.
The leases, which have terms of 29.5 years, contain options to renew the leases and to purchase the
property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms. See Notes 9 and 20 in Item 8 for
additional information regarding the Palo Verde Unit 2 sale leaseback transactions.

Transmission
and Distribution Facilities

APS’ transmission facilities consist of approximately 5,712 pole miles of overhead lines and
approximately 43 miles of underground lines, 5,486 miles of which are located within the State of
Arizona. APS’ distribution facilities consist of approximately 12,355 pole miles of overhead lines
and approximately 15,222 miles of underground lines, all of which are located within the State of
Arizona.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Pinnacle West’s Consolidated
Financial Statements and Arizona Public Service Company’s Financial Statements and the related
Notes that appear in Item 8 of this report.

OVERVIEW

Pinnacle West owns all of the outstanding common stock of APS. APS is a vertically-integrated
electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of
Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson
metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona. APS has historically accounted for a
substantial part of our revenues and earnings, and is expected to continue to do so. Customer
growth in APS’ service territory is about three times the national average and remains a
fundamental driver of our revenues and earnings.

The ACC regulates APS’ retail electric rates. The key issue affecting Pinnacle West’s and
APS’ financial outlook is the satisfactory resolution of APS’ retail rate proceedings pending
before the ACC. As discussed in greater detail in Note 3, these proceedings consist of:

•

a general retail rate case pursuant to which APS is requesting a 20.4%, or $434.6
million, increase in its annual retail electricity revenues;

•

an application for a temporary rate increase of approximately 1.9%, through a PSA
surcharge, to recover $45 million in retail fuel and purchased power costs relating to
Palo Verde’s 2005 unplanned outages that were deferred by APS in 2005 under the PSA and
are subject to the ACC’s completion of an inquiry regarding the outages (this matter is
now being addressed in the general retail rate case); and

•

the ACC’s prudency review of amounts collected through the May 2, 2006 interim PSA
adjustor (see “Interim Rate Increase” in Note 3) related to unplanned 2006 Palo Verde
outages. The related PSA deferrals were approximately $79 million in 2006.

SunCor, our real estate development subsidiary, has been and is expected to be an important
source of earnings. See discussion below in “Pinnacle West Consolidated – Factors Affecting our
Financial Outlook – Subsidiaries.” Our subsidiary, APS Energy Services, provides competitive
commodity-related energy services and energy-related products and services to commercial and
industrial retail customers in the western United States. El Dorado, our investment subsidiary,
owns minority interests in several energy-related investments and Arizona community-based ventures.

Pinnacle West Energy was a subsidiary that owned and operated unregulated generating plants.
Pursuant to the ACC’s April 7, 2005 order in APS’ retail rate settlement, on July 29, 2005,
Pinnacle West Energy transferred the PWEC Dedicated Assets to APS. Pinnacle West Energy sold its
75% interest in Silverhawk to NPC on January 10, 2006. See Note 22 for a discussion of
discontinued operations. As a result, Pinnacle West Energy no longer owned any generating plants
and was dissolved as of August 31, 2006.



We continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and
delivery activities. In the delivery area, we focus on superior reliability and customer
satisfaction. We plan to expand long-term resources and our transmission and distribution systems
to meet the electricity needs of our growing retail customers and sustain reliability.

See “Pinnacle West Consolidated – Factors Affecting Our Financial Outlook” below for a
discussion of several factors that could affect our future financial results.

PINNACLE WEST CONSOLIDATED –

EARNINGS CONTRIBUTION BY BUSINESS SEGMENT

Pinnacle West’s two principal business segments are:

As of December 31, 2006, our marketing and trading activities are no longer considered a segment
requiring separate reporting or disclosure. The marketing and trading activities consist of our
competitive energy business, including wholesale marketing and trading and retail commodity-related
energy services. These activities have decreased as a result of fewer market opportunities and the
Company’s intention to deemphasize that part of our business. These activities are now reported as
part of the “Other” category in the table below. The corresponding information for earlier periods
has been reclassified.

PINNACLE WEST CONSOLIDATED – RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to “gross
margin.” With respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading
contributions, gross margin refers to operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs.
“Gross margin” is a “non-GAAP financial measure,” as defined in accordance with SEC rules. Exhibit
99.29 reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to operating income, which is the most directly
comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We view gross margin as an important performance
measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure is a key component of our
internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business segments. We
believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our
management uses.

Deferred Fuel and Purchased Power Costs

Our subsidiary, APS, settled its 2003 general retail rate case effective April 1, 2005. As
part of the settlement, the ACC approved the PSA, which permits APS to defer for recovery or refund
fluctuations in retail fuel and purchased power costs, subject to specified parameters. In
accordance with the PSA, APS defers for future rate recovery 90% of the difference between actual
retail fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base
rates. APS’ recovery of PSA deferrals from its customers is subject to the ACC’s approval of
annual PSA adjustments and periodic surcharge applications. See “Power Supply Adjustor” in Note 3.

Since the inception of the PSA, APS has incurred substantially higher fuel and purchased power
costs than those authorized for recovery through APS’ current base rates primarily due to the use
of higher cost resources and has deferred those cost differences in accordance with the PSA. The
balance of APS’ PSA deferrals at December 31, 2006 was approximately $160 million. The recovery of
PSA deferrals through ACC approved adjustors and surcharges recorded as revenue is offset
dollar-for-dollar by the amortization of those deferred expenses recorded as fuel and purchased
power.

APS operated Palo Verde Unit 1 at reduced power levels from December 25, 2005 until March 18,
2006 due to vibration levels in one of the Unit’s shutdown cooling lines. During an outage at Unit
1 from March 18, 2006 to July 7, 2006, APS performed the necessary work and modifications to remedy
the situation. APS estimates that incremental replacement power costs resulting from these and
other unplanned Palo Verde outages and reduced power levels were approximately $88 million during
2006. The related impact on the PSA deferrals was an increase of approximately $79 million. These
Palo Verde replacement power costs were partially offset by $42 million of lower than expected
replacement power costs related to APS’ other generating units during 2006, which decreased PSA
deferrals by $38 million.

The PSA deferral balance at December 31, 2006 includes (a) $45 million related to replacement
power costs associated with unplanned 2005 Palo Verde outages and (b) $79 million related to
replacement power costs associated with unplanned 2006 outages or reduced power operations at Palo
Verde. The PSA deferrals associated with these unplanned Palo Verde outages



and reduced power operations are the subject of ACC prudence reviews. The ACC staff has
recommended disallowance of $17 million of the 2005 costs. The recommendation will be considered
as part of APS’ general rate case currently before the ACC. See “PSA Deferrals Related to
Unplanned Palo Verde Outages” in Note 3. The ACC staff recommendation does not change management’s
belief that the expenses in question were prudently incurred and, therefore, are recoverable. See
Note 3.

2006 Compared with 2005

Our consolidated net income for 2006 was $327 million compared with $176 million for the
comparable prior-year period. The prior year included a net loss from discontinued operations of
$47 million, which was related to the sale and operations of Silverhawk, partially offset by income
from sales of real estate commercial properties at SunCor. Income from continuing operations
increased $94 million in the period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in
earnings by segment:

•

Regulated Electricity Segment – Income from continuing operations increased
approximately $92 million primarily due to an $84 million after-tax regulatory
disallowance of plant costs recorded in 2005. Income also increased due to higher
retail sales volumes due to customer growth; income tax credits related to prior years
resolved in 2006; and increased other income due to higher interest income on higher
investment balances. These positive factors were partially offset by higher operations
and maintenance expense related to generation and customer service; and higher
depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant asset balances,
partially offset by lower depreciation rates. In addition, higher fuel and purchased
power costs of $74 million after-tax were partially offset by the deferral of $45
million after-tax of costs in accordance with the PSA. See discussion – “Deferred Fuel
and Purchased Power Costs” above.

•

Real Estate Segment – Income from continuing operations increased approximately $15
million primarily due to increased margins on residential sales and the sale of certain
joint venture assets, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses.
Income from discontinued operations decreased $7 million due to lower commercial
property sales.

•

Other – Income from continuing operations decreased approximately $13 million
primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains, partially offset by higher unit margins on
wholesale sales and competitive retail sales in California.

Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues

Regulated electricity segment revenues were $398 million higher for 2006 compared with the
prior-year period primarily as a result of:

•

a $265 million increase in revenues related to recovery of PSA
deferrals, which had no earnings effect because of amortization of the same amount
recorded as fuel and purchased power expense (see “Deferred Fuel and Purchased Power
Costs” above);



•

a $124 million increase in retail revenues related to customer growth,
excluding weather effects;

•

a $6 million increase in Off-System Sales primarily resulting from $12
million of sales previously reported in marketing and trading that were classified
beginning in April 2005 as sales in the regulated electricity segment in accordance
with APS’ 2003 general retail rate case settlement, partially offset by $6 million of
lower Off-System Sales in 2006; and

•

a $3 million increase due to miscellaneous factors.

Real Estate Segment Revenues

Real estate segment revenues were $62 million higher for 2006 compared with the prior-year
period primarily as a result of:

•

a $55 million increase in residential sales due to higher prices and volumes; and

•

a $7 million increase in commercial real estate sales.

Other Revenues

Other revenues were $25 million lower for 2006 compared with the prior-year period primarily
as a result of decreased sales-related products and services by APS Energy Services.

Marketing and trading revenues were $21 million lower for 2006 compared with the prior-year
period primarily as a result of:

•

a $20 million decrease in mark-to-market gains on contracts for future
delivery due to changes in forward prices;

•

a $12 million decrease in Off-System Sales due to the absence of sales
previously reported in marketing and trading that were classified beginning in April
2005 as sales in the regulated electricity segment in accordance with APS’ 2003 general
retail rate case settlement;

•

a $23 million increase from higher prices on competitive retail sales in
California; and

•

a $12 million decrease due to miscellaneous factors.

2005 Compared with 2004

Our consolidated net income for 2005 was $176 million compared with $243 million for the prior
year. The 2005 net income included an after-tax net loss from discontinued operations of $47
million compared with a $4 million after-tax loss in the prior year, which for both years is
related primarily to the sale and operations of Silverhawk, partially offset by sales of commercial
properties at SunCor. Income from continuing operations decreased $24 million in the
period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment:



•

Regulated Electricity Segment – Income from continuing operations increased
approximately $15 million primarily due to deferred fuel and purchased power costs; a
retail price increase effective April 1, 2005; higher retail sales volumes due to
customer growth; lower depreciation due to lower depreciation rates; lower regulatory
asset amortization; and effects of weather on retail sales. These positive factors
were partially offset by the regulatory disallowance of plant costs in accordance with
the APS retail rate case settlement; higher fuel and purchased power costs primarily
due to higher prices and more plant outage days; higher operations and maintenance
expense related to generation and customer service; and higher property taxes due to
increased plant in service.

•

Real Estate Segment – Income from continuing operations decreased approximately $5
million primarily due to decreased parcel sales, partially offset by increased margins
on home sales. Income from discontinued real estate operations increased $13 million
due to higher commercial property sales.

•

Other – Income from continuing operations decreased approximately $34 million
primarily due to an after-tax gain related to the sale of a limited partnership
interest in the Phoenix Suns recorded in 2004 and due to lower unit margins on
competitive retail sales in California.

Real estate segment revenues were $12 million lower for 2005 compared with the prior year
primarily due to decreased parcel sales, partially offset by increased home sales at SunCor.

Other Revenues

Other revenues were $31 million lower for 2005 compared with the prior year primarily as a
result of:

•

a $40 million decrease in Off-System Sales due to the absence of sales
previously reported as marketing and trading revenues that were classified beginning in
April 2005 as sales in the regulated electricity segment in accordance with the APS
retail rate case settlement;

Consists primarily of capital expenditures for residential, land development
and retail and office building construction reflected in “Real estate investments” and
“Capital expenditures” on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions
and upgrades, capital replacements, new customer construction and related information systems and
facility costs. Examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include lines,
substations, line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to
customer information systems. Major transmission projects are driven by strong regional customer
growth.

Generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to APS’ existing fossil
and nuclear plants and the replacement of Palo Verde steam generators (see below). Examples of the
types of projects included in this category are additions, upgrades and capital replacements of
various power plant equipment such as turbines, boilers and
environmental equipment. Environmental expenditures are estimated at
approximately $80 million to $100 million per year for
2007, 2008 and 2009. Generation
also includes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately $50 million for 2007, and approximately
$75 million per year for 2008 and 2009.

The Palo Verde owners have approved the manufacture of one additional set of steam generators.
These generators will be installed in Unit 3 and are scheduled for completion in the Fall of 2007
at an approximate cost of $70 million (APS’ share). Approximately $30 million of the Unit 3 steam
generator costs have been incurred through December 31, 2006, with the remaining $40



million
included in the capital expenditures table above. Capital expenditures will be funded with
internally generated cash and/or external financings.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate VIE lessors in order to sell and
lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2. The leases are accounted for as operating leases in
accordance with GAAP. We are not the primary beneficiary of the Palo Verde VIEs and, accordingly,
do not consolidate them.



APS is exposed to losses under the Palo Verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of
certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur. Under certain
circumstances (for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde
or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to assume the debt associated
with the transactions, make specified payments to the equity participants, and take title to the
leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If
such an event had occurred as of December 31, 2006, APS would have been required to assume
approximately $214 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately $177 million.

Guarantees and Letters of Credit

We and certain of our subsidiaries have issued guarantees and letters of credit in support of
our unregulated businesses. We have also obtained surety bonds on behalf of APS Energy Services.
We have not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to these
obligations. We generally agree to indemnification provisions related to liabilities arising from
or related to certain of our agreements, with limited exceptions depending on the particular
agreement. See Note 21 for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit.

Credit Ratings

The
ratings of securities of Pinnacle West and APS as of February 28, 2007 are shown below.
The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies, from which an explanation of the
significance of their ratings may be obtained. There is no assurance that these ratings will
continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the
rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Any downward
revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s or APS’ securities
and serve to increase the cost of and access to capital. It may also require additional collateral
related to certain derivative instruments (see Note 18).

Debt Provisions

Pinnacle West’s and APS’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing
arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios. Certain of APS’ bank financing arrangements
also include an interest coverage test. Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants and each
anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements. For both
Pinnacle West and APS, these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total
consolidated capitalization not exceed 65%. At December 31, 2006, the ratio was approximately 48%
for Pinnacle West and 46% for APS. The provisions regarding interest coverage require a minimum
cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for APS. The interest coverage was
approximately 4.7 times under APS’ bank financing agreements as of December 31, 2006. Failure to
comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking,
would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross-default
other debt. See further discussion of “cross-default” provisions below.

Neither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’ financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would
result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating
downgrade. However, in the event of a rating downgrade, Pinnacle West and/or APS may be subject to
increased interest costs under certain financing agreements.

All of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in
defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or
APS were to default under certain other material agreements. All of APS’ bank agreements contain
cross-default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment
under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.
Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings.

See Note 6 for further discussions.

Capital Needs and Resources

Pinnacle West (Parent Company)

Our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest
payments on our long-term debt. On October 18, 2006, our Board of Directors increased the common
stock dividend to an indicated annual rate of $2.10 per share from $2.00 per share, effective with
the December 1, 2006 dividend payment. The level of our common stock dividends and future dividend
growth will be dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, payout ratio trends,
free cash flow and financial market conditions.

Our primary sources of cash are dividends from APS, external financings and cash distributions
from our other subsidiaries, primarily SunCor. For the years 2004 through 2006, total dividends
from APS were $510 million and total distributions from SunCor were $145 million. For 2006, cash
contributions from APS were $170 million and distributions from SunCor were $10 million. An
existing ACC order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40% and prohibits APS
from paying common stock dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that
threshold. As defined in the ACC order, the common equity ratio is common equity divided by the
sum of common equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt. At
December 31, 2006, APS’ common equity ratio, as defined, was approximately 53%.



At December 31, 2006, Pinnacle West’s outstanding long-term debt, including current
maturities, was $175 million. Pinnacle West has a $300 million revolving credit facility that
terminates in December 2010. This line of credit is available to support the issuance of up to
$250 million in commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings, including issuances of letters
of credit. At December 31, 2006, we had $28 million of commercial paper outstanding.

Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a
non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and
its subsidiaries. IRS regulations require us to contribute a minimum
amount to the qualified plan. We contribute at least the minimum amount required under IRS regulations, but no
more than the maximum tax-deductible amount. The minimum required funding takes into consideration
the value of plan assets and our pension obligation. The assets in the plan are comprised of
common stocks, bonds, fixed-income securities and domestic equity securities and short-term
investments. Future year contribution amounts are dependent on fund performance and plan asset
valuation assumptions. We contributed approximately $47 million in 2006. The contribution to our
pension plan in 2007 is estimated to be approximately $24 million. The expected contribution to
our other postretirement benefit plans in 2007 is estimated to be approximately $25 million. APS
and other subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions. APS’ share is approximately 97% of
both plans.

In January 2006, Pinnacle West infused into APS $210 million of the proceeds from the sale of
Silverhawk. See “Equity Infusions” in Note 3 for more information.

On February 28, 2006, Pinnacle West entered into an Uncommitted Master Shelf Agreement with
Prudential Investment Management, Inc. (“Prudential”) and certain of its affiliates. The agreement
provides the terms under which Pinnacle West may offer up to $200 million of its senior notes for
purchase by Prudential affiliates at any time prior to December 31, 2007. The maturity of notes
issued under the agreement cannot exceed five years. Pursuant to the agreement, on February 28,
2006, Pinnacle West issued and sold to Prudential affiliates $175 million of its 5.91% Senior
Notes, Series A, due February 28, 2011 (the “Series A Notes”).

On April 3, 2006, Pinnacle West repaid $300 million of its 6.40% Senior Notes due April 2006.
Pinnacle West used the proceeds of the Series A Notes, cash on hand and commercial paper proceeds
to repay these notes.

On January 4, 2007, the FERC issued an order permitting Pinnacle West to transfer its market
based rate tariff and wholesale power sales agreements to a newly-created Pinnacle West subsidiary,
Pinnacle West Marketing & Trading. Pinnacle West completed the transfer on February 1, 2007, which
resulted in Pinnacle West no longer being a public utility under the Federal Power Act. As a
result, Pinnacle West is no longer subject to FERC jurisdiction in connection with its issuance of
securities or its incurrence of long-term debt.

APS

APS’ capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and optional and mandatory
redemptions of long-term debt. APS pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations
and, to the extent necessary, external financings. APS has historically paid its dividends to
Pinnacle West with cash from operations. See “Pinnacle West (Parent Company)” above for a



discussion of the common equity ratio that APS must maintain in order to pay dividends to Pinnacle
West.

Although provisions in APS’ articles of incorporation and ACC financing orders establish
maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that APS may issue, APS does not expect any of these
provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements. On December 15, 2006, APS filed
a financing application with the ACC requesting an increase in APS’ current long-term debt
authorization (approximately $3.2 billion) to approximately $4.2 billion in light of the projected
growth of APS and its customer base and the resulting projected future financing needed to fund
APS’ capital expenditure and maintenance program and other cash requirements.

On August 3, 2006, APS issued $400 million of debt as follows: $250 million of its 6.25%
Notes due 2016 and $150 million of its 6.875% Notes due 2036. A portion of the proceeds was used
to pay at maturity approximately $84 million of APS’ 6.75% Senior Notes due November 15, 2006.
The remainder may be used to fund its construction program and other
general corporate purposes.

On September 28, 2006, APS put in place an additional $500 million revolving credit facility
that terminates in September 2011. APS may increase the amount of the facility up to a maximum
facility of $600 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. APS will use the facility
for general corporate purposes. The facility can also be used for the issuance of letters of
credit. Interest rates are based on APS’ senior unsecured debt credit ratings.

See “Deferred Fuel and Purchased Power Costs” above and “Power Supply Adjustor” in Note 3 for
information regarding the PSA approved by the ACC. Although APS defers actual retail fuel and
purchased power costs on a current basis, APS’ recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is
subject to the ACC’s approval of annual PSA adjustments and periodic surcharge applications.
During 2006, APS recovered approximately $265 million of PSA deferrals, which provided cash flow
but had no effect on earnings because of amortization of the same amount recorded as fuel and
purchased power expense.

APS’ outstanding debt was approximately $2.9 billion at December 31, 2006. APS has two
committed lines of credit totaling $900 million that are available either to support the issuance
of up to $250 million in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings, including issuances of
letters of credit. The $400 million line terminates in December 2010 and the $500 million line
terminates in September 2011. At December 31, 2006, APS had no outstanding commercial paper or
bank borrowings. APS ended 2006 in an invested cash position.

See “Cash Flow Hedges” in Note 18 for information related to decreased collateral provided to
us by counterparties and the change in our margin account.

Other Subsidiaries

During the past three years, SunCor funded its cash requirements with cash from operations and
its own external financings. SunCor’s capital needs consist primarily of capital expenditures for
land development and retail and office building construction. See the capital expenditures table
above for actual capital expenditures during 2006 and projected capital expenditures for the next



three years. SunCor expects to fund its future capital requirements with cash from operations and
external financings.

SunCor’s total outstanding debt was approximately $189 million as of December 31, 2006,
including $118 million of debt classified as long-term debt under a $170 million line of credit.
SunCor’s long-term debt, including current maturities, was $181 million and total short-term debt
was $8 million at December 31, 2006. See Note 6.

See Note 22 for a discussion of the sale of Pinnacle West Energy’s 75% ownership interest in
Silverhawk.

El Dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus
on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments.

APS Energy Services and Pinnacle West Marketing & Trading expect minimal capital expenditures
over the next three years.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management must often make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting
period. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ
from those estimates. We consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical
because of the uncertainties, judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and
operations involved.

Regulatory Accounting

Regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators, such as the ACC and the FERC, to
be reflected in our financial statements. Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that
would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies. If
future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in
current period earnings. A major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power
costs deferred under the PSA. APS defers for future rate recovery 90% of the difference between
actual retail fuel and power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates.
We had $846 million, including $160 million related to the PSA, of regulatory assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006. Included in the $160 million is approximately
$45 million related to the 2005 unplanned Palo Verde outages and $79 million related to the 2006
unplanned outages, which currently are the subject of inquiry by the ACC.

At December 31, 2006, APS recorded a regulatory asset of $473 million in accordance with SFAS
No. 158 for pension and other postretirement benefits. This regulatory asset represents the future
recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings. If these
costs are disallowed by the ACC this regulatory asset would be charged to OCI.

In addition, we had $635 million of regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
at December 31, 2006, which primarily are related to removal costs. See Notes 1, 3 and 8 for more
information about regulatory assets, APS’ general rate case and the PSA.



Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting

Changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement
benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position.
The most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and
net periodic cost, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings
on invested funds over the long-term, and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates. We review these
assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.

The following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial
assumptions would have had on the December 31, 2006 reported pension liability on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets and our 2006 reported pension expense, after consideration of amounts capitalized or
billed to electric plant participants, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income

See Note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Derivative Accounting

Derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying
interpretations. Our evaluation of these rules, as they apply to our contracts, determines whether
we use accrual accounting (for contracts designated as normal) or fair value (mark-to-market)
accounting. Mark-to-market accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized
periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met. For fair value hedges, the gain or
loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item associated with
the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes
in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in common stock equity (as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss)).

The fair value of our derivative contracts is not always readily determinable. In some cases,
we use models and other valuation techniques to determine fair value. The use of these models and
valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment. Actual results could
differ from the results estimated through application of these methods. Our marketing and trading
portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that
protects the economic value of the sales transactions. See “Market Risks – Commodity Price Risk”
below for quantitative analysis. See Note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and Note 18 for
a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting.



OTHER ACCOUNTING MATTERS

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” This guidance requires us to
recognize the tax benefits of an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the
benefit will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority. A tax position that meets the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold must be recognized in the financial statements at the
largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. The Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2006. We are currently evaluating this new guidance and believe it will not have a material impact
on  retained earnings.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” This
guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. The Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We
are currently evaluating this new guidance.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.”
SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report
selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS
No. 159 is effective for us on January 1, 2008. We are
currently evaluating the impact of this new standard.

See the following Notes for information about new accounting standards:

•

See Note 8 and Note S-6 for a discussion of SFAS No. 158 on pension and other postretirement
plans.

•

See Note 16 for a discussion of the accounting standard (SFAS No. 123(R)) on
stock-based compensation.

PINNACLE WEST CONSOLIDATED – FACTORS AFFECTING

OUR FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

Factors Affecting Operating Revenues, Fuel and Purchased Power Costs

General

Electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail
markets in Arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western United
States. For the years 2004 through 2006, retail electric revenues comprised approximately 82% of
our total electric operating revenues. Our electric operating revenues are affected by electricity
sales volumes related to customer mix, customer growth, average usage per customer, electricity
rates and tariffs, variations in weather from period to period, and amortization of PSA deferrals.
Competitive retail sales of energy and energy-related products and services are made by APS Energy
Services in certain western states that have opened to competition. Off-system sales of excess
generation output, purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment
revenues and related fuel and purchased power because the gross margin is credited to APS’ retail
customers through the PSA (see Note 3). These revenue transactions are affected by the
availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions,
including demand and prices. Competitive wholesale transactions are made by the marketing and
trading group through structured trading opportunities involving matched sales and purchases of
commodities.

Retail Rate Proceedings

The key issue affecting Pinnacle West’s and APS’ financial outlook is
the satisfactory resolution of APS’ retail rate proceedings pending before the ACC, which are
discussed in greater detail in Note 3. The most significant pending retail rate proceedings are
APS’ general rate case request and an application for a 1.9% PSA surcharge, or temporary rate
increase, related to incremental replacement power costs incurred by APS in 2005 in connection with



unplanned outages at Palo Verde, which is subject to the ACC’s review of the unplanned outages.
These matters have been consolidated procedurally and a decision on them by the ACC is expected in
the second quarter of 2007. In addition, the ACC staff is conducting a review of the prudence of
approximately $79 million in PSA deferrals related to 2006 unplanned outages at Palo Verde.

Fuel and Purchased Power Costs

Fuel and purchased power costs included on our income
statements are impacted by our electricity sales volumes, existing contracts for purchased power
and generation fuel, our power plant performance, transmission availability or constraints,
prevailing market prices, new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas, our
hedging program for managing such costs and, since April 1, 2005, PSA deferrals and amortization
thereof. See “Power Supply Adjustor” in Note 3 for information regarding the PSA, including PSA
deferrals related to Palo Verde unplanned outages and reduced power operations that are the subject
of ACC prudence reviews. See “Natural Gas Supply” in Note 11 for more information on fuel costs.
APS’ recovery of PSA deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to the ACC’s approval of annual PSA
adjustments and periodic surcharge applications.

Customer and Sales Growth

The customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph applies
to Native Load customers and sales to them. Customer growth in APS’ service territory was 4.4%
during 2006. Such growth averaged 4.1% a year for the three years from 2004 through 2006; and we
currently expect customer growth to average about 4.0% per year from 2007 to 2009. For the three
years 2004 through 2006, APS’ actual retail electricity sales in kilowatt-hours grew at an average
rate of 4.2%; adjusted to exclude effects of weather variations, such retail sales growth averaged
4.6% a year. We currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatt-hours will grow
3.2% on average, from 2007 through 2009, before the effects of weather variations. We currently
expect our retail sales growth in 2007 to be below average because of potential effects on customer
usage from the retail rate increases proposed by APS (see Note 3).

Actual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as
a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns and
responses to retail price changes. Our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation
in our kilowatt-hour sales projection attributable to such economic factors can result in increases
or decreases in annual net income of up to $10 million.

Weather

In forecasting retail sales growth, we assume normal weather patterns based on
historical data. Historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net
income in excess of $20 million. However, our experience indicates that the more typical
variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to
$10 million.

Wholesale Market Conditions

The marketing and trading group focuses primarily on managing
APS’ risks relating to fuel and purchased power costs in connection with its costs of serving
Native Load customer demand. The marketing and trading group, subject to specified parameters,
markets, hedges and trades in electricity, fuels and emission allowances and credits.

Other Factors Affecting Financial Results

Operations and Maintenance Expenses

Operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by
growth, power plant additions and operations, inflation, outages, higher-trending pension and other
postretirement benefit costs and other factors.



Depreciation and Amortization Expenses

Depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by
net additions to utility plant and other property, which include generation construction,
changes in depreciation and amortization rates, and changes in regulatory asset amortization.

Property Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes, which are
affected by the value of property in-service and under construction, assessed valuation ratios, and
tax rates. The average property tax rate for APS, which currently owns the majority of our
property, was 8.9% of assessed value for 2006 and 9.2% for 2005 and 2004. We expect property taxes
to increase as new power plants (including the Sundance Plant acquired in 2005) and additions to
our transmission and distribution facilities are included in the property tax base.

Interest Expense

Interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the
interest rates on that debt. The primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our
capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities, and internally generated cash flow. Capitalized
interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction. We
stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation.

Retail Competition

Although some very limited retail competition existed in Arizona in 1999
and 2000, there are currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled energy or other
utility services to APS’ customers. We cannot predict when, and the extent to which, additional
competitors will re-enter APS’ service territory.

Subsidiaries

SunCor’s net income was $61 million in 2006, $56 million in 2005, and $45
million in 2004. See Note 22 for further discussion. We currently expect SunCor’s net income in
2007 will be between $30 million and $35 million. This estimate reflects a slow-down in the
western United States residential real estate markets.

APS Energy Services’ and El Dorado’s historical results are not indicative of future
performance.

General

Our financial results may be affected by a number of broad factors. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” for further information on such factors, which may cause our actual
future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate.

Market Risks

Our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates, commodity
prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund.

Interest Rate and Equity Risk

We have exposure to changing interest rates. Changing interest rates will affect interest
paid on variable-rate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear
decommissioning trust fund (see Note 12). The nuclear decommissioning trust fund also has risks
associated with the changing market value of its investments. Nuclear decommissioning costs are
recovered in regulated electricity prices.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances. We manage risks associated with
these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives,
including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options and swaps.
Our ERMC, consisting of officers and key management personnel, oversees company-wide energy risk
management activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure
compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies. As part of our risk
management program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity, fuels and
emissions allowances and credits. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high
correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities. In addition, subject to specified risk
parameters monitored by the ERMC, we engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit
from market price movements.



The mark-to-market value of derivative instruments related to our risk management and trading
activities are presented in two categories:

•

Regulated Electricity – non-trading derivative instruments that hedge our purchases
and sales of electricity and fuel for APS’ Native Load requirements of our regulated
electricity business segment; and

•

Marketing and Trading – non-trading and trading derivative instruments of our
competitive business activities.

The following tables show the pretax changes in mark-to-market of our non-trading and trading
derivative positions in 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions):

ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY – RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to “gross
margin.” Gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs.
Gross margin is a “non-GAAP financial measure,” as defined in accordance with SEC rules. Exhibit
99.30 reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to operating income, which is the most directly
comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We view gross
margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This
measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in
analyzing our business. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial
measures that our management uses.

Deferred Fuel and Purchased Power Costs

The settlement of our 2003 general retail rate case became effective April 1, 2005. As part
of the settlement, the ACC approved the PSA, which permits APS to defer for recovery or refund
fluctuations in retail fuel and purchased power costs, subject to specified parameters. In
accordance with the PSA, APS defers for future rate recovery 90% of the difference between actual
retail fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base
rates. APS’ recovery of PSA deferrals from its customers is subject to the ACC’s approval of
annual PSA adjustments and periodic surcharge applications. See “Power Supply Adjustor” in Note 3.

Since the inception of the PSA, APS has incurred substantially higher fuel and purchased power
costs than those authorized for recovery through APS’ current base rates primarily due to the use
of higher cost resources and has deferred those cost differences in accordance with the PSA. The
balance of APS’ PSA deferrals at December 31, 2006 was approximately $160 million. The recovery of
PSA deferrals through ACC approved adjustors and surcharges recorded as revenue is offset
dollar-for-dollar by the amortization of those deferred expenses recorded as fuel and purchased
power.

APS operated Palo Verde Unit 1 at reduced power levels from December 25, 2005 until March 18,
2006 due to vibration levels in one of the Unit’s shutdown cooling lines. During an outage at Unit
1 from March 18, 2006 to July 7, 2006, APS performed the necessary work and modifications to remedy
the situation. APS estimates that incremental replacement power costs resulting from these and
other unplanned Palo Verde outages and reduced power levels were approximately $88 million during
2006. The related impact on the PSA deferrals was an increase of



approximately $79 million. These
Palo Verde replacement power costs were partially offset by $42 million of lower than expected
replacement power costs related to APS’ other generating units during 2006, which decreased PSA
deferrals by $38 million.

The PSA deferral balance at December 31, 2006 includes (a) $45 million related to replacement
power costs associated with unplanned 2005 Palo Verde outages and (b) $79 million related to
replacement power costs associated with unplanned 2006 outages or reduced power operations at Palo
Verde. The PSA deferrals associated with these unplanned Palo Verde outages and reduced power
operations are the subject of ACC prudence reviews. The ACC staff has recommended disallowance of
$17 million of the 2005 costs. The recommendation will be considered as part of APS’ general rate
case currently before the ACC. See “PSA Deferrals Related to Unplanned Palo Verde Outages” in Note
3. The ACC staff recommendation does not change management’s belief that the expenses in question
were prudently incurred and, therefore, are recoverable. See Note 3.

2006 Compared with 2005

APS’ net income for the 2006 was $270 million compared with $170 million for the comparable
prior-year period. The $100 million increase was primarily due to an $84 million after-tax
regulatory disallowance of plant costs recorded in 2005. Income also increased due to higher
retail sales volumes due to customer growth; higher marketing and trading gross margin primarily
due to higher mark-to-market gains; income tax credits related to prior years resolved in 2006; and
increased other income due to higher interest income on higher investment balances. These positive
factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense related to generation
and customer service; higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant asset
balances, partially offset by lower depreciation rates; and higher interest expense. In addition,
higher fuel and purchased power costs of $74 million after-tax were partially offset by the
deferral of $45 million after-tax of costs in accordance with the PSA. See discussion – “Deferred
Fuel and Purchased Power Costs” above.

Regulated Electricity Revenues

Regulated electricity revenues were $396 million higher for 2006 compared with the prior-year
period primarily as a result of:

•

a $265 million increase in revenues related to recovery of PSA
deferrals, which had no earnings effect because of amortization of the same amount
recorded as fuel and purchased power expense (see “Deferred Fuel and Purchased Power
Costs” above);



•

a $124 million increase in retail revenues related to customer growth,
excluding weather effects;

•

a $6 million increase in Off-System Sales primarily resulting from $12
million of sales previously reported in marketing and trading that were classified
beginning in April 2005 as sales in regulated electricity in accordance with APS’ 2003
general retail rate case settlement, partially offset by $6 million of lower Off-System
Sales in 2006; and

•

a $1 million increase due to miscellaneous factors.

Marketing and Trading Revenues

Marketing and trading revenues were $8 million lower for 2006 compared with the prior-year
period primarily as a result of:

•

a $12 million decrease in Off-System Sales due to the absence of sales
previously reported in marketing and trading that were classified beginning in April
2005 as sales in regulated electricity in accordance with APS’ 2003 general retail rate
case settlement;

•

a $12 million increase in mark-to-market gains on contracts for future
delivery due to changes in forward prices; and

•

an $8 million decrease in energy trading revenues on realized sales of
electricity primarily due to lower delivered electricity prices and lower volumes.

2005 Compared with 2004

APS’ net income for 2005 was $170 million compared with $200 million for the prior year. The
$30 million decrease was primarily due to the regulatory disallowance of plant costs in accordance
with the APS retail rate case settlement; higher fuel and purchased power costs primarily due to
higher prices and more plant outage days; higher operations and maintenance expense related to
generation and customer service costs; and higher property taxes due to increased plant in service.
These negative factors were partially offset by deferred fuel and purchased power costs; a retail
price increase effective April 1, 2005; higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth; lower
depreciation due to lower depreciation rates; lower regulatory asset amortization; and effects of
weather on retail sales.

period primarily as a result of:

•

a $40 million decrease in Off-System Sales due to the absence of sales
previously reported in marketing and trading that were classified beginning in April
2005 as sales in regulated electricity in accordance with the APS retail rate case
settlement; and

•

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

(PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION)

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13(a)-15(f), for Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework,

our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. Our
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein and relates also to the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

February 28, 2007



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Pinnacle West Capital Corporation

Phoenix, Arizona

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in common stock equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
listed in the Index at Item 15. We also have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedules, an opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment that
the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

As discussed in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, effective December 31, 2006, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158.

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation and Nature of Operations

Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Pinnacle West and
our subsidiaries: APS, Pinnacle West Energy (dissolved as of August 31, 2006), APS Energy Services,
SunCor, El Dorado  and Pinnacle West Marketing & Trading. See Note 22 for a
discussion of the sale of NAC in November 2004. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions
between the consolidated companies have been eliminated.

APS is a vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale
electric service to substantially all of the state of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about
one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave County in
northwestern Arizona. APS Energy Services was formed in 1998 and provides competitive commodity
energy and energy-related products to key customers in competitive markets in the western United
States. SunCor is a developer of residential, commercial and industrial real estate projects in
Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho and Utah. El Dorado is an investment firm.

Accounting Records and Use of Estimates

Our accounting records are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Derivative Accounting

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity, natural gas and emissions allowances and in interest rates. We manage risks
associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various instruments that qualify as
derivatives, including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options
and swaps. As part of our overall risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge
purchases and sales of electricity, fuels, and emissions allowances and credits. In addition,
subject to specified risk parameters monitored by the ERMC, we engage in marketing and trading
activities intended to profit from market price movements.

We account for our derivative contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. SFAS No. 133 requires that entities
recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those
instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are either
recognized periodically in income or, if certain hedge criteria are met, in common stock equity (as
a component of other comprehensive income (loss)). To the extent the amounts that would otherwise
be recognized in income are eligible to be recovered through the PSA, the amounts will be recorded
as either a regulatory asset or liability and have no effect on earnings. SFAS No. 133 provides a
scope exception for contracts that meet the normal purchases and sales criteria specified in the
standard. Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for on an
accrual basis with



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted commodities are
delivered or received.

Under fair value (mark-to-market) accounting, derivative contracts for the purchase or sale of
energy commodities are reflected at fair market value, net of valuation adjustments, as current or
long-term assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

We determine fair market value using actively-quoted prices when available. We consider
quotes for exchange-traded contracts and over-the-counter quotes obtained from independent brokers
to be actively-quoted.

When actively-quoted prices are not available, we use prices provided by other external
sources. This includes quarterly and calendar year quotes from independent brokers, which we
convert into monthly prices using historical relationships.

For options, long-term contracts and other contracts for which price quotes are not available,
we use models and other valuation methods. The valuation models we employ utilize spot prices,
forward prices, historical market data and other factors to forecast future prices. The primary
valuation technique we use to calculate the fair value of contracts where price quotes are not
available is based on the extrapolation of forward pricing curves using observable market data for
more liquid delivery points in the same region and actual transactions at the more illiquid
delivery points. We also value option contracts using a variation of the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model.

For non-exchange traded contracts, we calculate fair market value based on the average of the
bid and offer price, discounted to reflect net present value. We maintain certain valuation
adjustments for a number of risks associated with the valuation of future commitments. These
include valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risks based on the financial condition of
counterparties. The liquidity valuation adjustment represents the cost that would be incurred if
all unmatched positions were closed-out or hedged.

The credit valuation adjustment represents estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to
counterparties, taking into account netting arrangements, expected default experience for the
credit rating of the counterparties and the overall diversification of the portfolio.
Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of major energy companies, municipalities,
local distribution companies and financial institutions. We maintain credit policies that
management believes minimize overall credit risk. Determination of the credit quality of
counterparties is based upon a number of factors, including credit ratings, financial condition,
project economics and collateral requirements. When applicable, we employ standardized agreements
that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single
counterparty.

The use of models and other valuation methods to determine fair market value often requires
subjective and complex judgment. Actual results could differ from the results estimated through
application of these methods. Our marketing and trading portfolio includes structured activities
hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales
transactions. Our practice is to hedge within timeframes established by the ERMC.

See Note 18 for additional information about our derivative and energy trading accounting
policies.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

See Note 2 for information about a new accounting standard on fair value measurements.

Regulatory Accounting

APS is regulated by the ACC and the FERC. The accompanying financial statements reflect the
rate-making policies of these commissions. For regulated operations, we prepare our financial
statements in accordance with SFAS No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation.” SFAS No. 71 requires a cost-based, rate-regulated enterprise to reflect the impact of
regulatory decisions in its financial statements. As a result, we capitalize certain costs that
would be included as expense in the current period by unregulated companies. Regulatory assets
represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in
customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already
been collected from customers.

Management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery
by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to
other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction. This determination reflects the current
political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future. If future
recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current
period earnings.

A major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power costs deferred under
the PSA. APS defers for future rate recovery 90% of the difference between actual retail fuel and
purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates.

Utility Plant and Depreciation

Utility plant is the term we use to describe the business property and equipment that supports
electric service, consisting primarily of generation, transmission and distribution facilities. We
report utility plant at its original cost, which includes:

We expense the costs of plant outages, major maintenance and routine maintenance as incurred.
We charge retired utility plant to accumulated depreciation. Liabilities associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets are recognized at fair value as incurred and capitalized
as part of the related tangible long-lived assets. Accretion of the liability due to the passage
of time is an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
long-lived asset. See Note 12.

APS records a regulatory liability for the asset retirement obligations related to its
regulated assets. This regulatory liability represents the difference between the amount that has
been recovered in regulated rates and the amount calculated under SFAS No. 143 “Accounting for
Asset Obligations,” as interpreted by FIN 47. APS believes it can recover in regulated rates the
costs calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 143.

We record depreciation on utility plant on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful
life of the related assets. The approximate remaining average useful lives of our utility property
at December 31, 2006 were as follows:



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the years 2004 through 2006, the depreciation rates ranged from a low of 1.18% to a high
of 11.43%. The weighted-average rate was 3.14 % for 2006, 3.0% for 2005 and 3.36% for 2004. We
depreciate non-utility property and equipment over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets, ranging from 3 to 34 years.

Investments

El Dorado accounts for its investments using the equity (if significant influence) and cost
(less than 20% ownership) methods. See Note 22 for a discussion of the sale of NAC.

The
Company’s investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund are reviewed in accordance with EITF 03-1, “The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.”
See Note 12 for information for more information in these investments.

Capitalized Interest

Capitalized interest represents the cost of debt funds used to finance non-regulated
construction projects. The rate used to calculate capitalized interest was a composite rate of
6.8% for 2006, 5.7% for 2005 and 4.9% for 2004. Capitalized interest ceases to accrue when
construction is complete.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

AFUDC represents the approximate net composite interest cost of borrowed funds and an allowed
return on the equity funds used for construction of regulated utility plant. APS’ allowance for
borrowed funds is included in capitalized interest on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Plant
construction costs, including AFUDC, are recovered in authorized rates through depreciation when
completed projects are placed into commercial operation.

AFUDC was calculated by using a composite rate of 8.0% for 2006, 7.7% for 2005 and 8.4% for
2004. APS compounds AFUDC monthly and ceases to accrue AFUDC when construction work is completed
and the property is placed in service.

Electric Revenues

We derive electric revenues from sales of electricity to our regulated Native Load customers
and sales to other parties from our marketing and trading activities. Revenues related to the sale
of electricity are generally recorded when service is rendered or electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination and billing of electricity sales to individual Native Load
customers is



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month.
At the end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers since the date of the last
meter reading and billing and the corresponding unbilled revenue are estimated. We exclude sales
taxes on electric revenues from both revenue and taxes other than income taxes. Beginning April
2005 in accordance with the order in the APS 2003 Rate Case, we exclude city franchise fees from
both electric revenues and operating expenses.

Revenues from our Native Load customers and non-derivative instruments are reported on a gross
basis on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income. In the electricity business, some
contracts to purchase energy are netted against other contracts to sell energy. This is called a
“book-out” and usually occurs for contracts that have the same terms (quantities and delivery
points) and for which power does not flow. We net these book-outs, which reduces both revenues and
purchased power and fuel costs.

All gains and losses (realized and unrealized) on energy trading contracts that qualify as
derivatives are included in marketing and trading revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income
on a net basis.

Real Estate Revenues

SunCor recognizes revenue from land, home and qualifying commercial operating assets sales in
full, provided (a) the income is determinable, that is, the collectibility of the sales price is
reasonably assured or the amount that will not be collectible can be estimated, and (b) the
earnings process is virtually complete, that is, SunCor is not obligated to perform significant
activities after the sale to earn the income. Unless both conditions exist, recognition of all or
part of the income is postponed under the percentage of completion method per SFAS No. 66,
“Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.” SunCor recognizes income only after the assets’ title has
passed. Commercial property and management revenues are recorded over the term of the lease or
period in which services are provided. In addition, see Note 22 – Discontinued Operations.

Real Estate Investments

Real estate investments primarily include SunCor’s land, residential inventory, commercial
property and investments in joint ventures. Land includes acquisition costs, infrastructure costs,
property taxes and capitalized interest directly associated with the acquisition and development of
each project. Land under development and land held for future development are stated at
accumulated cost, except that, to the extent that such land is believed to be impaired, it is
written down to fair value. Land held for sale is stated at the lower of accumulated cost or
estimated fair value less costs to sell. Residential inventory consists of construction costs,
improved lot costs, capitalized interest and property taxes on homes and condos under construction.
Residential inventory is stated at the lower of accumulated cost or estimated fair value less
costs to sell. Investments in joint ventures for which SunCor does not have a controlling
financial interest are not consolidated but are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. In addition, see Note 22 – Discontinued Operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at
acquisition to be cash equivalents.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We have investments in auction rate securities in which interest rates are reset on a
short-term basis; however, the underlying contract maturity dates extend beyond three months. We
classify the investments in auction rate securities as investment in debt securities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Nuclear Fuel

APS charges nuclear fuel to fuel expense by using the unit-of-production method. The
unit-of-production method is an amortization method based on actual physical usage. APS divides
the cost of the fuel by the estimated number of thermal units it expects to produce with that fuel.
APS then multiplies that rate by the number of thermal units produced within the current period.
This calculation determines the current period nuclear fuel expense.

APS also charges nuclear fuel expense for the interim storage and permanent disposal of spent
nuclear fuel. The DOE is responsible for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and it
charges APS $0.001 per kWh of nuclear generation. See Note 11 for information about spent nuclear
fuel disposal and Note 12 for information on nuclear decommissioning costs.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability approach prescribed by SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” We file our federal income tax return on a consolidated basis and
we file our state income tax returns on a consolidated or unitary basis. In accordance with our
intercompany tax sharing agreement, federal and state income taxes are allocated to each subsidiary
as though each subsidiary filed a separate income tax return. Any difference between that method
and the consolidated (and unitary) income tax liability is attributed to the parent company. The
income tax liability accounts reflect the tax and interest associated with management’s estimate of
the most probable resolution of all known and measurable tax
exposures. See Note 4. Also, see Note
2 for information regarding new accounting guidance on income taxes.

Reacquired Debt Costs

APS defers gains and losses incurred upon early retirement of debt. These costs are amortized
equally on a monthly basis over the remaining life of the original debt consistent with its
ratemaking treatment.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” using the
modified prospective application method. Because the fair value recognition provisions of both
SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 123(R) are materially consistent with respect to our stock-based
compensation plans, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.

In
2004, there was an immaterial difference between the stock
compensation expense recorded in net income and the proforma stock
compensation expense in accordance with SFAS No. 123.

Intangible Assets and Emission Allowance Inventory

We have no goodwill recorded and have separately disclosed other intangible assets, primarily
software, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with SFAS No.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” The intangible assets are amortized over their
finite useful lives. Amortization expense was $39 million in 2006, $33 million in 2005 and $34
million in 2004. Estimated amortization expense on existing intangible assets over the next five
years is $34 million in 2007, $20 million in 2008, $12 million in 2009, $10 million in 2010 and $5
million in 2011. At December 31, 2006, the weighted average remaining amortization period for
intangible assets is 3 years.

We account for our emission allowances at the lower of cost or market.

2. New Accounting Standards

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” This guidance requires us to recognize
the tax benefits of an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the benefit will
be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority. A tax position that meets the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold must be recognized in the financial statements at the
largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. The Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2006. We are currently evaluating this new guidance and believe it will not have a material impact
on  retained earnings.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” This guidance
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. The Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We
are currently evaluating this new guidance.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option
for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” SFAS No. 159
provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets
and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us on
January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of this
new standard.

See the following Notes for information about new accounting standards:

•

See Note 8 and Note S-6 for a discussion of SFAS No. 158 on pension and other postretirement
plans.

•

See Note 16 for a discussion of the accounting standard (SFAS No. 123(R)) on
stock-based compensation.

base rate for fuel and purchased power costs of $0.0325 per kWh based on estimated 2007 prices; and
(c) a capital structure of 45% long-term debt and 55% common stock equity, with a weighted-average
cost of capital of 8.73% (5.41% for long-term debt and 11.50% for common stock equity). If the ACC
approves the requested base rate increase for fuel and purchased power costs, subsequent PSA rate
adjustments and/or PSA surcharges would be reduced because more of such costs would be recovered in
base rates. See “Power Supply Adjustor” below.

APS has also suggested three additional measures for the ACC’s consideration to improve APS’
financial metrics while benefiting APS’ customers in the long run:

•

Allowing accelerated depreciation to address the large imbalance between
APS’ capital expenditures (estimated to average more than $900 million per year from
2007 through 2009) and its recovery of those expenses (in discussing this measure, APS
assumed an increase of $50 million per year in allowed depreciation expense, which
would increase APS’ revenue requirement by that same amount );

•

Placing generation and distribution construction work in progress
(“CWIP”) in rate base (in discussing this measure, APS assumed the inclusion of its
June 30, 2006 CWIP balance of $261 million in rate base, which would increase APS’
revenue requirement by about $33 million); and

•

Approving an “attrition adjustment” to provide APS a reasonable
opportunity to earn an authorized return on equity given overall cost increases and
higher levels of construction needed to accommodate ongoing customer growth (APS
suggested a minimum attrition adjustment that would increase the allowed return on
equity by 1.7% to 4.1%).

Residential Utility Consumer Office (“RUCO”), which the Arizona legislature established to
represent the interests of residential utility consumers before the ACC:

has also recommended that the ACC establish minimum three-year capacity factor targets for
Palo Verde based on a three-year average of Palo Verde performance as compared to a group
of comparable nuclear plants, with the ACC to review the recovery of any incremental fuel
and replacement power costs attributable to Palo Verde not meeting the minimum targets.

Other intervenors in the rate case include Arizonans for Electric Choice and Competition
(“AECC”), a business coalition that advocates on behalf of retail electric customers in Arizona;
and Phelps Dodge Mining Company (“Phelps Dodge”). In jointly-filed testimony, AECC and Phelps
Dodge recommended that the ACC reduce APS’ requested annual increase by at least $134 million.

Interim Rate Increase

On January 6, 2006, APS filed with the ACC an application requesting an emergency interim rate
increase of $299 million, or approximately 14%, to be effective April 1, 2006. APS later reduced
this request to $232 million, or approximately 11%, due to a decline in expected 2006 natural gas
and wholesale power prices. The purpose of the emergency interim rate increase was solely to
address APS’ under-collection of higher annual fuel and purchased power costs. On May 2, 2006, the
ACC approved an order in this matter that, among other things:

•

authorized an interim PSA adjustor, effective May 1, 2006, that resulted in an
interim retail rate increase of approximately 8.3% designed to recover approximately
$138 million of fuel and purchased power costs incurred in 2006 (this interim adjustor,
combined with the $15 million PSA surcharge approved by the ACC (see “Surcharge for
Certain 2005 PSA Deferrals” below), resulted in a rate increase of



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On December 8, 2006, the ACC approved APS’ request to continue the interim PSA adjustor until rates
become effective as a result of the general rate case.

Power Supply Adjustor

PSA Provisions

The PSA approved by the ACC in April 2005 as part of APS’ 2003 rate case provides for
adjustment of retail rates to reflect variations in retail fuel and purchased power costs. Such
adjustments are to be implemented by use of a PSA adjustor and PSA surcharges. On January 25,
2006, the ACC modified the PSA in certain respects. The PSA, as modified, is subject to specified
parameters and procedures, including the following:

•

APS records deferrals for recovery or refund to the extent actual retail fuel and
purchased power costs vary from the base fuel amount (currently $0.020743 per kWh);

•

the deferrals are subject to a 90/10 sharing arrangement in which APS must absorb
10% of the retail fuel and purchased power costs above the base fuel amount and may
retain 10% of the benefit from the retail fuel and purchased power costs that are below
the base fuel amount;

•

amounts to be recovered or refunded through the PSA adjustor are limited to (a) a
cumulative plus or minus $0.004 per kWh from the base fuel amount over the life of the
PSA and (b) a maximum plus or minus $0.004 change in the adjustor rate in any one year;

•

the recoverable amount of annual retail fuel and purchased power costs through
current base rates and the PSA was originally capped at $776.2 million; however, the



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ACC has removed the cap pending the ACC’s final ruling on APS’ pending request in
the general rate case to have the cap eliminated or substantially raised;

•

the adjustment is made annually each February 1

st

and goes into effect
automatically unless suspended by the ACC;

•

the PSA will remain in effect for a minimum five-year period, but the ACC may
eliminate the PSA at any time, if appropriate, in the event APS files a rate case
before the expiration of the five-year period (which APS did by filing the general rate
case noted above) or if APS does not comply with the terms of the PSA; and

•

APS is prohibited from requesting PSA surcharges until after the PSA annual adjustor
rate has been set each year. The amount available for potential PSA surcharges will be
limited to the amount of accumulated deferrals through the prior year-end, which are
not expected to be recovered through the annual adjustor or any PSA surcharges
previously approved by the ACC.

2007 PSA Annual Adjustor

The annual adjustor rate is set for twelve-month periods beginning
February 1 of each year. The current PSA annual adjustor rate was set at $0.003987 per kWh
effective February 1, 2007, down slightly from the maximum $0.004 annual adjustor rate effective
February 1, 2006. The new adjustor rate (a) essentially maintains the approximate 5% retail rate
increase that took effect February 1, 2006 as a result of the 2006 PSA Annual Adjustor and which
expired on February 1, 2007 and (b) is designed to recover approximately $109 million of deferred
fuel and purchased power costs over the twelve-month period that began February 1, 2007.

Surcharge for Certain 2005 PSA Deferrals

On April 12, 2006, the ACC approved APS’ request to
recover $15 million of 2005 PSA deferrals over a twelve-month period beginning May 2, 2006,
representing a temporary rate increase of approximately 0.7%. Approximately $45 million of 2005
PSA deferrals remain subject to a pending application (see “PSA Deferrals Related to Unplanned Palo
Verde Outages” below).

PSA Deferrals Related to Unplanned Palo Verde Outages

On February 2, 2006, APS filed with the
ACC an application to recover approximately $45 million over a twelve-month period, representing a
temporary rate increase of approximately 1.9%, proposed to begin no later than the ACC’s completion
of its inquiry regarding the unplanned 2005 Palo Verde outages. On August 17, 2006, the ACC staff
filed a report with the ACC recommending that the ACC disallow approximately $17.4 million ($10
million after income taxes) of the $45 million request. The report alleges that four of the eleven
Palo Verde outages in 2005 were “avoidable,” three of which resulted in the recommended
disallowance. The report also finds, among other things, that:

•

Three of the outages were due to “faulty or defective vendor supplied equipment” and
concludes that APS’ actions were not imprudent in connection with these outages. The
report recommends, however, that the ACC evaluate “the degree to which APS has sought
appropriate legal or other remedies” in connection with these outages and that APS “be
given the opportunity to demonstrate the steps that it has taken in this regard.”



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

•

“Additional investigation will be needed to determine the cause of and
responsibility for” the Palo Verde Unit 1 outage resulting from vibration levels in one
of the Unit’s shutdown cooling lines.

The report also recommends that the ACC establish minimum three-year capacity factor targets
for Palo Verde based on a three-year average of Palo Verde performance as compared to a group of
comparable nuclear plants, with the ACC to review the recovery of any incremental fuel and
replacement power costs attributable to Palo Verde not meeting the minimum targets.

APS disagrees with, and will contest, the report’s recommendation that the ACC disallow a
portion of the $45 million of PSA deferrals. Under ACC regulations, prudent investments are those
“which under ordinary circumstances would be deemed reasonable and not dishonest or obviously
wasteful” and “investments [are] presumed to have been prudently made, and such presumptions may be
set aside only by clear and convincing evidence that such investments were imprudent.” APS believes
the expenses in question were prudently incurred and, therefore, are recoverable. At the request
of the ACC staff, this matter is being addressed by the ACC as part of APS’ pending general rate
case.

As noted under “Interim Rate Increase” above, the ACC has directed the ACC staff to conduct a
“prudence audit” on unplanned 2006 Palo Verde outage costs. PSA deferrals related to these 2006
outages are estimated to be about $79 million through December 31, 2006. APS believes these
expenses were prudently incurred and, therefore, are recoverable.

Proposed Modifications to PSA (Requested In General Rate Case)

In its pending general rate case, APS has requested the following modifications to the PSA:

•

The cumulative plus or minus $0.004 per kWh limit from the base fuel amount over the
life of the PSA would be eliminated, while the maximum plus or minus $0.004 per kWh
limit to changes in the adjustor rate in any one year would remain in effect;

•

The $776.2 million annual limit on the retail fuel and purchased power costs under
APS’ current base rates and the PSA would be removed or increased (although APS may
defer fuel and purchased power costs above $776.2 million per year pending the ACC’s
final ruling on APS’ pending request to have the cap eliminated or substantially
raised);

•

The current provision that APS is required to file a surcharge application with the
ACC after accumulated pretax PSA deferrals equal $50 million and before they equal $100
million would be eliminated, thereby giving APS flexibility in determining when a
surcharge filing should be made; and

•

The costs of renewable energy and capacity costs attributable to purchased power
obtained through competitive procurement would be excluded from the existing 90/10
sharing arrangement under which APS absorbs 10% of the retail fuel and purchased power
costs above the base fuel amount and retains 10% of the benefit from retail fuel and
purchased power costs that are below the base fuel amount.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The ACC staff has recommended the following potential changes to the PSA:

•

Establishing the PSA annual adjustor, beginning in 2007, based on projected fuel
costs rather than historical fuel costs; and

•

Removing all existing limitations on fuel cost recovery, including the 90/10 sharing
arrangement.

Equity Infusions

On November 8, 2005, the ACC approved Pinnacle West’s request to infuse more than $450 million
of equity into APS during 2005 or 2006. These infusions consisted of about $250 million of the
proceeds of Pinnacle West’s common equity issuance on May 2, 2005 and about $210 million of the
proceeds from the sale of Silverhawk in January 2006.

Federal

In July 2002, the FERC adopted a price mitigation plan that constrains the price of
electricity in the wholesale spot electricity market in the western United States. The FERC
adopted a price cap of $250 per MWh for the period subsequent to October 31, 2002. Sales at prices
above the cap must be justified and are subject to potential refund.

4. Income Taxes

Certain assets and liabilities are reported differently for income tax purposes than they are
for financial statements purposes. The tax effect of these differences is recorded as deferred
taxes. We calculate deferred taxes using the current income tax rates.

APS has recorded a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability related to income taxes on its
Balance Sheets in accordance with SFAS No. 71. The regulatory asset is for certain temporary
differences, primarily the allowance for equity funds used during construction. The regulatory
liability relates to excess deferred taxes resulting primarily from the reduction in federal income
tax rates as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. APS amortizes this amount as the differences
reverse.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As a result of a change in IRS guidance, we claimed a tax deduction related to an APS tax
accounting method change on the 2001 federal consolidated income tax return. The accelerated
deduction resulted in a $200 million reduction in the current income tax liability and a
corresponding increase in the plant-related deferred tax liability. The 2001 federal consolidated
income tax return is currently under examination by the IRS. As part of this ongoing examination,
the IRS is reviewing this accounting method change and the resultant deduction. During 2004 and
again in 2005, the current income tax liability was increased, with a corresponding decrease to
plant-related deferred tax liability, to reflect the expected outcome of this audit. We do not
expect the ultimate outcome of this examination to have a material adverse impact on our financial
position or results of operations. We expect that it will have a negative impact on cash flows.

See Note 2 for a discussion of a new accounting standard related to uncertain tax positions.

In 2006 and 2004, we resolved certain prior-year issues with the taxing authorities and
recorded tax benefits associated with tax credits and other reductions to income tax expense.

31, 2005, which were available either to support the issuance of up to $250 million in commercial
paper or to be used for bank borrowings, including issuance of letters of credit. The current line
terminates in December 2010. Pinnacle West had no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2006 and
December 31, 2005. Pinnacle West had approximately $4 million of letters of credit issued under
the line at December 31, 2006 and approximately $11 million of letters of credit issued under the
line at December 31, 2005 ($7 million of which terminated as a result of the sale of Silverhawk –
see Note 22). The commitment fees were 0.15% in 2006 and 2005. Pinnacle West had commercial paper
borrowings of $28 million outstanding at December 31, 2006 and none at December 31, 2005. All
Pinnacle West and APS bank lines of credit and commercial paper agreements are unsecured.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APS had two committed lines of credit with various banks totaling $900 million at December 31,
2006 and one committed line of credit of $400 million at
December 31, 2005, all of which were
available either to support the issuance of up to $250 million in commercial paper or to be used
for bank borrowings, including the issuance of letters of credit. The $400 million line terminates
in December 2010 and the $500 million line terminates in September 2011. APS may increase the $500
million line to $600 million if certain conditions are met. The commitment fees for these lines of
credit were 0.10% and 0.11% at December 31, 2006 and 0.11% at December 31, 2005. APS had no bank
borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2006 and 2005. APS had
approximately $4 million of letters of credit issued under the $400 million line at December 31,
2006.

APS had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005. By Arizona
statute, APS’ short-term borrowings cannot exceed 7% of its total capitalization unless approved by
the ACC.

SunCor had revolving lines of credit totaling $170 million at December 31, 2006 maturing in
October 2008 and December 2008, and $150 million at December 31, 2005. The commitment fees were
0.125% in 2006 and 2005 for the $150 million line of credit. The commitment fees for the $20
million line of credit were 0.50% in 2006. SunCor had $118 million outstanding at December 31,
2006 and $123 million outstanding at December 31, 2005. The weighted-average interest rate was
7.09% at December 31, 2006 and 5.93% at December 31, 2005. Interest was based on LIBOR plus 2.0%
for 2006 and LIBOR plus 1.5% for 2005. The balance is included in long-term debt on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005. SunCor had other short-term loans in
the amount of $8 million at December 31, 2006 and $16 million at December 31, 2005. These loans
are made up of multiple notes primarily with variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus 2.5% at
December 31, 2006 and LIBOR plus 2.25% and 2.50% or prime plus 1.75% at December 31, 2005.

SunCor had $118 million outstanding at December 31, 2006 under its revolving line of credit.
The weighted-average interest rate was 7.08% at December 31, 2006. The remaining amount of
approximately $62 million at December 31, 2006 was made up of multiple notes with variable
interest rates based on the lenders’ prime rates plus 1.75% and 2.0% or LIBOR plus 2.25%.
There is also a note at a fixed rate of 4.25%. SunCor had $123 million outstanding at
December 31, 2005 under its revolving line of credit. The weighted-average interest rate was
5.93% at December 31, 2005. The remaining amount of approximately $6 million at December 31,
2005 was made up of multiple notes with variable interest rates based on the lenders’ prime

On April 3, 2006 Pinnacle West repaid $300 million of its 6.40% senior notes. Pinnacle West
used proceeds from the issuance of its $175 million 5.91% senior notes issued on February 28,
2006, and commercial paper to repay the notes.

(h)

On February 28, 2006, Pinnacle West entered into a $200 million Senior Notes Uncommitted
Master Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management Inc. (“Prudential”). Under the
terms of the agreement, Pinnacle West may offer up to $200 million of its senior notes for
purchase by Prudential at any time prior to December 31, 2007. The maturity of the notes
cannot exceed five years. On February 28, 2006, Pinnacle West issued $175 million of its
5.91% senior notes, series A, to Prudential. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay its
$300 million debt (see note f).

Pinnacle West’s and APS’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing
arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios. Certain of APS’ bank financing arrangements
also include an interest coverage test. Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants and each
anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements. For both
Pinnacle West and APS, these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total
consolidated capitalization cannot exceed 65%. At December 31, 2006, the ratio was approximately
48% for Pinnacle West and 46% for APS. The provisions regarding interest coverage require a
minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for APS. The interest coverage was
approximately 4.7 times under APS’ bank financing agreements as of December 31, 2006. Failure to
comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking,
would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross-default
other debt. See further discussion of “cross-default” provisions below.

Neither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’ financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would
result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating
downgrade. However, in the event of a rating downgrade, Pinnacle West and/or APS may be subject to
increased interest costs under certain financing agreements.

All of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in
defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or
APS were to default under certain other material agreements. All of APS’ bank agreements contain
cross-default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment
under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.
Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings.

On May 2, 2005, Pinnacle West issued 6,095,000 shares of its common stock at an
offering price of $42 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $248
million. Pinnacle West used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including
making capital contributions to APS, which, in turn, used such funds to pay a portion
of the approximately $190 million purchase price to acquire the Sundance Plant and for
other capital expenditures incurred to meet the growing needs of APS’ service
territory.

8. Retirement Plans and Other Benefits

Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a
non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and
its subsidiaries. All new employees participate in the account balance plan. A defined benefit
plan specifies the amount of benefits a plan participant is to receive using information about the
participant. The pension plan covers nearly all employees. The supplemental excess benefit
retirement plan covers officers of the Company and highly compensated employees designated for
participation by the Board of Directors. Our employees do not contribute to the plans. Generally,
we calculate the benefits based on age, years of service and pay.

We also sponsor other postretirement benefits for the employees of Pinnacle West and our
subsidiaries. We provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees. Employees must
retire to become eligible for these retirement benefits, which are based on years of service and
age. For the medical insurance plans, retirees make contributions to cover a portion of the plan
costs. For the life insurance plan, retirees do not make contributions. We retain the right to
change or eliminate these benefits.

Pinnacle West uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement
benefit plans. The market-related value of our plan assets is their fair value at the measurement
date.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.” This guidance requires us to recognize the underfunded
positions of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans on our December 31, 2006 balance
sheet. The guidance requires that the offset be reported in other comprehensive income, net of
tax; however, because the obligations relate primarily to APS’ regulated operations, the increase
in liabilities related to APS’ share is offset by regulatory assets. The following tables provide
details of the effects of implementing SFAS Statement No. 158 (dollars in thousands):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In selecting the pretax expected long-term rate of return on plan assets we consider past
performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan. For the year
2007, we are assuming a 9% long-term rate of return on plan assets, which we believe is reasonable
given our asset allocation in relation to historical and expected performance.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the
health care plans. A one percentage point change in the assumed initial and ultimate health care
cost trend rates would have the following effects (dollars in millions):

The Board of Directors has delegated oversight of the plan assets to an Investment Management

by maximizing return consistent with acceptable levels of risk. The primary investment strategies
are diversification of assets, stated asset allocation targets and ranges, prohibition of
investments in Pinnacle West securities, and external management of plan assets.

Pinnacle West’s other postretirement benefit plans’ asset allocation at December 31, 2006 and
2005, is as follows:

Employee Savings Plan Benefits

Pinnacle West sponsors a defined contribution savings plan for eligible employees of Pinnacle
West and its subsidiaries. In 2006, costs related to APS’ employees represented 97% of the total
cost of this plan. In a defined contribution savings plan, the benefits a participant receives
result from regular contributions participants make to their own individual account, the Company’s
matching contributions and earnings or losses on their investments. Under this plan, the Company
matches a percentage of the participants’ contributions in the form of Pinnacle West stock.
Participants have an option to transfer the Company matching contributions out of the Pinnacle West
Stock Fund to other investment funds within the plan. At December 31, 2006, approximately 20% of
total plan assets were in Pinnacle West stock. Pinnacle West recorded expenses for this plan of
approximately $6 million for 2006, $6 million for 2005 and $5 million for 2004. APS recorded
expenses for this plan of approximately $6 million in 2006, $6 million in 2005 and $5 million in
2004.

9. Leases

In 1986, APS sold about 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain common facilities in
three separate sale leaseback transactions. APS accounts for these leases as operating leases.
The gain resulting from the transaction of approximately $140 million was deferred and is being
amortized to operations and maintenance expense over 29.5 years, the original term of the leases.
There are options to renew the leases and to purchase the property for fair market value at the end
of the lease terms. Rent expense is calculated on a straight-line basis. See Note 20 for a
discussion of VIEs, including the VIE’s involved in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions.

In addition, we lease certain land, buildings, equipment, vehicles and miscellaneous other
items through operating rental agreements with varying terms, provisions and expiration dates.

Total lease expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $72 million in
2006, $71 million in 2005 and $69 million in 2004. APS’ lease expense was $64 million in 2006, $58
million in 2005 and $57 million in 2004.

The amounts to be paid for the Palo Verde Unit 2 leases are approximately $49 million per year
for the years 2007 to 2015.

Estimated future minimum lease payments for Pinnacle West’s and APS’ operating leases are
approximately as follows (dollars in millions):

Policy Act required the DOE to develop a permanent repository for the storage and disposal of spent
nuclear fuel by 1998, the DOE has announced that the repository cannot be completed before at least
2017. In November 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
(D.C. Circuit) issued a decision preventing the DOE from excusing its own delay, but refused to
order the DOE to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel. Based on this decision and the DOE’s delay, a
number of utilities, including APS (on behalf of itself and the other Palo Verde owners), filed
damages actions against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. APS is currently pursuing that
damages claim.

APS currently estimates it will incur $147 million (in 2006 dollars) over the life of Palo
Verde for its share of the costs related to the on-site interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. At
December 31, 2006, APS had a regulatory liability of $1 million that represents amounts recovered
in retail rates in excess of amounts spent for on-site interim spent fuel storage.

NRC Inspection

In October 2006, the NRC conducted an inspection of the Palo Verde emergency diesel generators
after a Palo Verde Unit 3 generator started but did not provide electrical output during routine
inspections on July 25 and September 22, 2006.

On February 22, 2007, the NRC issued a “white” finding (low to moderate safety
significance) for this matter. In connection with its finding, the NRC stated that it
would “use the NRC Action Matrix to determine the most appropriate response and
any increase in NRC oversight, or actions [APS needs] to take in response to the most
recent performance deficiencies” and notify APS of its determination at a later date.
Under the NRC’s Action Matrix, this finding, coupled with a previous NRC “yellow”
finding relating to a 2004 matter involving Palo Verde’s safety injection systems, will
place one or more Palo Verde units in the “multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone”
column of the NRC’s Action Matrix, which will result in an enhanced NRC
inspection regimen. APS continues to implement its plan to improve
Palo Verde’s
operational performance.

Nuclear Insurance

The Palo Verde participants have insurance for public liability resulting from nuclear energy
hazards to the full limit of liability under federal law. This potential liability is covered by
primary liability insurance provided by commercial insurance carriers in the amount of $300 million
and the balance by an industry-wide retrospective assessment program. If losses at any nuclear
power plant covered by the program exceed the accumulated funds, APS could be assessed
retrospective premium adjustments. The maximum assessment per reactor under the program for each
nuclear incident is approximately $101 million, subject to an annual limit of $15 million per
incident, to be periodically adjusted for inflation. Based on APS’ interest in the three Palo
Verde units, APS’ maximum potential assessment per incident for all three units is approximately
$88 million, with an annual payment limitation of approximately $13 million.

The Palo Verde participants maintain “all risk” (including nuclear hazards) insurance for
property damage to, and decontamination of, property at Palo Verde in the aggregate amount of $2.75
billion, a substantial portion of which must first be applied to stabilization and decontamination.
APS has also secured insurance against portions of any increased cost of generation or purchased
power and business interruption resulting from a sudden and unforeseen accidental outage of any of
the three units. The property damage, decontamination, and replacement power coverages are
provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL). APS is subject to retrospective assessments
under all NEIL policies if NEIL’s losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds. The maximum
amount of retrospective assessments APS could incur under the current NEIL policies totals $18.1
million. The insurance coverage discussed in this and the previous paragraph is subject to certain
policy conditions and exclusions.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

Pinnacle West and APS are parties to various fuel and purchased power contracts with terms
expiring between 2007 and 2025 that include required purchase provisions. Pinnacle West estimates
the contract requirements to be approximately $366 million in 2007; $259 million in 2008; $241
million in 2009; $221 million in 2010; $191 million in
2011; and $1.3 billion thereafter. APS
estimates the contract requirements to be approximately $306 million in 2007; $231 million in 2008;
$241 million in 2009; $221 million in 2010;
$185 million in 2011; and $1.3 billion thereafter.
However, these amounts may vary significantly pursuant to certain provisions in such contracts that
permit us to decrease required purchases under certain circumstances.

Of the various fuel and purchased power contracts mentioned above some of those contracts have
take-or-pay provisions. The contracts APS has for the supply of its coal supply have take-or-pay
provisions. The current take-or-pay coal contracts have terms that expire in 2024.

California Energy Market Issues and Refunds in the Pacific Northwest

FERC

In July 2001, the FERC ordered an expedited fact-finding hearing to calculate refunds for spot
market transactions in California during a specified time frame. APS was a seller and a purchaser
in the California markets at issue, and to the extent that refunds are ordered, APS should be a
recipient as well as a payor of such amounts. The FERC is still considering the evidence and
refund amounts have not yet been finalized. However, on September 6, 2005, the Ninth Circuit
issued a decision, concluding that the FERC may not order refunds from entities that are not within
the FERC’s jurisdiction. Because a number of the entities owing refunds under the FERC’s
calculations are not within the FERC’s jurisdiction, this order may affect the level of recovery of
refunds due in this proceeding. In addition, on August 8, 2005, the FERC issued an order allowing
sellers in the California markets to demonstrate that its refund methodology results in an overall
revenue shortfall for their transactions in the relevant markets over a specified time frame. More
than twenty sellers made such cost recovery filings on September 14, 2005. On January 26, 2006,
the FERC conditionally accepted thirteen of these filings, reducing the refund liability for these
sellers. Correspondingly, this will reduce the recovery of total refunds in the California
markets. On August 2, 2006, the Ninth Circuit issued a decision on the appropriate temporal scope
and the type of transactions that are properly subject to the refund orders. In the decision, the
Court preserved the scope of the FERC’s existing refund proceedings, but also expanded it
potentially to include additional transactions, remanding the orders to the FERC for further
proceedings. Petitions for rehearing on this order are due no later than February 28, 2007. In
addition, on December 19, 2006, the Ninth Circuit issued a decision on the appropriate standard of
review at the FERC on wholesale power contracts in the refund proceedings, specifically addressing
the application of the so-called “just and reasonable” standard as opposed to the “public interest”
standard. In so doing, the Ninth Circuit remanded the matter back to the FERC with the requirement
that the FERC review the refund matter using the appropriate standard of review. Like the August 2,
2006 Ninth Circuit decision, the December 19, 2006 decision has the potential to expand the
existing FERC refund proceedings. We currently believe the refund claims at FERC will have no
material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flow or liquidity.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 19, 2002, the State of California filed a complaint with the FERC alleging that
wholesale sellers of power and energy, including the Company, failed to properly file rate
information at the FERC in connection with sales to California from 2000 to the present under
market-based rates. The complaint requests the FERC to require the wholesale sellers to refund any
rates that are “found to exceed just and reasonable levels.” This complaint was dismissed by the
FERC and the State of California appealed the matter to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In an
order issued September 9, 2004, the Ninth Circuit upheld the FERC’s authority to permit
market-based rates, but rejected the FERC’s claim that it was without authority to consider
retroactive refunds when a utility has not strictly adhered to the quarterly reporting requirements
of the market-based rate system. On September 9, 2004, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the
FERC for further proceedings. Several of the intervenors in this appeal filed a petition for
rehearing of this decision on October 25, 2004. The petition for rehearing was denied on July 31,
2006. On October 10, 2006, the State of California filed a motion to stay the issuance of the
mandate (scheduled to be issued on November 2, 2006) until March 2, 2007. The request for stay was
granted. The outcome of the further proceedings cannot be predicted at this time.

The FERC also ordered an evidentiary proceeding to discuss and evaluate possible refunds for
wholesale sales in the Pacific Northwest. The FERC affirmed the ALJ’s conclusion that the prices
in the Pacific Northwest were not unreasonable or unjust and refunds should not be ordered in this
proceeding. This decision has now been appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and oral
argument was held on January 8, 2007. Although the FERC ruling in this matter is being appealed
and the FERC has not yet calculated the specific refund amounts due in California, we do not expect
that the resolution of these issues, as to the amounts alleged in the proceedings, will have a
material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On March 26, 2003, the FERC made public a Final Report on Price Manipulation in Western
Markets, prepared by its staff and covering spot markets in the West in 2000 and 2001. The report
stated that a significant number of entities who participated in the California markets during the
2000-2001 time period, including APS, may potentially have been involved in arbitrage transactions
that allegedly violated certain provisions of the Independent System Operator tariff. After
reviewing the matter, along with the data supplied by APS, the FERC staff moved to dismiss the
claims against APS and to dismiss the proceeding. The motion to dismiss was granted by the FERC on
January 22, 2004. Certain parties have sought rehearing of this order, and that request is
pending.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On July 9, 2003, the FERC issued an order that altered the capacity rights of parties to the
1996 settlement but maintained the cost responsibility provisions agreed to by parties to that
settlement. On December 28, 2004, the D.C. Court of Appeals upheld the FERC’s authority to alter
the capacity rights of parties to the settlement. With respect to the FERC’s authority to maintain
the cost responsibility provisions of the settlement, a party has sought appellate review and is
seeking to reallocate the cost responsibility associated with the changed contractual obligations
in a way that would be less favorable to APS than under the FERC’s July 9, 2003 order. Should this
party prevail on this point, APS’ annual capacity cost could be increased by approximately $3
million per year after income taxes for the period September 2003 through December 2005. This
appeal had been stayed pending further consideration by the FERC. On May 26, 2006, the FERC issued
an Order on Remand affirming its earlier decision that there is no basis for modifying the
settlement rates during the remaining term of the settlement. The party seeking appellate review
is continuing to pursue an appeal of this issue and has therefore sought rehearing of the May 26,
2006 order. FERC’s next status report is due to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals by May 2, 2007.

Navajo Nation Litigation

In June 1999, the Navajo Nation served Salt River Project with a lawsuit filed in the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia (the “D.C. Lawsuit”) naming Salt River Project,
several Peabody Coal Company entities (collectively, “Peabody”), Southern California Edison Company
and other defendants, and citing various claims in connection with the renegotiations of the coal
royalty and lease agreements under which Peabody mines coal for the Navajo Generating Station and
the Mohave Generating Station. APS is a 14% owner of the Navajo Generating Station, which Salt
River Project operates. The D.C. Lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants obtained
a favorable coal royalty rate by improperly influencing the outcome of a federal administrative
process under which the royalty rate was to be adjusted. The suit seeks $600 million in damages,
treble damages, punitive damages of not less than $1 billion, and the ejection of defendants “from
all possessory interests and Navajo Tribal lands arising out of the [primary coal lease].” In July
2001, the court dismissed all claims against Salt River Project.

In January, 2005, Peabody served APS with a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court for the City of
St. Louis naming APS and the other Navajo Generating Station participants and seeking, among other
things, a declaration that the participants “are obligated to reimburse Peabody for any royalty,
tax, or other obligation arising out of the D.C. Lawsuit.” Based on APS’ ownership interest in the
Navajo Generating Station, APS could be liable for up to 14% of any such obligation. Because the
litigation is in preliminary stages, APS cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter.

Superfund

Superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating
the soil, water or air. Those who generated, transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a
contaminated site are among those who are PRPs. PRPs may be strictly, and often jointly and
severally, liable for clean-up. On September 3, 2003, the EPA advised APS that the EPA considers
APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52

nd

Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 (OU3) in
Phoenix, Arizona. APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site. APS and Pinnacle West
have agreed with the EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within
OU3. Because the investigation has not yet been completed and ultimate remediation requirements
are not yet finalized, neither APS nor Pinnacle West can currently estimate the expenditures which
may be required.

Litigation

We are party to various other claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary
course of business, including but not limited to environmental matters related to the Clean Air
Act, Navajo Nation issues and EPA and ADEQ issues. In our opinion, the ultimate resolution of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or
liquidity.

12. Asset Retirement Obligations

APS has asset retirement obligations for its Palo Verde nuclear facilities and certain other
generation, transmission and distribution assets. The Palo Verde asset retirement obligation
primarily relates to final plant decommissioning. This obligation is based on the NRC’s
requirements for disposal of radiated property or plant and agreements APS reached with the ACC for
final decommissioning of the plant. The non-nuclear generation asset retirement obligations
primarily relate to requirements for removing portions of those plants at the end of the plant life
or lease term.

Some of APS’ transmission and distribution assets have asset retirement obligations because
they are subject to right of way and easement agreements that require final removal. These
agreements have a history of uninterrupted renewal that APS expects to continue. As a result, APS
cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the asset retirement obligation related to such
distribution and transmission assets.

Additionally, APS has aquifer protection permits for some of its generation sites that require
the closure of certain facilities at those sites. The generation sites are strategically located
to serve APS Native Load customers. Management expects to continuously use the sites and, thus,
cannot estimate a potential closure date. The asset retirement obligations associated with our
non-regulated assets are immaterial.

The following schedule shows the change in our asset retirement obligations for 2006 and 2005

In accordance with SFAS No. 71, APS accrues removal costs for its regulated utility assets,
even if there is no legal obligation for removal. See detail of regulatory liabilities in Note 1.

To fund the costs APS expects to incur to decommission Palo Verde, APS established external
decommissioning trusts in accordance with NRC regulations. APS invests the trust funds in fixed
income securities and domestic equity securities. APS applies the provisions of SFAS No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” in accounting for investments
in decommissioning trust funds, and classifies these investments as available for sale. As a
result, we

record the decommissioning trust funds at their fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

14. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We believe that the carrying amounts of our cash equivalents are reasonable estimates of their
fair values at December 31, 2006 and 2005 due to their short maturities.

We hold investments in fixed income securities for purposes other than trading. We believe
that the carrying amounts of these investments represent reasonable estimates of their fair values
at December 31, 2006 and 2005 due to the short-term reset of interest rates.

We also hold investments in fixed income and domestic equity securities for purposes other
than trading. The December 31, 2006 and 2005 fair values of such investments, which we determine
by using quoted market prices, approximate their carrying amount. For further information, see
disclosure of cost and fair value of APS’ nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets in Note 12.

On December 31, 2006, the carrying value of our long-term debt for Pinnacle West, excluding
capitalized lease obligations was $3.23 billion, with an estimated fair value of $3.19 billion.
The carrying value of our long-term debt for Pinnacle West excluding capitalized lease obligations
and interest rate swaps was $2.99 billion on December 31, 2005, with an estimated fair value of

16. Stock-Based Compensation

Pinnacle West offers stock-based compensation plans for officers and key employees of Pinnacle
West and our subsidiaries.

The 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2002 Plan”) allows Pinnacle West to grant performance
shares, stock ownership incentive awards and non-qualified and performance-accelerated stock
options to key employees. We have reserved 6 million shares of common stock for issuance under the
2002 plan. No more than 1.8 million shares may be issued in relation to performance share awards
and stock ownership incentive awards. The plan also provides for the granting of new non-qualified
stock options at a price per share not less than the fair market value of the common stock at the
time of grant. All options are now vested. The terms
of the options cannot be longer than 10 years and the options cannot be repriced during their
terms.

Performance
share awards under the 2002 Plan contain performance criteria that
affect the number of shares that ultimately vest. Generally, each recipient of performance shares is entitled to
receive shares of common stock at the end of a three-year performance period. The number of shares
each recipient ultimately receives, if any, is based upon the relative percentile ranking of
Pinnacle West’s earnings per share growth rate at the end of the three-year period as compared to
the earnings per share growth rate of all relevant companies in a specified utilities index. The
fair value of the grant is estimated using the Company’s closing stock
price on the date of grant. Management evaluates the
probability of meeting the performance criteria at each balance sheet
date. If the goals are
not achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any recognized compensation cost is reversed.

The 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“1994 Plan”) includes outstanding options but no new awards
may be granted under the plan. Options vested one-third of the grant per year beginning one year
after the date the option is granted and expire ten years from the date of the grant. The 1994
Plan also provided for the granting of any combination of shares of restricted stock, stock
appreciation rights or dividend equivalents.

In 2006, Retention Unit Awards (“Retention Units”) were granted to key employees. Each
Retention Unit represents the right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of one
share of Pinnacle West’s common stock, determined on pre-established valuation dates. One-fourth
of the Retention Units will be redeemed the first business day of calendar years 2007, 2008, 2009
and 2010. In addition, the employee will receive the amount of dividends that the employee would
have received if the employee had owned the stock from the date of grant to the date of payment
plus interest. The Retention Units vest over a four year period from 2006 through 2009, unless the
employee is eligible to retire, in which case the employee’s Retention Units are immediately vested
and the compensation expense is recognized. As this award is accounted for as a liability award,
 compensation costs, initially measured based on the Company’s
stock price on the grant date, is remeasured at each balance sheet date.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” using the
modified prospective application method. Because the fair value recognition provisions of both
SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 123(R) are materially consistent with respect to our stock-based
compensation plans, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.

The compensation cost that has been charged against Pinnacle West’s income for share-based
compensation plans was $13 million in 2006, $6 million in 2005 and $8 million in 2004. The
compensation cost that Pinnacle West has capitalized was immaterial in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

tax deductions from option exercises of the share-based payment arrangements was $2 million for
2006, $1 million for 2005 and $1 million for 2004.

Pinnacle West’s current policy is to issue new shares to satisfy share requirements for stock
compensation plans and it does not expect to repurchase any shares during 2007.

17. Business Segments

Pinnacle West’s two principal business segments are:

•

our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail
and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electricity service to Native Load
customers) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission and
distribution; and

•

our real estate segment, which consists of SunCor’s real estate development and
investment activities.

Our reportable business segments reflect a change from the previously reported information.
As of December 31, 2006, our marketing and trading activities are no longer considered a segment
requiring separate reporting or disclosure. The marketing and trading activities consist of our
competitive energy business, including wholesale marketing and trading and retail commodity-related
energy services. These activities have decreased as a result of fewer market opportunities and the
Company’s intention to deemphasize that part of our business. These activities are now reported

18. Derivative and Energy Trading Accounting

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity, natural gas, coal, emissions allowances and in interest rates. We manage
risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various instruments that qualify as
derivatives, including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options
and swaps. As part of our overall risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge
purchases and sales of electricity, fuels, and emissions allowances and credits. As of December
31, 2006, we hedged certain exposures to the price variability of commodities for a maximum of 3.25
years. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in
the hedged transactions. In addition, subject to specified risk parameters monitored by the ERMC,
we engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price movements.

We recognize all derivatives, except those which qualify for a scope exception, as either
assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value in
accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 149. Derivative commodity contracts for the
physical delivery of purchase and sale quantities transacted in the normal course of business
qualify for the normal purchase and sales exception and are accounted for under the accrual method
of accounting. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized periodically in
income unless certain hedge criteria are met. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in common stock equity (as a component
of other comprehensive income (loss)). For fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative
as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item associated with the hedged risk are
recognized in earnings. We use cash flow hedges to limit our exposure to cash flow variability on
forecasted transactions. We use fair value hedges to limit our exposure to changes in fair value
of an asset or liability.

For its regulated operations, APS defers for future rate recovery 90% of gains and losses on
derivatives that would otherwise be recognized in income. In the following discussion amounts that
would otherwise be recognized in income will be recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability
and have no effect on earnings to the extent these amounts are eligible to be recovered through the
PSA.

We assess hedge effectiveness both at inception and on a continuing basis. Hedge
effectiveness is related to the degree to which the derivative contract and the hedged item are
correlated and measured based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract
and the hedged item over time. We exclude the time value of certain options from our assessment of
hedge effectiveness. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, or the amount by
which the derivative contract and the hedged commodity are not directly correlated, is recognized
immediately in net income.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Both non-trading and trading derivatives that do not qualify for a scope exception are
classified as assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain of our non-trading derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge
accounting treatment. Non-trading derivatives, or any portion thereof that are not effective
hedges, are adjusted to fair value through income. Realized gains and losses related to
non-trading derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges of expected transactions are recognized in
revenue or purchased power and fuel expense as an offset to the related item being hedged when the
underlying hedged physical transaction impacts earnings. If it becomes probable that a forecasted
transaction will not occur, we discontinue the use of hedge accounting and recognize in income the
unrealized gains and losses that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). In
the event a non-trading derivative is terminated or settled, the unrealized gains and losses remain
in other comprehensive income (loss), and are recognized in income when the underlying transaction
impacts earnings.

All gains and losses (realized and unrealized) on trading contracts that qualify as
derivatives are included in marketing and trading revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income
on a net basis. Trading contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative are accounted
for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted
commodities are delivered or received.

In the electricity business, some contracts to purchase energy are netted against other
contracts to sell energy. This is called “book-out” and usually occurs in contracts that have the
same terms (quantities and delivery points) and for which power does not flow. We net these
book-outs, which reduces both revenues and fuel and purchased power costs in our Consolidated
Statement of Income, but this does not impact our financial condition, net income or cash flows.

Cash Flow Hedges

The changes in the fair value of our hedged positions included in the Consolidated Statements
of Income, after consideration of amounts deferred under the PSA, for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):




Gains (losses) on the ineffective portion
of derivatives qualifying for hedge
accounting

(1,568

Gains (losses) from the change in options’

(10

)



Gains from the discontinuance of
cash flow hedges



1,137

During 2007, we estimate that a net gain of $34 million before income taxes will be
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income as an offset to the effect of market price
changes for the related hedged transactions. To the extent the amounts are eligible for inclusion
in the PSA, the amounts will be recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability and have no
effect on earnings (see Note 3).

We maintain a margin account with a broker to support our risk management and trading
activities. The margin account was an asset of $73 million at December 31, 2006 and a liability of
$123 million at December 31, 2005 and is included in the margin account in the table above. Cash
is deposited with the broker in this account at the time futures or options contracts are
initiated. The change in market value of these contracts (reflected in mark-to-market) requires
adjustment of the margin account balance.

Cash or other assets may be required to serve as collateral against our open positions on
certain energy-related contracts. Collateral provided to counterparties was $10 million at
December 31, 2006 and $6 million at December 31, 2005, and is included in other current assets on



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Collateral provided to us by counterparties was $54 million at
December 31, 2006 and $216 million at December 31, 2005, and is included in other current
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Credit Risk

We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties. We
have risk management and trading contracts with many counterparties. Our risk management process
assesses and monitors the financial exposure of all counterparties. Despite the fact that the
great majority of trading counterparties’ securities are rated as investment grade by the credit
rating agencies, there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default,
resulting in a material impact on consolidated earnings for a given period. Counterparties in the
portfolio consist principally of financial institutions, major energy companies, municipalities and
local distribution companies. We maintain credit policies that we believe minimize overall credit
risk to within acceptable limits. Determination of the credit quality of our counterparties is
based upon a number of factors, including credit ratings and our evaluation of their financial
condition. To manage credit risk, we employ collateral requirements, standardized agreements that
allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and
credit default swaps. Valuation adjustments are established representing our estimated credit
losses on our overall exposure to counterparties. See Note 1 “Derivative Accounting” for a
discussion of our credit valuation adjustment policy.

20. Variable-Interest Entities

In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate VIE lessors in order to sell and
lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2. The leases are accounted for as operating leases in
accordance with GAAP. See Note 9 for further information about the sale leaseback transactions.
We are not the primary beneficiary of the Palo Verde VIEs and, accordingly, do not consolidate
them.

APS is exposed to losses under the Palo Verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of
certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur. Under certain
circumstances (for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde
or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to assume the debt associated
with the transactions, make specified payments to the equity participants, and take title to the
leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If
such an event had occurred as of December 31, 2006, APS would have been required to assume
approximately $214 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately $177 million.

SunCor has certain land development arrangements that are required to be consolidated under
FIN 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” The assets and non-controlling interests
reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these arrangements were approximately $39
million at December 31, 2006 and approximately $34 million at December 31, 2005.

21. Guarantees

We have issued parental guarantees and letters of credit and obtained surety bonds on behalf
of APS Energy Services. Our credit support instruments enable APS Energy Services to offer
commodity energy and energy-related products. Non-performance or non-payment under the original
contract by APS Energy Services would require us to perform under the guarantee or surety bond. No
liability is currently recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to Pinnacle
West’s current outstanding guarantees on behalf of its subsidiary. Our guarantees have no recourse
or collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under the guarantees. At December 31,
2006, we had guarantees totaling $16 million and surety bonds totaling $25 million with a term of
approximately one year for APS Energy Services.

At December 31, 2006, Pinnacle West had approximately $4 million of letters of credit related
to workers’ compensation expiring in 2007. We intend to provide from either existing or new
facilities for the extension, renewal or substitution of the letters of credit to the extent
required.

APS has entered into various agreements that require letters of credit for financial assurance
purposes. At December 31, 2006, approximately $200 million of letters of credit were outstanding
to support existing pollution control bonds of approximately $200 million. The letters of credit
are available to fund the payment of principal and interest of such debt obligations and expire in
2010. APS has also entered into approximately $91 million of letters of credit to support certain
equity lessors in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions (see Note 9 for further details on the
Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions). These letters of credit expire in 2010. Additionally, at
December 31, 2006, APS had approximately $4 million of letters of credit related to counterparty
collateral requirements expiring in 2007. APS intends to provide from either existing or new
facilities for the extension, renewal or substitution of the letters of credit to the extent
required.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We enter into agreements that include indemnification provisions relating to liabilities
arising from or related to certain of our agreements; most significantly, APS has agreed to
indemnify the equity participants and other parties in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions
with respect to certain tax matters. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in
the indemnification provisions and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under
such indemnification provisions cannot be reasonably estimated. Based on historical experience and
evaluation of the specific indemnities, we do not believe that any material loss related to such
indemnification provisions is likely.

22. Discontinued Operations

Silverhawk

(other)

–

In June 2005, we entered into an agreement to sell our 75% interest in
the Silverhawk Power Station to NPC. The sale was completed on January 10, 2006. As a result of
this sale, we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of approximately $56 million ($91
million pretax) in the second quarter of 2005. The chart below includes the revenues and expenses
related to the operations of Silverhawk. The assets held for sale at
December 31, 2005 were $203 million, of which property, plant and
equipment accounted for approximately $197 million.

SunCor

(real estate segment)

–

In 2006 and 2005, SunCor sold commercial properties, which are
required to be reported as discontinued operations on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of
Income in accordance with SFAS No. 144. As a result of the sales, we recorded a gain from
discontinued operations of approximately $9 million ($15 million pretax) in 2006 and $15 million
($25 million pretax) in 2005.

NAC

(other)

–

In 2004, we sold our investment in NAC, and in 2005 we recognized a gain of $4
million ($6 million pretax) in connection with the sale that had previously been subject to
contingencies.

The following table provides revenue, income (loss) before income taxes and income (loss)

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

(ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY)

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13(a)-15(f), for Arizona Public
Service Company. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation
under the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework,

our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. Our management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their report which is included herein and relates also to the Company’s financial
statements.

February 28, 2007



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Arizona Public Service Company

Phoenix, Arizona

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Arizona Public Service Company (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related statements of income, changes in common stock
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. We also have
audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial
statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule, an opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Furthermore, in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

As discussed in Note S-6 to the accompanying financial statements, effective December 31,
2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 158.

NOTES TO ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

S-1. Income Taxes

APS is included in Pinnacle West’s consolidated tax return. However, when Pinnacle West
allocates income taxes to APS, it is done based upon APS’ taxable income computed on a stand-alone
basis, in accordance with the tax sharing agreement.

Certain assets and liabilities are reported differently for income tax purposes than they are
for financial statements purposes. The tax effect of these differences is recorded as deferred
taxes. We calculate deferred taxes using the current income tax rates.

APS has recorded a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability related to income taxes on its
Balance Sheets in accordance with SFAS No. 71. The regulatory asset is for certain temporary
differences, primarily the allowance for equity funds used during construction. The regulatory
liability relates to excess deferred taxes resulting primarily from the reduction in federal income
tax rates as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. APS amortizes this amount as the differences
reverse.

As a result of a change in IRS guidance, we claimed a tax deduction related to an APS tax
accounting method change on the 2001 federal consolidated income tax return. The accelerated
deduction resulted in a $200 million reduction in the current income tax liability and a
corresponding increase in the plant-related deferred tax liability. The 2001 federal consolidated
income tax return is currently under examination by the IRS. As part of this ongoing examination,
the IRS is reviewing this accounting method change and the resultant deduction. During 2004 and
again in 2005, the current income tax liability was increased, with a corresponding decrease to
plant-related deferred tax liability, to reflect the expected outcome of this audit. We do not
expect the ultimate outcome of this examination to have a material adverse impact on our financial
position or results of operations. We expect that it will have a negative impact on cash flows.

The income tax liability accounts reflect the tax and interest associated with the most
probable resolution of all known and measurable tax exposures.

In 2006 and 2004, we resolved certain prior-year issues with the taxing authorities and
recorded tax benefits associated with tax credits and other reductions to income tax expense.

The components of APS’ income tax expense are as follows (dollars in thousands):

S-3. Derivative and Energy Trading Accounting

APS is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances. As part of its overall risk
management program, APS uses various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives to hedge
purchases and sales of electricity, fuels and emissions allowances and credits. As of December 31,
2006, APS hedged certain exposures to these risks for a maximum of 3.25 years.

Cash Flow Hedges

The changes in the fair value of APS’ hedged positions included in the APS Statements of
Income, after consideration of amounts deferred under the PSA, for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):




Gains (losses) on the ineffective portion of
derivatives qualifying for hedge
accounting

$

(5,666

)

$

14,452

$

(1,570

)

Gains (losses) from the change in options
time value excluded from measurement
of effectiveness

(10

)



Gains from the discontinuance of
cash flow hedges




During 2007, APS estimates that a net gain of $6 million before income taxes will be
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income as an offset to the effect of market price
changes for the related hedged transactions. To the extent the amounts are eligible for inclusion
in the PSA, the amounts will be recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability and have no
effect on earnings (see Note 3).



NOTES TO ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

APS’ assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities are presented in two
categories:

•

Regulated Electricity – non-trading derivative instruments that hedge APS’ purchases
and sales of electricity and fuel for its Native Load requirements; and

•

Marketing and Trading – both non-trading and trading derivative instruments.

We maintain a margin account with a broker to support our risk management and trading
activities. The margin account was an asset of $73 million at December 31, 2006 and a liability of
$123 million at December 31, 2005 and is included in the margin account in the table above. Cash
is deposited with the broker in this account at the time futures or options contracts are
initiated. The change in market value of these contracts (reflected in mark-to-market) requires
adjustment of the margin account balance.

Cash or other assets may be required to serve as collateral against APS’ open positions on
certain energy-related contracts. Collateral provided to counterparties was $2 million at December
31, 2006 and is included in other current assets on the balance sheet. No collateral was provided
to counterparties at December 31, 2005. Collateral provided to us by counterparties was $1 million
at December 31, 2006 and $175 million at December 31, 2005, and is included in other current
liabilities on the Balance Sheets.

Electric revenues include sales of electricity to affiliated companies at contract prices.
Purchased power includes purchases of electricity from affiliated companies at contract prices.
APS purchases electricity from and sells electricity to APS Energy Services; however, these
transactions are settled net and reported net in accordance with EITF 03-11, “Reporting Realized
Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not ‘Held
for Trading Purposes’ As Defined in EITF Issue No. 02-3.”

Intercompany receivables primarily include amounts related to the intercompany sales of
electricity. Intercompany payables primarily include amounts related to the intercompany purchases
of electricity. Intercompany receivables and payables are generally settled on a current basis in
cash.



NOTES TO ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

APS was authorized to acquire the PWEC Dedicated Assets from Pinnacle West Energy, with a net
carrying value of approximately $850 million, and to rate base the PWEC Dedicated Assets at a rate
base value of $700 million, which resulted in a mandatory rate base disallowance of approximately
$150 million. Due to depreciation and other miscellaneous factors, the actual disallowance was
$139 million at December 31, 2005. This transfer was completed on July 29, 2005. As a result,
for financial reporting purposes, APS recognized a one-time, after-tax net plant regulatory
disallowance of approximately $84 million in 2005. In connection with the transfer, APS recorded a
$500 million intercompany payable to Pinnacle West Energy. On October 3, 2005, APS settled the
intercompany payable.

S-6. Retirement
    Plans and Other Benefits

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans.” This guidance requires us to
    recognize the underfunded positions of our pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans on our December 31, 2006
    balance sheet. The guidance requires that the offset be reported
    in other comprehensive income, net of tax; however, because the
    obligations relate to our regulated operations, the increase in
    liabilities is offset by regulatory assets. The following tables
    provide details of the effects of implementing SFAS Statement
    No. 158 (dollars in thousands):

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS

ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term “disclosure controls and procedures” means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) (15 U.S.C.
78a

et seq

.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a
company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Pinnacle West’s management, with the participation of Pinnacle West’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of Pinnacle West’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006. Based on that evaluation, Pinnacle West’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of that date, Pinnacle West’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

APS’ management, with the participation of APS’ Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of APS’ disclosure controls and procedures as of December
31, 2006. Based on that evaluation, APS’ Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that, as of that date, APS’ disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

(b) Management’s Annual Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Reference is made to “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
(Pinnacle West Capital Corporation)” on page 69 of this report and “Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (Arizona Public Service
Company)” on page 127 of this
report.

(c) Attestation Reports of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

Reference
is made to “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm” on page 70 of
this report and “Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm” on page 128 of this
report on the internal control over financial reporting of Pinnacle West and APS, respectively.

(d) Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
