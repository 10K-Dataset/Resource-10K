Item 1.

Business

Description of Business

Southwest Airlines Co. (“Southwest” or the “Company”) is a major domestic airline that
provides point-to-point, low-fare service. Historically, routes served by Southwest had been
predominantly short-haul, with high frequencies. In recent years, the Company has complemented
this service with more medium to long-haul routes, including transcontinental service. Southwest
was incorporated in Texas in 1967 and commenced Customer Service on June 18, 1971, with three
Boeing 737 aircraft serving three Texas cities — Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio.

At year-end 2004, Southwest operated 417 Boeing 737 aircraft and provided service to 60
airports in 59 cities in 31 states throughout the United States. Southwest Airlines topped the
monthly domestic passenger traffic rankings published by the Department of Transportation (“DOT”)
for the first time in May 2003. Based on monthly data for October 2004 (the latest available
data), Southwest Airlines is the largest carrier in the United States based on originating domestic
passengers boarded and scheduled domestic departures. The Company began service to Philadelphia in
May 2004, and recently announced it will begin service to Pittsburgh in May 2005.

One of Southwest’s primary competitive strengths is its low operating costs. Southwest has the
lowest costs, adjusted for stage length, on a per mile basis, of all the major airlines. Among the
factors that contribute to its low cost structure are a single aircraft type, an efficient,
high-utilization, point-to-point route structure, and hardworking, innovative, and highly
productive Employees.

The business of the Company is somewhat seasonal. Quarterly operating income and, to a lesser
extent, revenues tend to be lower in the first quarter (January 1 - March 31) and fourth quarter
(October 1 - December 31) of most years.

Southwest’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its annual
report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to
those reports, are accessible free of charge at www.southwest.com.

Fuel

The cost of fuel is an item that has significant impact on the Company’s operating results.
The Company’s average cost of jet fuel, net of hedging gains, over the past five years was as

Regulation

Economic.

The Dallas Love Field section of the International Air Transportation Competition
Act of 1979, as amended in 1997 (commonly known as the “Wright Amendment”), as it affects
Southwest’s scheduled service, provides that no common carrier may provide scheduled passenger air
transportation for compensation between Love Field and one or more points outside Texas, except
that an air carrier may transport individuals by air on a flight between Love Field and one or more
points within the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, and Texas if (a) “such air carrier does not offer or provide any through service or
ticketing with another air carrier” and (b) “such air carrier does not offer for sale
transportation to or from, and the flight or aircraft does not serve, any point which is outside
any such states.” The Wright Amendment does not restrict flights operated with aircraft having 56
or fewer passenger seats. The Wright Amendment does not restrict Southwest’s intrastate Texas
flights or its air service from points other than Love Field

.

The Department of Transportation (“DOT”) has significant regulatory jurisdiction over
passenger airlines. Unless exempted, no air carrier may furnish air transportation over any route
without a DOT certificate of public convenience and necessity, which does not confer either
exclusive or proprietary rights. The Company’s certificates are unlimited in duration and permit
the Company to operate among any points within the United States, its territories and possessions,
except as limited by the Wright Amendment, as do the certificates of all other U.S. carriers. DOT
may revoke such certificates, in whole or in part, for intentional failure to comply with certain
provisions of the U.S. Transportation Code, or any order or regulation issued thereunder or any
term of such certificate; provided that, with respect to revocation, the certificate holder has
first been advised of the alleged violation and fails to comply after being given a reasonable time
to do so.

DOT prescribes uniform disclosure standards regarding terms and conditions of carriage and
prescribes that terms incorporated into the Contract of Carriage by reference are not binding upon
passengers unless notice is given in accordance with its regulations.

Safety.

The Company and its third-party maintenance providers are subject to the jurisdiction
of the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) with respect to its aircraft maintenance and
operations, including equipment, ground facilities, dispatch, communications, flight training
personnel, and other matters affecting air safety. To ensure compliance with its regulations, the
FAA requires airlines to obtain operating, airworthiness, and other certificates, which are subject
to suspension or revocation for cause. The Company has obtained such certificates. The FAA, acting
through its own powers or through the appropriate U.S. Attorney, also has the power to bring
proceedings for the imposition and collection of fines for violation of the Federal Air
Regulations.

The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations
relating to occupational safety and health, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.

Security.

The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (“Security Act”) generally provides
for enhanced aviation security measures. The Security Act established a new Transportation
Security Administration (“TSA”), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The TSA
assumed the aviation security functions previously residing in the FAA and assumed passenger
screening contracts at U.S. airports in February 2002. The TSA provides for the screening of all
passengers and property, which is performed by federal employees. Beginning February 1, 2002, a
$2.50 per enplanement security fee is imposed on passengers (maximum of $5.00 per one-way trip).
This fee was suspended by Congress from June 1 through September 30, 2003. Pursuant to authority
granted to the TSA to impose additional fees on air carriers if necessary to cover additional
federal aviation security costs, the TSA has imposed an annual



Security Infrastructure Fee, which
approximated $18 million for Southwest in 2003 and $26 million in 2004. This fee
was also suspended by Congress from June 1 through September 30, 2003. Like the FAA, the TSA
may impose and collect fines for violations of its regulations.

Enhanced security measures have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on the
airport experience for passengers. While these security requirements have not impacted aircraft
utilization, they have impacted our business. The Company has invested significantly in
facilities, equipment, and technology to process Customers efficiently and restore the airport
experience. The Company has implemented its Automated Boarding Passes and RAPID CHECK-IN self
service kiosks in all airports it serves to reduce the number of lines in which a Customer must
wait. During 2003 and 2004, the Company also installed gate readers at all of its airports to
improve the boarding reconciliation process. In 2004, Southwest introduced baggage checkin through
RAPID CHECK-IN kiosks at certain airport locations and also introduced Internet checkin and
transfer boarding passes at the time of checkin.

Environmental.

Certain airports, including San Diego and Orange County, have established
airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on aircraft types to be used, and
limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such operations. In some
instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs
and such restrictions could limit the ability of Southwest to expand its operations at the affected
airports. Local authorities at other airports may consider adopting similar noise regulations, but
such regulations are subject to the provisions of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

Operations at John Wayne Airport, Orange County, California, are governed by the Airport’s
Phase 2 Commercial Airline Access Plan and Regulation (the “Plan”). Pursuant to the Plan, each
airline is allocated total annual seat capacity to be operated at the airport, subject to
renewal/reallocation on an annual basis. Service at this airport may be adjusted annually to meet
these requirements.

The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment, including the discharge or disposal of materials
such as chemicals, hazardous waste, and aircraft deicing fluid. Regulatory developments pertaining
to such things as control of engine exhaust emissions from ground support equipment and prevention
of leaks from underground aircraft fueling systems could increase operating costs in the airline
industry. The Company does not believe, however, that such environmental regulatory developments
will have a material impact on the Company’s capital expenditures or otherwise adversely effect its
operations, operating costs, or competitive position. Additionally, in conjunction with airport
authorities, other airlines, and state and local environmental regulatory agencies, the Company is
undertaking voluntary investigation or remediation of soil or groundwater contamination at several
airport sites. The Company does not believe that any environmental liability associated with such
sites will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations, costs, or profitability.

Customer Service Commitment.

From time to time, the airline transportation industry has been
faced with possible legislation dealing with certain Customer service practices. As a compromise
with Congress, the industry, working with the Air Transport Association, has responded by adopting
and filing with the DOT written plans disclosing how it would commit to improving performance.
Southwest Airlines formalized its dedication to Customer Satisfaction by adopting its Customer
Service Commitment, a comprehensive plan which embodies the Mission Statement of Southwest
Airlines: dedication to the highest quality of Customer Service delivered with a sense of warmth,
friendliness, individual pride, and Company Spirit. The Customer Service Commitment can be
reviewed by clicking on “About SWA” at www.southwest.com. The DOT and Congress are expected to
monitor the effects of the industry’s plans, and there can be no assurance that legislation or
regulations will not be proposed in the future to regulate airline Customer service practices.



Marketing and Competition

Southwest focuses principally on point-to-point, rather than hub-and-spoke, service in markets
with
frequent, conveniently timed flights and low fares. At year-end, Southwest served 359 nonstop
city pairs. Southwest’s average aircraft trip stage length in 2004 was 576 miles with an average
duration of approximately 1.5 hours. Examples of markets offering frequent daily flights are:
Dallas to Houston Hobby, 29 weekday roundtrips; Phoenix to Las Vegas, 19 weekday roundtrips; and
Los Angeles International to Oakland, 22 weekday roundtrips. Southwest complements these
high-frequency shorthaul routes with longhaul nonstop service between markets such as Baltimore and
Los Angeles, Phoenix and Tampa Bay, Las Vegas and Nashville, and Houston and Oakland.

Southwest’s point-to-point route system, as compared to hub-and-spoke, provides for more
direct nonstop routings for Customers and, therefore, minimizes connections, delays, and total trip
time. Southwest focuses on nonstop, not connecting, traffic. As a result, approximately 78 percent
of the Company’s Customers fly nonstop. In addition, Southwest serves many conveniently located
secondary or downtown airports such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Chicago Midway,
Baltimore-Washington International, Burbank, Manchester, Oakland, San Jose, Providence, Ft.
Lauderdale/Hollywood, and Long Island Islip airports, which are typically less congested than other
airlines’ hub airports and enhance the Company’s ability to sustain high Employee productivity and
reliable ontime performance. This operating strategy also permits the Company to achieve high
asset utilization. Aircraft are scheduled to minimize the amount of time the aircraft are at the
gate, currently approximately 25 minutes, thereby reducing the number of aircraft and gate
facilities than would otherwise be required. The Company operates only one aircraft type, the
Boeing 737, which simplifies scheduling, maintenance, flight operations, and training activities.

In first quarter 2005, Southwest began its first codeshare arrangement, with ATA Airlines.
Under this codeshare arrangement, Southwest and ATA will exchange Customers at Chicago Midway
Airport, initially, with a limited number of other connect points to be subsequently added as our
respective ground facilities permit. Under this codeshare arrangement, Southwest may market and
sell tickets for certain flights on ATA that are identified by Southwest’s designator code, e.g.,
WN Flight 123. Conversely, ATA may market and sell tickets under its code designator (TZ) for
certain flights on Southwest Airlines. All codeshare itineraries marketed by either airline will
involve connecting service between a Southwest flight and a flight operated by ATA. Any flight
bearing a Southwest code designator that is operated by ATA will be disclosed in Southwest’s
reservations systems and on the Customer’s flight itinerary, boarding pass, and ticket, if a paper
ticket is issued. Other than the ATA agreement, Southwest does not interline or offer joint fares
with other airlines, nor does Southwest have any commuter feeder relationships.

Southwest employs a relatively simple fare structure, featuring low, unrestricted, unlimited,
everyday coach fares, as well as even lower fares available on a restricted basis. The Company’s
highest non-codeshare, oneway unrestricted walkup fare offered is $299 for any flight. Even lower
walkup fares are available on Southwest’s short and medium haul flights.

Southwest was the first major airline to introduce a Ticketless travel option, eliminating the
need to print and then process a paper ticket altogether, and the first to offer Ticketless travel
through the Company’s home page on the Internet, www.southwest.com. For the year ended December
31, 2004, more than 90 percent of Southwest’s Customers chose the Ticketless travel option and
approximately 59 percent of Southwest’s passenger revenues came through its Internet site, which
has become a vital part of the Company’s distribution strategy. The Company has not paid
commissions to travel agents for sales since December 15, 2003.



The airline industry is highly competitive as to fares, frequent flyer benefits, routes, and
service, and some carriers competing with the Company have larger fleets and wider name
recognition. Certain major United States airlines have established marketing or codesharing
alliances with each other, including Northwest Airlines/Continental Airlines/Delta Air Lines;
American Airlines/Alaska Airlines; and United Airlines/US Airways.

Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the airline industry, as a whole, has
incurred substantial losses. As a result, a number of carriers, including UAL, the parent of
United Airlines, US Airways, and ATA Airlines, Inc. sought relief from financial obligations in
bankruptcy. Other, smaller carriers have ceased operation entirely. America West Airlines, US
Airways, Aloha, ATA, and others received federal loan guarantees authorized by federal law. Since
September 11, low cost carriers such as AirTran have accelerated their growth and legacy carriers
have added back some of the capacity they reduced immediately following September 11. Faced with
increasing low fare and lower cost competition, growing customer demand for lower fares, and record
high energy costs, legacy carriers have aggressively sought to reduce their cost structures,
largely through downsized work forces and renegotiated collective bargaining and vendor agreements.
Southwest has maintained its low cost competitive advantage and continues to reduce its cost
structure through increased productivity.

The Company is also subject to varying degrees of competition from surface transportation in
its shorthaul markets, particularly the private automobile. In shorthaul air services that compete
with surface transportation, price is a competitive factor, but frequency and convenience of
scheduling, facilities, transportation safety and security procedures, and Customer Service are
also of great importance to many passengers.

Insurance

The Company carries insurance of types customary in the airline industry and at amounts deemed
adequate to protect the Company and its property and to comply both with federal regulations and
certain of the Company’s credit and lease agreements. The policies principally provide coverage
for public and passenger liability, property damage, cargo and baggage liability, loss or damage to
aircraft, engines, and spare parts, and workers’ compensation.

Following the terrorist attacks, commercial aviation insurers significantly increased the
premiums and reduced the amount of war-risk coverage available to commercial carriers. The federal
government stepped in to provide supplemental third-party war-risk insurance coverage to commercial
carriers for renewable 60-day periods, at substantially lower premiums than prevailing commercial
rates and for levels of coverage not available in the commercial market. In November 2002, Congress
passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which mandated the federal government to provide third
party, passenger, and hull war-risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers through August 31,
2003, and which permitted such coverage to be extended by the government through December 31, 2003.
The Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements) extended the government’s mandate to provide war-risk insurance until December 31,
2004. Pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, Congress further extended the
government’s mandate to provide war-risk insurance until August 31, 2005, at the discretion of the
Secretary of Transportation. The Company is unable to predict whether the government will extend
this insurance coverage past August 31, 2005, whether alternative commercial insurance with
comparable coverage will become available at reasonable premiums, and what impact this will have on
the Company’s ongoing operations or future financial performance.



Frequent Flyer Awards

Southwest’s frequent flyer program, Rapid Rewards, is based on trips flown rather than
mileage. Rapid Rewards Customers earn a credit for each one-way trip flown or two
credits for each roundtrip flown. Rapid Rewards Customers can also receive credits
by using the services of non-airline partners, which include car
rental agencies, hotels, telecommunications companies and
credit card partners, including the Southwest Airlines Chase (formerly Bank One) Visa card. Rapid
Rewards offers two types of travel awards. The Rapid Rewards Award Ticket (“Award Ticket”) offers
one free roundtrip award valid to any destination available on Southwest after the accumulation of 16
credits within a consecutive twelve-month period. The Rapid Rewards Companion Pass
(“Companion Pass”) is granted for flying 50 roundtrips (or
100 one-way trips) on Southwest or earning 100 credits within a
consecutive twelve-month period. The Companion Pass offers unlimited free roundtrip travel to any
destination available on Southwest for a designated companion of the qualifying Rapid Rewards member. In order
for the designated companion to use this pass, the Rapid Rewards member must purchase a ticket or
use an Award Ticket. Additionally, the Rapid Rewards member and designated companion must travel
together on the same flight.

Trips flown are valid for credits toward Award Tickets and Companion Passes for
twelve months only; Award Tickets and Companion Passes are automatically generated when earned by
the Customer rather than allowing the Customer to bank credits indefinitely; and Award Tickets and
Companion Passes are valid for one year with an automatic expiration date. “Black out” dates apply
during peak holiday periods. Unlike most of its competitors, the Company does not limit the number
of seats available to holders of Award Tickets and Companion Passes.

The Company also sells credits to business partners including credit card
companies, hotels, telecommunications companies and car rental agencies. These credits may be redeemed for Award Tickets having
the same program characteristics as those earned by flying.

Customers redeemed approximately 2.5 million, 2.5 million, and 2.2 million Award Tickets and
flights on Companion Passes during 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The amount of free travel
award usage as a percentage of total Southwest revenue passengers carried was 7.1 percent in 2004,
7.5 percent in 2003, and 6.8 percent in 2002. The number of fully earned Award Tickets and
partially earned awards outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately 7.0 million,
approximately 80 percent of which were partially earned awards. However, due to the expected
expiration of a portion of credits making up these partial awards, not all of them will eventually
turn into useable Award Tickets. Also, not all Award Tickets will be redeemed for future travel.
Since the inception of Rapid Rewards in 1987, approximately 14 percent of all fully earned Award
Tickets have expired without being used. The number of Companion Passes for Southwest outstanding
at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately 60,000 and 53,000, respectively. The Company
currently estimates that an average of 3 to 4 trips will be redeemed per outstanding Companion
Pass.

The Company accounts for its frequent flyer program obligations by recording a liability for
the estimated incremental cost of flight awards the Company expects to be redeemed (except for credits sold to business partners). This method recognizes an average incremental
cost to provide roundtrip transportation to one additional passenger. The estimated incremental
cost includes direct passenger costs such as fuel, food, and other operational costs, but does not
include any contribution to overhead or profit. The incremental cost is accrued at the time an
award is earned and revenue is subsequently recognized, at the amount accrued, when the free travel
award is used. Revenue from the sale of credits and associated with future travel
is deferred and recognized when the ultimate free travel award is flown or the credits expire
unused. Accordingly, Southwest does not accrue incremental cost for the expected redemption of
free travel awards for credits sold to business partners. The liability for free travel awards
earned but not used at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was not material.



Employees

At December 31, 2004, Southwest had 31,011 active Employees, consisting of 11,442 flight,
1,972 maintenance, 13,414 ground, Customer, and fleet service and 4,183 management, accounting,
marketing, and clerical personnel.

Southwest has ten collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 81.2 percent of its
Employees. The following table sets forth the Company’s Employee groups and collective bargaining

Ground Facilities and Services

Southwest leases terminal passenger service facilities at each of the airports it serves, to
which it has added various leasehold improvements. The Company leases land on a long-term basis
for its maintenance centers located at Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Phoenix Sky Harbor, and
Chicago Midway, its training center near Love Field, which houses six 737 simulators, and its
corporate headquarters, also located near Love Field. The maintenance, training center, and
corporate headquarters buildings on these sites were built and are owned by Southwest. During
first quarter 2004, the Company closed its Dallas, Salt Lake City, and Little Rock reservations
centers. At December 31, 2004, the Company operated six reservation centers. The reservation
centers located in Chicago, Albuquerque, and Oklahoma City occupy leased space. The Company owns
its Houston, Phoenix, and San Antonio reservation centers.

Southwest has entered into a concession agreement with the Town of Islip, New York which gives
the Company the right to construct, furnish, occupy, and maintain a new concourse at the airport.
Once all phases of the project are completed, the concourse could have up to eight gates. Phase I
of this project, which began operations in August 2004, includes four gates. The Company has
announced plans to construct Phase II of the project, which includes an additional 4 gates. When
all phases of construction are complete, the entire new concourse will become the property of the
Town of Islip. In return for constructing the new concourse, Southwest will receive fixed-rent
abatements for a total of 25 years; however, the Company will still be required to pay variable
rents for common use areas and manage the new concourse.



The Company performs substantially all line maintenance on its aircraft and provides ground
support
services at most of the airports it serves. However, the Company has arrangements with certain
aircraft maintenance firms for major component inspections and repairs for its airframes and
engines, which comprise the majority of the annual aircraft maintenance costs.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course
of business, including, but not limited to, examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The
IRS regularly examines the Company’s federal income tax returns and, in the course of those
examinations, proposes adjustments to the Company’s federal income tax liability reported on such
returns. It is the Company’s practice to vigorously contest those proposed adjustments that it
deems lacking of merit. The Company’s management does not expect that the outcome in any of its
currently ongoing legal proceedings or the outcome of any proposed adjustments presented to date by
the IRS, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

The issuance of the above options and shares to Mr. Kelleher were deemed exempt from the
registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), by reason
of the provision of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act because, among other things, of the limited
number of participants in such transactions and the agreement and representation of Mr. Kelleher
that he was acquiring such securities for investment and not with a view to distribution thereof.
The certificates representing the shares issued to Mr. Kelleher contain a legend to the effect that
such shares are not registered under the Securities Act and may not be transferred except pursuant
to a registration statement which has become effective under the Securities Act or to an exemption
from such registration. The issuance of such shares was not underwritten.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEAR IN REVIEW

In 2004, Southwest posted a profit for its 32

nd

consecutive year, and 55

th

consecutive quarter. Southwest’s 2004 profit of $313 million exceeded our 2003 profit, excluding
the impact of a 2003 federal government grant, by 5.0 percent. These achievements were
accomplished despite record-high energy prices, and aggressive industry growth, which contributed
to the continuing weak airline revenue environment. For the fourth consecutive year, the airline
industry as a whole suffered a substantial net loss. As a result, certain carriers filed for
bankruptcy protection, and many carriers underwent or continued massive efforts to restructure
their business, gain wage concessions from their employees, and slash costs.

To maintain its low-cost competitive advantage, the Company continued its Company-wide efforts to
improve its cost structure. As a result, the Company increased productivity at all Employee
levels, and improved the overall efficiency of its operations. In November 2003, the Company
announced the consolidation of its Reservations centers from nine to six, effective February 2004.
Of the 1,900 Employees affected, approximately 1,000 did not elect to move to one of the Company’s
remaining reservations locations. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information. In second quarter 2004, the Company offered an early-out option to substantially all
Employees, primarily in an effort to alleviate overstaffing in certain areas of the Company. The
overstaffing primarily was the result of slower passenger growth; changes in Customer buying habits
and boarding processes; and the federalization of airport security. Due to these and other
productivity efforts, the Company’s headcount per aircraft decreased from 85 at December 31, 2003,
to 74 at December 31, 2004.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company has added “blended winglets” to approximately 92 percent of
its fleet of 737-700 aircraft. The addition of these wing enhancements, which are expected to be
completed for all 737-700 aircraft in early 2005, extend the range of these aircraft, save fuel,
lower potential engine maintenance costs, and reduce takeoff noise. All new 737-700 aircraft now
arrive from Boeing with winglets already installed. The Company expects annual fuel consumption
savings of approximately 3 percent for each aircraft outfitted with the winglets. The Company also
phased out commissions on travel agency sales in 2004, consistent with virtually all other U.S.
airlines. This change in policy saved the Company approximately $50 million in 2004.

Demand for air travel was stronger in 2004, albeit at depressed fare levels. Southwest had
Company-record load factors for every month from March to July. For full year 2004, Southwest’s
load factor was 69.5 percent, which was up 2.7 points from 2003, and represented the second highest
load factor in the Company’s history. Passenger revenue yield per RPM, on the other hand, was down
1.8 percent compared to 2003. Overall, unit revenues continue to run well below pre-September 11,
2001, levels, and the percentage of Customers traveling on full fares remains down from historical
levels. The Company does not anticipate a complete recovery in revenues until full fare business
travel fully recovers or there is a rationalization of industry capacity.

The Company believes that, despite the difficult airline industry environment, it is well
positioned to grow and remain profitable in 2005. The Company’s low-cost competitive advantage,
protective fuel hedging position, and excellent Employees have allowed Southwest to react quickly
to market opportunities. The Company added Philadelphia to its route system in May 2004, and
ramped up growth at Chicago Midway Airport. In fourth quarter 2004, Southwest was selected as the
winning bidder at a bankruptcy-court approved auction for certain ATA Airlines, Inc. (ATA) assets,
which ensures the Company can continue to add low-fare service in Chicago. As part of the
transaction, which closed in December 2004, Southwest agreed to pay $40 million for certain ATA
assets, consisting of the leasehold rights to six ATA Chicago Midway Airport gates



and the
leasehold rights to an aircraft maintenance hangar at Midway. Southwest and ATA have also agreed
to a codeshare arrangement, which was approved by the Department of Transportation in January 2005,
in which
each carrier will exchange passengers on select routes at Midway. The Company believes this
agreement could result in additional revenues of $25 million to $50 million, annually. In
addition, Southwest has provided ATA with debtor in possession financing and made other financial
commitments to ATA. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

During 2004, the Company added 47 new 737-700 aircraft to its fleet and retired 18 older 737-200
aircraft, resulting in a net available seat mile (ASM) capacity increase of 7.1 percent. This
brought the Company’s all-737 fleet to 417 aircraft at the end of 2004. The demand for Southwest’s
low fare, high-quality Customer Service flights in Philadelphia has made this city the Company’s
most aggressive new city start ever. Also, in January 2005, the Company announced that Pittsburgh
would become the 60

th

city the Company flies to, with daily service beginning May 2005.

ASM capacity currently is expected to grow approximately 10 percent in 2005 with the planned net
addition of 29 aircraft. The Company currently has 34 new Boeing 737–700s scheduled for delivery
during the year and will retire all five of its remaining 737-200s in January 2005.



Results of Operation

2004 Compared With 2003

The Company’s consolidated net income for 2004 was $313 million ($.38 per
share, diluted), as compared to 2003 net income of $442 million ($.54 per share, diluted), a
decrease of $129 million or 29.2 percent. Operating income for 2004 was $554 million, an increase
of $71 million, or 14.7 percent compared to 2003.

As disclosed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, results for 2003 included $271
million as “Other gains” from the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (Wartime Act).
The Company believes that excluding the impact of this special item will enhance comparative
analysis of results. The grant was made to stabilize and support the airline industry as a result
of the 2003 war with Iraq. Financial results including the grant were not indicative of the
Company’s operating performance for 2003, nor should they be considered in developing trend
analysis for future periods. There were no special items in 2004. The following table reconciles
and compares results reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
for 2004 and 2003 with results excluding the impact of the government grant received in 2003:

Excluding the government grant received, consolidated net income for 2004 increased $15
million, or 5.0 percent, compared to 2003 net income of $298 million. The increase primarily was
due to higher revenues from the Company’s fleet growth and addition of capacity, which slightly
exceeded higher costs. Excluding the impact of the 2003 government grant, operating income
increased $31 million, or 5.9 percent, compared to 2003.

OPERATING REVENUES Consolidated operating revenues increased $593 million, or 10.0 percent,
primarily due to a $539 million, or 9.4 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase in
passenger revenues primarily was due to an 11.4 percent increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs)
flown, driven by the Company’s growth and a 2.7 point increase in the Company’s load factor
compared to 2003.

The Company increased available seat miles (ASMs) by 7.1 percent compared to 2003, primarily as a
result of the net addition of 29 aircraft during 2004 (47 new aircraft, net of 18 aircraft
retirements). The Company’s load factor for 2004 (RPMs divided by ASMs) was 69.5 percent, compared
to 66.8 percent for 2003. Although this represented a strong load factor performance for the
Company, passenger yields for 2004 (passenger revenue



divided by RPMs) remained under considerable
pressure due to significant capacity increases by a large majority of carriers. Passenger yields
for 2004 declined to $.1176, compared to $.1197 in 2003, a decrease of 1.8 percent, because of
heavy fare discounting arising as a result of the glut in industry seats available.

The Company believes the pressure on passenger yields will continue into the foreseeable future,
barring a dramatic decrease in industry capacity or a strong upturn in full fare travel. However,
continued industry discounting will most likely keep load factors at elevated levels compared to
historical averages. The Company’s January 2005 load factor was 58.8 percent, which was 2.6 points
higher than January 2004’s load factor of 56.2 percent. However, we expect January 2005’s
passenger unit revenues to fall below the year ago performance.

Consolidated freight revenues increased $23 million, or 24.5 percent. Approximately 70 percent of
the increase was due to an increase in freight and cargo revenues, primarily due to more units
shipped. The remaining 30 percent of the increase was due to higher mail revenues, as the U.S.
Postal Service shifted more business to commercial carriers. Other revenues increased $31 million,
or 30.4 percent, primarily due to an increase in commissions earned from programs the Company
sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company-sponsored Chase® (formerly Bank One)
Visa card. The Company expects continued year-over-year increases in both freight and other
revenues in first quarter 2005, in comparison to first quarter 2004; however, not at the rate
experienced in 2004.

OPERATING EXPENSES Consolidated operating expenses for 2004 increased $522 million, or 9.6
percent, compared to the 7.1 percent increase in capacity. To a large extent, changes in operating
expenses for airlines are driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents
Southwest’s operating expenses per ASM for 2004 and 2003 followed by explanations of these changes
on a per-ASM basis:

%

Operating expenses per ASM increased 2.2 percent to $.0777, primarily due to an increase in
jet fuel prices, net of hedging gains, and an increase in salaries, wages, and benefits. These
increases were partially offset by the Company’s elimination of commissions paid to travel agents,
which was effective December 15, 2003. For first quarter 2005, the Company currently expects
operating expenses per ASM, excluding fuel, to decline from first quarter 2004’s unit costs,
excluding fuel, of 6.57 cents, primarily due to year-over-year decreases in salaries, wages, and
benefits and maintenance costs per ASM. The expected decrease in salaries, wages, and benefits per
ASM will primarily be due to $13 million in severance and relocation costs associated with the
Company’s reservations center consolidation in first quarter 2004. For the year 2005, the Company
expects unit costs, excluding fuel, to be lower than 2004.

Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased 2.6 percent, inclusive of $40 million in
additional expense from the profitsharing impact of the 2003 government grant. Excluding the
profitsharing impact of



the 2003 government grant, approximately 70 percent of the increase per ASM
was due to higher salaries expense, primarily from higher average wage rates, and 25 percent was
due to higher benefits costs, primarily health care and workers’ compensation. For fourth quarter
2004 versus 2003, salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM decreased 1.0 percent, as the Company
benefited from increased labor productivity. This increase in productivity was driven primarily by
headcount reductions from the Company’s reservations center consolidation and early-out program
during 2004, and slowed hiring. The Company expects to experience a decrease in salaries, wages,
and benefits per ASM in first quarter 2005 due, in part, to severance and other charges related to
the consolidation of the Company’s reservations centers in first quarter 2004, along with increased
productivity. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During second quarter 2004, the Company and the Transport Workers Union Local 556 reached a
tentative labor agreement (contract) for the Company’s Flight Attendants, which includes both pay
increases and the issuance of stock options. During July 2004, a majority of the Company’s Flight
Attendants ratified the contract, which is for the period from June 1, 2002, to May 31, 2008.

During third quarter 2004, the Company and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association,
representing the Company’s Mechanics, agreed to extend the date the current agreement becomes
amendable to August 2008. The extension includes both pay raises and the issuance of stock
options, and was ratified by a majority of the Company’s Mechanics.

During third quarter 2004, the Company and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, representing
the Company’s Flight Simulator Technicians, agreed to extend the date the current agreement becomes
amendable to November 2011. The extension includes both pay raises and the issuance of stock
options, and was ratified by a majority of the Company’s Simulator Technicians.

Fuel and oil expense per ASM increased 12.1 percent, primarily due to a 14.5 percent increase in
the average jet fuel cost per gallon, net of hedging gains. The average cost per gallon of jet
fuel in 2004 was 82.8 cents compared to 72.3 cents in 2003, excluding fuel-related taxes but
including the effects of hedging activities. The Company’s 2004 and 2003 average jet fuel costs
are net of approximately $455 million and $171 million in gains from hedging activities,
respectively. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in fuel prices
was partially offset by steps the Company has taken to better the fuel efficiency of its aircraft.
These steps primarily included the addition of blended winglets to 177 of the Company’s 737-700
aircraft as of December 31, 2004, and the upgrade of certain engine components on many aircraft.
The Company estimates that these and other efficiency gains saved the Company approximately $28
million, at 2004 average unhedged market jet fuel prices.

As detailed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has hedges in place
for approximately 85 percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in 2005 with a combination of
derivative instruments that effectively cap prices at a crude oil equivalent price of approximately
$26 per barrel. Considering current market prices and the continued effectiveness of the Company’s
fuel hedges, the Company is forecasting first quarter 2005 average fuel cost per gallon, net of
expected hedging gains, to exceed fourth quarter 2004’s average price per gallon of 89.1 cents.
The majority of the Company’s near term hedge positions are in the form of option contracts, which
protect the Company in the event of rising jet fuel prices and allow the Company to benefit in the
event of declining prices.

Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM were flat compared to 2003. Currently, the Company
expects a decrease in maintenance materials and repairs expense per ASM in first quarter 2005,
versus first quarter 2004, due to a decrease in the number of scheduled maintenance events.

Agency commissions per ASM decreased to zero, due to the elimination of commissions paid to travel
agents, effective December 15, 2003. The Company records commission expense in the period of
travel, not the period of sale. Consequently, the Company recognized small amounts of commission
expense in 2004 as all pre-



December 15, 2003 commissionable sales were flown, primarily in the
first quarter of 2004. For the full year 2003, approximately 16 percent of passenger revenues were
commissionable, based on the Company’s previous policy of paying a 5 percent commission to travel
agents. For 2004, approximately 13 percent of revenues were derived through travel agents, 59
percent through the Company’s web site at

southwest.com

, and the remaining portion through the
Company’s Reservations Centers. For fourth quarter 2004, approximately 63 percent of passenger
revenues were derived from southwest.com.

Aircraft rentals per ASM and depreciation and amortization expense per ASM were both impacted by a
higher percentage of the aircraft fleet being owned. Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 8.0
percent while depreciation and amortization expense per ASM increased 5.7 percent. Of the 47
aircraft the Company acquired during 2004, 46 are owned and one is on operating lease. This, along
with the retirement of 16 owned and two leased aircraft, has increased the Company’s percentage of
aircraft owned or on capital lease to 79 percent at December 31, 2004, from 77 percent at December
31, 2003. Based on the Company’s scheduled 2005 capacity increases and aircraft financing plans,
the Company expects a year-over-year decline in aircraft rental expense per ASM in 2005.

Landing fees and other rentals per ASM increased 1.9 percent primarily due to the Company’s
expansion of gate and counter space at several airports across our system.

Other operating expenses per ASM were flat compared to 2003. An increase in expense from higher
fuel taxes as a result of the substantial increase in fuel prices was mostly offset by lower
advertising expense.

OTHER “Other expenses (income)” included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income,
and other gains and losses. Interest expense decreased by $3 million, or 3.3 percent, primarily
due to the Company’s October 2003 redemption of $100 million of senior unsecured 8 3/4% Notes
originally issued in 1991. This decrease was partially offset by the Company’s September 2004
issuance of $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes and the fourth quarter 2004 issuance of $112
million in floating-rate financing. Concurrently with the September 2004 issuance, the Company
entered into an interest-rate swap agreement to convert this fixed-rate debt to floating rate. See
Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the interest-rate swap
agreement. Excluding the effect of any new debt offerings the Company may execute during 2005, the
Company expects an increase in interest expense compared to 2004, due to the full year effect of
the $350 million Notes, the fourth quarter 2004 issuance of $112 million in floating-rate
financing, and higher expected floating interest rates. These increases are expected to more than
offset a decrease in expense from the March 2005 redemption of $100 million 8% senior unsecured
notes. Capitalized interest increased $6 million, or 18.2 percent, primarily as a result of higher
2004 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries, compared to 2003.
Interest income decreased $3 million, or 12.5 percent, primarily due to a decrease in average
invested cash balances. Other gains in 2003 primarily resulted from the government grant of $271
million received pursuant to the Wartime Act. See Note 3 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion of the grant. Other losses in 2004 primarily include amounts
recorded in accordance with SFAS 133. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
more information on the Company’s hedging activities. During 2004, the Company recognized
approximately $24 million of expense related to amounts excluded from the Company’s measurements of
hedge effectiveness and $13 million in expense related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges.

INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased to
35.94 percent in 2004 from 37.60 percent in 2003. Approximately half of the rate reduction
primarily was
due to lower effective state income tax rates. The remainder of the decrease primarily was due to
a reduction in estimated liabilities for prior year taxes as a result of discussions with taxing
authorities. The Company expects its 2005 effective tax rate to be approximately 38 percent.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

The Company’s consolidated net income for 2003 was $442 million ($.54 per
share, diluted), as compared to 2002 net income of $241 million ($.30 per share, diluted), an
increase of



$201 million, or 83.4 percent. Operating income for 2003 was $483 million, an increase
of $66 million, or 15.8 percent compared to 2002.

As disclosed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, results for 2003 included $271
million as “Other gains” from the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (Wartime Act)
and results for 2002 included $48 million as “Other gains” from grants under the Air Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act (Stabilization Act). The Company believes that excluding the
impact of these special items will enhance comparative analysis of results. The grants were made
to stabilize and support the airline industry as a result of the devastating effects of the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2003 war with Iraq. Neither of these grants were
indicative of the Company’s operating performance for these respective periods, nor should they be
considered in developing trend analysis for future periods. The following table reconciles results
reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for 2003 with results
excluding the impact of the government grant received in that period:

Excluding the governments grants received in both years, consolidated net income for 2003 was
$298 million ($.36 per share, diluted), as compared to 2002 net income of $216 million ($.27 per
share, diluted), an increase of $82 million, or 38.0 percent. The increase primarily was due to
overall higher demand for air travel in 2003, especially vacation travel. Operating income for
2003 was $523 million, an increase of $99 million, or 23.3 percent, compared to 2002.

OPERATING REVENUES Consolidated operating revenues increased $415 million, or 7.5 percent,
primarily due to a $400 million, or 7.5 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase in
passenger
revenues primarily was due to a 5.6 percent increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) flown.
Although the Company saw a disruption in revenue and bookings due to the threat of war and from the
subsequent conflict between the United States and Iraq during first half 2003, demand improved
following the war.

The increase in revenue passenger miles primarily was due to a 4.2 percent increase in added
capacity, as measured by available seat miles or ASMs. This was achieved through the Company’s net
addition of 13 aircraft during 2003 (net of four aircraft retirements). The Company’s improved
load factor for 2003 was 66.8 percent, compared to 65.9 percent for 2002. Passenger yields for
2003 were $.1197 compared to $.1177 in



2002, an increase of 1.7 percent, due to less fare
discounting in 2003 by the Company and the airline industry, in general.

Consolidated freight revenues increased $9 million, or 10.6 percent, primarily due to an increase
in freight and cargo units shipped. Other revenues increased $6 million, or 6.3 percent, primarily
due to an increase in commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business
partners, such as the Company-sponsored Chase® (formerly Bank One) Visa card.

OPERATING EXPENSES Consolidated operating expenses for 2003 increased $349 million, or 6.8
percent, compared to the 4.2 percent increase in capacity. To a large extent, changes in operating
expenses for airlines are driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents

%

Operating expenses per ASM increased 2.6 percent to $.0760, primarily due to increases in
salaries, profitsharing, and jet fuel prices, after hedging gains.

Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased 7.3 percent. Approximately 60 percent of
the increase was due to an increase in salaries and wages per ASM, primarily from increases in
average wage rates. The majority of the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in
Employee retirement plans expense per ASM, primarily from the increase in 2003 earnings and
resulting profitsharing.

Fuel and oil expense per ASM increased 4.5 percent, primarily due to a 6.3 percent increase in the
average jet fuel cost per gallon. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2003 was 72.3 cents
compared to 68.0 cents in 2002, excluding fuel-related taxes but including the effects of hedging
activities. The Company’s 2003 and 2002 average jet fuel costs are net of approximately $171
million and $45 million in gains from hedging activities, respectively. See Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM increased 5.3 percent primarily due to an increase in
engine maintenance. The Company outsources all of its heavy engine maintenance work.
Approximately half of the increase in engine maintenance expense was for 737-300 and 737-500
aircraft subject to a long-term maintenance contract, which is based on a contract rate charged per
hour flown. The majority of the increase in engine expense for these aircraft in 2003 was due to
an increase in the contract rate per hour flown, predicated on increased engine maintenance events.
The other half of the increase in engine maintenance expense was for 737-700 aircraft, which is
based on a time and materials basis. Expense for these aircraft engines increased due to the
growing number of this type of aircraft in the Company’s fleet.

Agency commissions per ASM decreased 12.5 percent, primarily due to a decline in commissionable
revenues. The percentage of commissionable revenues decreased from approximately 20 percent in
2002 to



approximately 16 percent in 2003. Approximately 54 percent of passenger revenues in 2003
were derived through the Company’s web site at

southwest.com

versus 49 percent in 2002. In October
2003, the Company announced it would no longer pay commissions on travel agency sales effective
December 15, 2003.

Aircraft rentals per ASM and depreciation and amortization expense per ASM were both impacted by a
higher percentage of the aircraft fleet being owned. Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 7.4
percent while depreciation and amortization expense per ASM increased 1.9 percent. The Company
owns all 17 of the aircraft it put into service during 2003. This, along with the retirement of
three owned and one leased aircraft, increased the Company’s percentage of aircraft owned or on
capital lease to 77 percent at December 31, 2003, from 76 percent at December 31, 2002.

Landing fees and other rentals per ASM increased 4.0 percent primarily as a result of higher space
rental rates throughout the Company’s system. During 2003, many other major airlines reduced their
flight capacity at airports served by the Company. Since Southwest did not reduce its flights, the
Company incurred higher airport costs based on a greater relative share of total flights and
passengers.

Other operating expenses per ASM decreased 6.8 percent. Approximately 70 percent of the decrease
was due to lower aviation insurance costs. As a result of more coverage from government insurance
programs and a more stable aviation insurance market, the Company was able to negotiate lower 2003
aviation insurance premiums compared to 2002. However, aviation insurance for 2003 was
substantially higher than before September 11, 2001. The majority of the remaining decrease in
other operating expenses per ASM was due to reductions in security costs from the transition of
airport security to the federal government, and decreases in advertising and personnel-related
expenses.

OTHER “Other expenses (income)” included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income,
and other gains and losses. Interest expense decreased $15 million, or 14.2 percent, compared to
the prior year, primarily due to lower effective interest rates. The Company executed two
interest-rate swaps in second quarter 2003 to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt to a lower
floating rate. The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its $385 million
6.5% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2012 and $375 million 5.496% Class A-2 pass-through
certificates due November 1, 2006. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more
information on the Company’s hedging activities. Capitalized interest increased $16 million, or
94.1 percent, primarily as a result of higher 2003 progress payment balances for scheduled future
aircraft deliveries, compared to 2002. Interest income decreased $13 million, or 35.1 percent,
primarily due to a decrease in rates earned on short-term investments. Other gains in 2003 and
2002 primarily resulted from government grants of $271 million and $48 million, respectively,
received pursuant to the Wartime and the Stabilization Acts. See Note 3 to the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these Acts.

INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased to
37.60 percent in 2003 from 38.64 percent in 2002 due to higher Company earnings in 2003 and lower
effective state income tax rates.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in 2004 compared to $1.3 billion in
2003. For the Company, operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air
transportation for Customers. The vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which
travel is provided and, in some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date. Operating
cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring expenses of operating the airline. For 2004,
the decrease in operating cash flows primarily was due to lower net income in 2004, largely
attributable to the $271 million government grant received in 2003, and an increase in “Accounts
and other receivables”. The increase in “Accounts and other receivables” was primarily due to the
$40 million debtor-in-possession loan made to ATA Airlines, Inc. (ATA), in December 2004 (see Note
2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and an increase in receivables from fuel hedge
counterparties from higher hedging gains recorded in fourth quarter 2004 versus fourth quarter
2003. These were partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities, primarily from higher
counterparty deposits associated with the Company’s fuel hedging program. For further information
on the Company’s hedging program and counterparty deposits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, and Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk,
respectively. Cash generated in 2004 and in 2003 primarily was used to finance aircraft-related
capital expenditures and to provide working capital.

Cash flows used in investing activities in 2004 totaled $1.9 billion compared to $1.2 billion in
2003. Investing activities in both years primarily consisted of payments for new 737-700 aircraft
delivered to the Company and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries. The Company
purchased 46 new 737-700 aircraft in 2004 (and leased one additional 737-700) versus the purchase
of 17 new 737-700s in 2003. However, progress payments for future deliveries were substantially
higher in 2003 than 2004, due to the fact that, during 2003, the Company accelerated the delivery
for several aircraft from future years into 2004, and exercised options for several 2004 and 2005
deliveries. These decisions resulted in an acceleration of progress payments to the manufacturer
related to the aircraft. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, in 2004, the
Company made an initial payment of $34 million for certain ATA assets, and provided ATA with $40
million in debtor-in-possession financing. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $133 million in 2004, primarily from the issuance of
$520 million in long-term debt. The majority of the debt issuance was the $350 million senior
unsecured notes issued in September 2004, and the fourth quarter 2004 issuance of $112 million in
floating-rate financing. The largest cash outflows in financing activities were from the Company’s
repurchase of $246 million of its common stock during 2004, and the redemption of long-term debt,
primarily the $175 million Aircraft Secured Notes that came due in November 2004. For 2003, net
cash used in financing activities was $48 million. Cash used primarily was for the redemption of
its $100 million senior unsecured 8 3/4% Notes originally issued in 1991. This was mostly offset by
proceeds of $93 million from the exercise of Employee stock options. See Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the issuance and redemption of long-term
debt.

The Company has various options available to meet its 2005 capital and operating commitments,
including cash on hand at December 31, 2004, of $1.3 billion, internally generated funds, and a
$575 million bank revolving line of credit. In addition, the Company will also consider various
borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements. The Company
believes it has access to a wide variety of financing arrangements because of its excellent credit
ratings, unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and consistent profitability.

The Company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of up to $650 million in
public debt securities and pass through certificates, which it may utilize for aircraft financings
or other purposes in the future. The Company currently expects that a portion of these securities
will be issued in 2005, primarily to replace debt that is coming due and to fund current fleet
growth plans.



OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

Southwest has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of
aircraft, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. Along with the receipt of 47 new 737-700
aircraft in 2004 (one of which is leased), the Company exercised its remaining options for aircraft
to be delivered in 2005, and several more options for aircraft to be delivered in 2006. The
following table details the Company’s current firm orders, options, and purchase rights for 737-700
aircraft:

Includes purchase rights

The Company has the option to substitute 737-600s or -800s for the -700s. This option is
applicable to aircraft ordered from the manufacturer and must be exercised two years prior to the
contractual delivery date.

The Company has engaged in off-balance sheet arrangements in the leasing of aircraft. The leasing
of aircraft provides flexibility to the Company effectively as a source of financing. Although the
Company is responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and expense associated with operating the
aircraft, and retains the risk of loss for leased aircraft, it has not made any guarantees to the
lessors regarding the residual value (or market value) of the aircraft at the end of the lease
terms.

As shown above and as disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company
operates 95 aircraft that it has leased from third parties, of which 88 are operating leases. As
prescribed by GAAP, assets and obligations under operating lease are not included in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the Company’s
leased aircraft are shown below as well as in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company currently expects that it will issue a portion of its $650 million in outstanding
shelf registrations for public debt securities during 2005.

There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2004. See
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

In January 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million
of the Company’s common stock, utilizing present and anticipated proceeds from the exercise of
Employee stock options. Repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the
open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. During
2004, the Company repurchased approximately 17.0 million of its common shares for a total of
approximately $246 million.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States
GAAP. The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the
Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes. The Company’s estimates and
assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment. However,
actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical
accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the
portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most subjective
judgments. The Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.

Revenue Recognition

As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, tickets sold for passenger air
travel are initially deferred as “Air traffic liability.” Passenger revenue is recognized and air
traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place).
“Air traffic liability” represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future
refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in “Air traffic
liability” fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity.
The Company’s “Air traffic liability” balance at December 31, 2004 was $529 million, compared to
$462 million as of December 31, 2003.

Estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded, exchanged, or forfeited involves some level
of subjectivity and judgment. The majority of the Company’s tickets sold are nonrefundable, which
is the primary source of forfeited tickets. According to the Company’s “Contract of Carriage”,
tickets that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight, up to a
year from the date of sale, or can be refunded (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage
of tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused. Fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited.
“Air traffic liability” includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges, net of
forfeitures, for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed. These estimates are based on historical experience over many years. The Company and
members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate
revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel is provided. Estimated future refunds and
exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on
subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the Company’s estimates with
respect to forfeited tickets.

Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical Customer travel
patterns, as noted, can result in actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeited tickets differing
significantly from estimates. The



Company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of
acceptable amounts. If actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeiture experience results in an amount
outside of this range, estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to “Air traffic
liability” and to “Passenger revenue” are recorded, as necessary. Additional factors that may
affect estimated refunds and exchanges include, but may not be limited to, the Company’s refund and
exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares, and promotional fare activity. The
Company’s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with
any estimates, actual refund, exchange, and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts.
Furthermore, the Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future
refunds, exchanges, and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions
or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time
estimates were made.

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $11.9 billion (at cost) of long-lived
assets, including $10.0 billion (at cost) in flight equipment and related assets. Flight equipment
primarily relates to the 329 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Company’s fleet at December 31, 2004, which
are either owned or on capital lease. The remaining 88 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Company’s fleet
at December 31, 2004, are on operating lease. In accounting for long-lived assets, the Company
must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of
the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash
flows they generate.

The following table shows a breakdown of the Company’s long-lived asset groups along with
information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups:

Estimated

2%-15

%

Aircraft parts

Fleet life


%

Ground property and equipment

5 to 30 years

0%-10

%

Leasehold improvements

5 years or lease term


%

In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the Company primarily has
relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from
Boeing, the manufacturer of the Company’s aircraft. Aircraft estimated useful lives are based on
the number of “cycles” flown (one take-off and landing). The Company has made a conversion of
cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft.
Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes to the Company’s maintenance
program, changes in utilization of the aircraft (actual cycles during a given period of time),
governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of
the same or similar types. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting
period and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments
are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense, as required
by GAAP.

When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment. Factors that would
indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the
market value of the long-lived asset(s), a significant change in the long-lived asset’s physical
condition, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset.
While the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators, Southwest has
continued to operate all of its aircraft, generate positive cash flow, and produce profits.
Consequently, the Company has not identified any impairments related to its



existing aircraft
fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its long-lived assets and the airline operating
environment.

The Company believes it unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives, expected
residual values, and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable
assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the
time estimates were made.

Financial Derivative Instruments

The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with
changing jet fuel prices, and accounts for them under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133). See
“Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more information on these risk
management activities and see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information
on SFAS 133, the Company’s fuel hedging program, and financial derivative instruments.

SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be marked to market (fair value) and recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2004, the Company was a party to over 300 financial
derivative instruments, related to fuel hedging, for the years 2005 through 2009. The fair value
of the Company’s fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004, was $796 million, compared to $251 million at
December 31, 2003. The large increase in fair value primarily was due to the dramatic increase in
energy prices throughout 2004, and the Company’s addition of derivative instruments to increase its
hedge positions in future years. Changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary
dramatically, as was evident during 2004, based on changes in the underlying commodity prices. The
financial derivative instruments utilized by the Company primarily are a combination of collars,
purchased call options, and fixed price swap agreements. The Company does not purchase or hold any
derivative instruments for trading purposes.

The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in
“over-the-counter” markets. Since the majority of the Company’s financial derivative instruments
are not traded on a market exchange, the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the
type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard
option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying
markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel, the Company must
estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging
instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required by SFAS 133. Forward jet fuel
prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as
crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline) and adjusted based on historical variations to those
like commodities.

Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated
prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle, and the time that jet fuel is
purchased and consumed, respectively. However, once settlement of the financial derivative
instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and prices are
known and are recognized in the financial statements. Based on these actual results once all
values and prices become known, the Company’s estimates have proved to be materially accurate.

Estimating the fair value of these fuel hedging derivatives and forward prices for jet fuel will
also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are
accounted for under SFAS 133. To the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel
hedging instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be
purchased, both on a cumulative and a period-to-period basis, ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can
result, as defined by SFAS 133. This could result in the immediate recording of charges or income,
even though the derivative instrument may not expire until a



future period. Historically, the
Company has not experienced significant ineffectiveness in its fuel hedges accounted for under SFAS
133, in relation to the fair value of the underlying financial derivative instruments.

SFAS 133 is a complex accounting standard with stringent requirements including the documentation
of a Company hedging strategy, statistical analysis to qualify a commodity for hedge accounting
both on a historical and a prospective basis, and strict contemporaneous documentation that is
required at the time each hedge is executed by the Company. As required by SFAS 133, the Company
assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis. The Company also
examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis utilizing statistical
analysis. This analysis involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses that compare
changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities used for hedging
purposes (crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline).

The Company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap
agreements. The primary objective for the Company’s use of interest rate hedges is to reduce the
volatility of net interest income by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities.
Concurrently, the Company’s interest rate hedges are also intended to take advantage of market
conditions in which short-term rates are significantly lower than the fixed longer term rates on
the Company’s long-term debt. During 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements
relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, and $375 million 5.496% Class
A-2 pass-through certificates due 2006. The floating rate paid under each agreement sets in
arrears. Under the first agreement, the Company pays the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
plus a margin every six months and receives 6.5% every six months on a notional amount of $385
million until 2012. The average floating rate paid under this agreement during 2004 is estimated to
be 4.490 percent based on actual and forward rates at December 31, 2004. Under the second
agreement, the Company pays LIBOR plus a margin every six months and receives 5.496% every six
months on a notional amount of $375 million until 2006. Based on actual and forward rates at
December 31, 2004, the average floating rate paid under this agreement during 2004 is estimated to
be 4.695 percent.

During 2004, the Company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement relating to its $350
million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014. Under this agreement, the Company pays LIBOR plus a
margin every six months and receives 5.25% every six months on a notional amount of $350 million
until 2014. The floating rate is set in advance. The average floating rate paid under this
agreement during 2004 was 2.814 percent.

The Company’s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133.
In addition, these interest rate swap agreements qualify for the “shortcut” method of accounting
for hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. Under the “shortcut” method, the hedges are assumed to be
perfectly effective, and, thus, there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings. The fair
value of the interest rate swap agreements, which are adjusted regularly, are recorded in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, as necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of
the long-term debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, excluding accrued
interest, at December 31, 2004, was a liability of approximately $16 million. This amount is
recorded in “Other deferred liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with
fair value hedging, the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value of
long-term debt. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of
financial derivative instruments, and forward jet fuel prices would be made or reported based on
other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data
available at the time estimates were made.



FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Some statements in this Form 10-K (or otherwise made by the Company or on the Company’s behalf from
time to time in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases,
conferences, World Wide Web postings or otherwise) which are not historical facts, may be
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include
statements about Southwest’s estimates, expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the
future, and the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements. Southwest uses the words
“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “forecasts,” “may,” “will,” “should,”
and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
historical experience or the Company’s present expectations. Factors that could cause these
differences include, but are not limited to:

•

Items directly linked to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks,
such as the adverse impact of new airline and airport security
directives on the Company’s costs and Customer demand for travel,
changes in the Transportation Security Administration’s scope for
managing U.S. airport security, the availability and cost of
war-risk and other aviation insurance, including the federal
government’s provision of third party war-risk coverage, and the
possibility of additional incidents that could cause the public to
question the safety and/or efficiency of air travel.

•

War or other military actions by the U.S. or others.

•

Competitive factors, such as fare sales and capacity decisions by
the Company and its competitors, changes in competitors’ flight
schedules, mergers and acquisitions, codesharing programs, and
airline bankruptcies.

•

General economic conditions, which could adversely affect the
demand for travel in general and consumer ticket purchasing
habits, as well as decisions by major freight Customers on how
they allocate freight deliveries among different types of
carriers.

•

Factors that could affect the Company’s ability to control its
costs, such as the results of Employee labor contract
negotiations, Employee hiring and retention rates, costs for
health care, the largely unpredictable prices of jet fuel, crude
oil, and heating oil, the continued effectiveness of the
Company’s fuel hedges, changes in the Company’s overall fuel hedging strategy, capacity
decisions by the Company and its competitors, unscheduled required aircraft airframe or engine
repairs and regulatory requirements, changes in commission policy, availability of capital
markets, future financing decisions made by the Company, and reliance on single suppliers for
both the Company’s aircraft and its aircraft engines.

•

Disruptions to operations due to adverse weather conditions and
air traffic control-related constraints.

•

Internal failures of technology or large-scale external
interruptions in technology infrastructure, such as power,
telecommunications, or the internet.

•

Risks involved with the Company’s acquisition of certain assets
from ATA Airlines, Inc. (ATA), including the ability to
efficiently utilize the rights to the leases acquired, and the
collectibility of loans made to ATA.

Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the Company’s forward-looking statements,
which represent the Company’s views only as of the date this report is filed. The Company
undertakes no



obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a
result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps, and
has commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet. The Company purchases
jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a
documented hedging strategy. Southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate
debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price
increases. The Company also operates 95 aircraft under operating and capital leases. However,
leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included
in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments related to leases are disclosed in
Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase or hold any
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on the Company’s accounting for its hedging program and for further
details on the Company’s financial derivative instruments.

Fuel hedging.

The Company utilizes its fuel hedges, on both a short-term and a long-term
basis, as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices. The Company believes
there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases. The
Company expects to consume 1.3 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2005. Based on this usage, a change
in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the Company’s “Fuel and oil expense” by
approximately $13 million per year.

The fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the Company’s jet fuel
market price risk at December 31, 2004, were net assets of $796 million. The current portion of
these financial derivative instruments, or $428 million, is classified as “Fuel hedge contracts” in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The long-term portion of these financial derivative instruments,
or $368 million, is included in “Other assets.” The fair values of the derivative instruments,
depending on the type of instrument, were determined by use of present value methods or standard
option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying
markets. An immediate ten- percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel-related commodity
prices from the December 31, 2004, prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the
commodity derivative instruments in place by
approximately $300 million. Changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may
change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well
as related income tax effects. This sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models
and holds all inputs constant at December 31, 2004, levels, except underlying futures prices.

Outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the Company to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not expect any
of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The credit exposure related to these
financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at
the reporting date. To manage credit risk, the Company selects and will periodically review
counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty, and monitors
the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. At
December 31, 2004, the Company had agreements with seven counterparties containing early
termination rights and/or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market
risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or credit ratings fall below certain levels. At
December 31, 2004, the Company held $330 million in cash collateral deposits, and another $150
million in U.S. Treasury Bills, under these bilateral collateral provisions. These collateral
deposits serve to decrease, but not totally eliminate, the credit risk associated with the
Company’s hedging program. The cash deposits are included in “Accrued liabilities” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In
accordance with SFAS 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments



of Liabilities”, the U.S. Treasury Bills, supplied as non-cash collateral by
counterparties, are not reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Financial market risk.

The vast majority of the Company’s assets are expensive aircraft,
which are long-lived. The Company’s strategy is to capitalize conservatively and grow capacity
steadily and profitably. While the Company uses financial leverage, it has maintained a strong
balance sheet and an “A” credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed-rate debt with Standard &
Poor’s and Fitch ratings agencies, and a “Baa1” credit rating with Moody’s rating agency. The
Company’s 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk
but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating-rate debt. In
addition, as disclosed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has
converted certain of its long-term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap
agreements. This includes the Company’s $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, the
$375 million 5.496% Class A-2 pass-through certificates due 2006, and the $350 million 5.25% senior
unsecured notes due 2014. Although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate
borrowings, the risk for the 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements is somewhat mitigated by the
fact that the Company may prepay this debt under certain conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the material terms of the Company’s
short-term and long-term debt.

Excluding the $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes, and the $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured
notes that were converted to a floating rate as previously noted, the Company had outstanding
senior unsecured notes totaling $300 million at December 31, 2004. These senior unsecured notes
currently have a weighted-average maturity of 8.3 years at fixed rates averaging 7.75 percent at
December 31, 2004, which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments
over the last ten years. The fixed-rate portion of the Company’s pass-through certificates
consists of its Class A certificates and Class B certificates, which totaled $174 million at
December 31, 2004. These Class A and Class B certificates had a weighted-average maturity of 1.5
years at fixed rates averaging 5.63 percent at December 31, 2004. The carrying value of the
Company’s floating rate debt totaled $1.2 billion, and this debt had a weighted-average maturity of
7.1 years at floating rates averaging 4.42 percent at December 31, 2004. In total, the Company’s
fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented 5.2 percent and 13.6 percent, respectively, of
total noncurrent assets at December 31, 2004.

The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short-term nature
of its invested cash, which totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2004. The Company invests
available cash in certificates of deposit, highly rated money markets, investment grade commercial
paper, and other highly rated financial instruments. Because of the short-term nature of these
investments, the returns earned parallel closely with short-term floating interest rates. The
Company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a
party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities.

A hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2004, would not have
a material effect on the fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt instruments. See Note 10 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the fair value of the Company’s
financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could, however, have a corresponding
effect on the Company’s earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt, invested
cash, and short-term investments because of the floating-rate nature of these items. Assuming
floating market rates in effect as of December 31, 2004, were held constant throughout a 12-month
period, a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the Company’s
net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than $2 million. Utilizing these
assumptions and considering the Company’s cash balance, short-term investments, and floating-rate
debt outstanding at December 31, 2004, an increase in rates would have a net positive effect on the
Company’s earnings and cash flows, while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on
the Company’s earnings and cash flows. However, a ten percent change in market rates would not
impact the Company’s earnings or cash flow associated with the Company’s publicly traded fixed-rate
debt.



The Company is also subject to various financial covenants included in its credit card transaction
processing agreement, the revolving credit facility, and outstanding debt agreements. Covenants
include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings. For the revolving credit facility, the Company
shall also maintain, at all times, a Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than
1.25 to 1.0. The Company met or exceeded the minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of
December 31, 2004. However, if conditions change and the Company fails to meet the minimum
standards set forth in the agreements, it could reduce the availability of cash under the
agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact as written.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest) is a major domestic airline that provides
point-to-point, low-fare service. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
Southwest and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the Company). All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash in excess of that necessary for operating requirements is invested
in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing investments. Investments with maturities of three
months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of certificates
of deposit, money market funds, and investment grade commercial paper issued by major corporations
and financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates
market value.

INVENTORIES Inventories of flight equipment expendable parts, materials, and supplies are carried
at average cost. These items are generally charged to expense when issued for use.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method to estimated residual
values over periods generally ranging from 20 to 25 years for flight equipment and 5 to 30 years
for ground property and equipment once the asset is placed in service. Residual values estimated
for aircraft are 15 percent, except for 737-200 aircraft, which were retired from the Company’s
fleet in January 2005. The estimated residual value for these aircraft is two percent, based on
current market values. Residual value percentages for ground property and equipment range from zero
to 10 percent. Property under capital leases and related obligations are recorded at an amount
equal to the present value of future minimum lease payments computed on the basis of the Company’s
incremental borrowing rate or, when known, the interest rate implicit in the lease. Amortization
of property under capital leases is on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in
depreciation expense.

In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the Company primarily has
relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from
Boeing, the manufacturer of the Company’s aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which
can be significant, could be caused by changes to the Company’s maintenance program, changes in
utilization of the aircraft (actual flight hours or cycles during a given period of time),
governmental regulations on aging aircraft, changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the
same or similar types, etc. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting
period and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments
are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense, as required
by GAAP.

When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment.
Impairment losses would be recorded when events and circumstances indicate that an asset might be
impaired and the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by that asset are less than the carrying
amounts of the asset. Factors that would indicate potential impairment include, but are not
limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived asset(s), a significant
change in the long-lived asset’s physical condition, operating or cash flow losses associated with
the use of the long-lived asset, etc.


While the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators, Southwest has
continued to operate all of its aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow.



AIRCRAFT AND ENGINE MAINTENANCE The cost of scheduled engine inspections and repairs and routine
maintenance costs for all aircraft and engines are charged to maintenance expense as incurred. For
the Company’s 737-200, 737-300, and 737-500 aircraft fleet types, scheduled airframe inspections
and repairs, known as D checks, are generally performed every ten years. Costs related to D checks
are capitalized and amortized over the estimated period benefited, presently the least of ten
years, the time until the next D check, or the remaining life of the aircraft. Modifications that
significantly enhance the operating performance or extend the useful lives of aircraft or engines
are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the asset.

The Company’s newest aircraft fleet type, the 737-700, is maintained under a different, more
efficient “next-generation” maintenance program. This program bundles tasks based on data gathered
relative to fleet performance. Scheduled maintenance is still performed at recommended intervals;
however, this program does not contain a D check. The costs of scheduled airframe inspections and
repairs under this maintenance program are expensed as incurred, as those expenses more readily
approximate the underlying scheduled maintenance tasks.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets primarily consist of rights to airport owned gates acquired by
the Company. These assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of
the lease.

REVENUE RECOGNITION Tickets sold are initially deferred as “Air traffic liability”. Passenger
revenue is recognized when transportation is provided. “Air traffic liability” primarily
represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated refunds and exchanges of tickets sold
for past travel dates. The majority of the Company’s tickets sold are nonrefundable. Tickets that
are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight, up to a year from the
date of sale, or refunded (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or partial
tickets) expire unused. The Company estimates the amount of future refunds and exchanges, net of
forfeitures, for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed. These estimates are based on
historical experience over many years. The Company and members of the airline industry have
consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date
travel is provided. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability
account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the
accuracy of the Company’s revenue recognition method with respect to forfeited tickets.

Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical Customer travel
patterns can result in actual refunds, exchanges or forfeited tickets differing significantly from
estimates; however, these differences have historically not been material. Additional factors that
may affect estimated refunds, exchanges, and forfeitures include, but may not be limited to, the
Company’s refund and exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares, and fare sale
activity. The Company’s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year;
however, as with any estimates, actual refund and exchange activity may vary from estimated
amounts.

Subsequent to third quarter 2001 and through second quarter 2002, the Company experienced a higher
than historical mix of discount, nonrefundable ticket sales. The Company also experienced changes
in Customer travel patterns resulting from various factors, including new airport security
measures, concerns about further terrorist attacks, and an uncertain economy. Consequently, the
Company recorded $36 million in additional passenger revenue in second quarter 2002 as Customers
required fewer refunds and exchanges, resulting in more forfeited tickets. During 2003 and 2004,
refund, exchange, and forfeiture activity returned to more historic, pre-September 11, 2001,
patterns.

FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM The Company accrues the estimated incremental cost of providing free
travel for awards earned under its Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program. The Company also sells
frequent flyer credits and related services to companies participating in its Rapid Rewards
frequent flyer program. Funds



received from the sale of flight segment credits and associated with
future travel are deferred and recognized as “Passenger revenue” when the ultimate free travel
awards are flown or the credits expire unused.

ADVERTISING The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Advertising expense for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 was $158 million, $155 million, and $156 million,
respectively.

STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION The Company has stock-based compensation plans covering the
majority of its Employee groups, including a plan covering the Company’s Board of Directors and
plans related to employment contracts with certain Executive Officers of the Company. The Company
accounts for stock-based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” and related Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for
fixed option plans because the exercise prices of Employee stock options equal or exceed the market
prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Compensation expense for other stock options
is not material.

The following table represents the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had
applied the fair value based method and recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, to stock-based Employee
compensation:

As required, the pro forma disclosures above include options granted since January 1, 1995. For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation plans and
other options is amortized to expense primarily over the vesting period. See Note 13 for further
discussion of the Company’s stock-based Employee compensation.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”. SFAS No. 123R is a
revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation”, and supersedes APB 25. Among
other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of APB 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting,
and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards
of equity



instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial
statements. The effective date of SFAS 123R is the first reporting period beginning after June 15,
2005, which is third quarter 2005 for calendar year companies, although early adoption is allowed.
SFAS 123R permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a “modified prospective” method,
or a “modified retrospective” method. Under the “modified prospective” method, compensation cost
is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the
requirements of SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on the
requirements of SFAS 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R.
Under the “modified retrospective” method, the requirements are the same as under the “modified
prospective” method, but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods
based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with SFAS 123.

The Company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model (i.e., Black-Scholes) to measure the
fair value of stock options granted to Employees. While SFAS 123R permits entities to continue to
use such a model, the standard also permits the use of a “lattice” model. The Company has not yet
determined which model it will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the
adoption of SFAS 123R. See Note 13 for further information.

SFAS 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of
recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash
flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows
and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date. These future amounts
cannot be estimated, because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock
options. However, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess
tax deductions, as shown in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, were $35 million,
$41 million, and $38 million, respectively, for 2004, 2003, and 2002.

The Company currently expects to adopt SFAS 123R effective July 1, 2005; however, the Company has
not yet determined which of the aforementioned adoption methods it
will use. Subject to a complete review of the requirements of SFAS
123R, based on stock
options granted to Employees through December 31, 2004, and stock options expected to be granted
during 2005, the Company expects that the adoption of SFAS 123R on July 1, 2005, would reduce both
third quarter 2005 and fourth quarter 2005 net earnings by approximately $10 million ($.01 per
share, diluted) each. See Note 13 for further information on the Company’s stock-based
compensation plans.

FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company accounts for financial derivative instruments
utilizing Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133), “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended. The Company utilizes various
derivative instruments, including both crude oil and heating oil-based derivatives, to hedge a
portion of its exposure to jet fuel price increases. These instruments primarily consist of
purchased call options, collar structures, and fixed-price swap agreements, and are accounted for
as cash-flow hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. The Company has also entered into interest rate swap
agreements to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt to floating rates. These interest rate
hedges are accounted for as fair value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133.

Since the majority of the Company’s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market
exchange, the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of instrument, the values
are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions
about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Also, since there is not a
reliable forward market for jet fuel,
the Company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of
the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required by SFAS 133. Forward
jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as
crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline) and adjusted based on historical variations to those
like commodities. See Note 10 for further information on SFAS 133 and financial derivative
instruments.



INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for deferred income taxes utilizing Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), “Accounting for Income Taxes”, as amended. SFAS 109
requires an asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statements and the tax
bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. When appropriate, in
accordance with SFAS 109, the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to reduce
deferred tax assets.

2. ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN ASSETS

In fourth quarter 2004, Southwest was selected as the winning bidder at a bankruptcy-court approved
auction for certain ATA Airlines, Inc. (ATA) assets. As part of the transaction, which was
approved in December 2004, Southwest agreed to pay $40 million for certain ATA assets, consisting
of the rights to six of ATA’s leased Chicago Midway Airport gates and the rights to a leased
aircraft maintenance hangar at Chicago Midway Airport. An initial payment of $34 million in
December 2004 is classified as an intangible asset and is included in “Other assets” in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, Southwest provided ATA with $40 million in
debtor-in-possession financing while ATA remains in bankruptcy, and has also guaranteed the
repayment of an ATA construction loan to the City of Chicago for $7 million. The $40 million
debtor-in-possession financing, which will mature no later than September 30, 2005, is classified
as “Accounts and other receivables” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the estimated fair value
of the Company’s guarantee of the ATA construction loan, which is not material, is classified as
part of “Other deferred liabilities”. The debtor-in-possession financing bears interest at a rate
equal to the higher of 8 percent or LIBOR plus 5 percent, and interest is payable to Southwest
monthly.

Southwest and ATA also agreed on a code share arrangement, which was approved by the Department of
Transportation in January 2005. Under the agreement, each carrier can exchange passengers on
certain designated flights at Chicago’s Midway Airport. Sales of the code share flights began
January 16, 2005, with travel dates beginning February 4, 2005.

Upon ATA’s emergence from bankruptcy, Southwest has committed to convert the debtor-in-possession
financing to a term loan, payable over five years. Additionally, Southwest has committed to invest
$30 million in cash into ATA convertible preferred stock, which would represent 27.5 percent of the
new ATA. The stock will be nonvoting, and it is the Company’s intent to liquidate those shares in
an orderly manner over time.

3. FEDERAL GRANTS

As a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, President Bush signed into law the Air
Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (Stabilization Act). The Stabilization Act
provided for up to $5 billion in cash grants to qualifying U.S. airlines and freight carriers to
compensate for direct and incremental losses, as defined in the Stabilization Act, from September
11, 2001, through December 31, 2001, associated with the terrorist attacks. Each airline’s total
eligible grant was determined based on that airline’s percentage of available seat miles (ASMs)
during August 2001 to total eligible carriers’ ASMs for August 2001, less an amount set aside for
eligible carriers for whom the use of an ASM formula would result in an insufficient representation
of their share of direct and incremental losses.

In 2001, the Department of Transportation (DOT) made a determination of the amount of eligible
direct and incremental losses incurred by Southwest, and the Company was allotted 100 percent of
its eligible grants, totaling $283 million. The Company recognized $235 million in “Other gains”
from grants under the Stabilization Act during the second half of 2001 and recognized an additional
$48 million as “Other gains” from grants under the Stabilization Act in third quarter 2002
coincident with the receipt of its final payment. Representatives of the DOT or other governmental
agencies may perform additional audit and/or review(s) of the Company’s previously submitted final
application, although no reviews had been performed as of December 31, 2004. While the
Stabilization Act is subject to significant interpretation as to what constitutes



direct and
incremental losses, management believes the Company’s eligible direct and incremental losses are
sufficient to retain 100 percent of its eligible grant following additional audits or reviews,
should they occur.

On April 16, 2003, as a result of the United States war with Iraq, the Emergency Wartime
Supplemental Appropriations Act (Wartime Act) was signed into law. Among other items, the
legislation included a $2.3 billion government grant for airlines. Southwest received $271 million
as its proportional share of the grant during second quarter 2003. This amount is included in
“Other (gains) losses” in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statement for 2003. Also as part
of the Wartime Act, the Company received approximately $5 million as a reimbursement for the direct
cost of reinforcing cockpit doors on all of the Company’s aircraft. The Company accounted for this
reimbursement as a reduction of capitalized property and equipment.

4. COMMITMENTS

The Company’s contractual purchase commitments primarily consist of scheduled aircraft acquisitions
from Boeing. The Company has contractual purchase commitments with Boeing for 34 737-700 aircraft
deliveries in 2005, 26 scheduled for delivery in 2006, 25 in 2007, and 6 in 2008. In addition, the
Company has options and purchase rights for an additional 259 737-700s that it may acquire during
2006-2012. The Company has the option, which must be exercised two years prior to the contractual
delivery date, to substitute 737-600s or 737-800s for the 737-700s. As of December 31, 2004,
aggregate funding needed for firm commitments is approximately $2.3 billion, subject to adjustments
for inflation, due as follows: $920 million in 2005, $709 million in 2006, $523 million in 2007,
and $105 million in 2008.

In November 2001, in response to decreased demand for air travel following the terrorist attacks,
the Company modified its schedule for future aircraft deliveries to defer the acquisition of 19 new
737-700 aircraft that were either already in production at Boeing or were scheduled to be built
through April 2002. The Company accomplished this by entering into a trust arrangement with a
special purpose entity (the Trust) and assigned its purchase agreement with Boeing to the Trust
with respect to the 19 aircraft originally scheduled for delivery between September 2001 and April
2002. Southwest subsequently entered into a purchase agreement with the Trust to purchase the
aircraft at new delivery dates from January 2002 to April 2003. The Trust was formed to facilitate
the financing of the Company’s near-term aircraft purchase obligations with Boeing. The Trust
purchased 11 of the aircraft in 2001 and eight aircraft in 2002. For these 19 Trust aircraft, the
Company recorded the associated assets (“Flight equipment”) and liabilities (“Aircraft purchase
obligations”) in its financial statements as the aircraft were completed by Boeing and delivered to
the Trust. In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Trust’s receipt of these aircraft was
recorded as “Purchases of property and equipment” and “Proceeds from trust arrangement.” During
2002, the Company accelerated the deliveries from the Trust and accepted delivery of all 19
aircraft, thereby terminating the Trust. The receipt of the aircraft from the Trust was reflected
in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as “Payments of trust arrangement”. The cost of
financing these aircraft obligations, approximately $5 million, was expensed.

6. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

Following the terrorist attacks in September 2001, the Company borrowed the full $475 million
available under its unsecured revolving credit line with a group of banks. Borrowings under the
credit line bore interest at six-month LIBOR plus 15.5 basis points. The Company repaid this
unsecured revolving credit line in full, plus accrued interest, in March 2002. This credit
facility was replaced in April 2002.

During second quarter 2004, the Company replaced its former revolving credit facilities with a new
facility. Under the new facility, the Company can borrow up to $575 million from a group of banks.
The facility expires in April 2007 and is unsecured. At the Company’s option, interest on the
facility can be calculated on one of several different bases. For most borrowings, Southwest would
anticipate choosing a floating rate based upon LIBOR. If fully drawn, the spread over LIBOR would
be 75 basis points given Southwest’s credit rating at December 31, 2004. The facility also
contains a financial covenant requiring a minimum coverage ratio of adjusted pretax income to fixed
obligations, as defined. As of December 31, 2004, the Company is in compliance with this covenant,
and there are no outstanding amounts borrowed under this facility.

In November 2004, the Company redeemed its remaining $175 million of floating rate Aircraft Secured
Notes originally issued in 1999.

In fourth quarter 2004, the Company entered into four identical 13-year floating-rate financing
arrangements, whereby it borrowed a total of $112 million from French banking partnerships.
Although the interest on the borrowings are at floating rates, the Company estimates that,
considering the full effect of the “net present value benefits” included in the transactions, the
effective economic yield over the 13-year term of the loans will be approximately LIBOR minus 45
basis points. Principal and interest are payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 31 for each
of the loans, and the Company may terminate the arrangements in any year on either of those dates,
with certain conditions. The Company has pledged four aircraft as collateral for the transactions.



In September 2004, the Company issued $350 million senior unsecured Notes (Notes) due 2014. The
Notes bear interest at 5.25 percent, payable semi-annually in arrears, with the first payment due
on April 1, 2005. Concurrently, the Company entered into an interest-rate swap agreement to convert
this fixed-rate debt to a floating rate. See Note 10 for more information on the interest-rate
swap agreement. Southwest used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, approximately $346
million, for general corporate purposes.

In February 2004 and April 2004, the Company issued two separate $29 million two-year notes, each
secured by one new 737-700 aircraft. Both of the notes are non-interest bearing and accrete to
face value at maturity at annual rates of 2.9 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively. The proceeds
of these borrowings were used to fund the individual aircraft purchases.

On March 1, 2002, the Company issued $385 million senior unsecured Notes (Notes) due March 1, 2012.
The Notes bear interest at 6.5 percent, payable semi-annually beginning on September 1, 2002.
Southwest used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, approximately $380 million, for
general corporate purposes, including the repayment of the Company’s credit facility in March 2002.
See Note 6. During 2003, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement relating to
these Notes. See Note 10 for further information.

On October 30, 2001, the Company issued $614 million Pass Through Certificates consisting of $150
million 5.1% Class A-1 certificates, $375 million 5.5% Class A-2 certificates, and $89 million 6.1%
Class B certificates. A separate trust was established for each class of certificates. The trusts
used the proceeds from the sale of certificates to acquire equipment notes, which were issued by
Southwest on a full recourse basis. Payments on the equipment notes held in each trust will be
passed through to the holders of certificates of such trust. The equipment notes were issued for
each of 29 Boeing 737-700 aircraft owned by Southwest and are secured by a mortgage on such
aircraft. Interest on the equipment notes held for the certificates is payable semiannually,
beginning May 1, 2002. Beginning May 1, 2002, principal payments on the equipment notes held for
the Class A-1 certificates are due semiannually until the balance of the certificates mature on May
1, 2006. The entire principal of the equipment notes for the Class A-2 and Class B certificates
are scheduled for payment on November 1, 2006. During 2003, the Company entered into an interest
rate swap agreement relating to the $375 million 5.5% Class A-2 certificates. See Note 10 for
further information.

In fourth quarter 1999, the Company entered into two identical 13-year floating rate financing
arrangements, whereby it borrowed a total of $56 million from French banking partnerships. Although
the interest on the borrowings are at floating rates, the Company estimates that, considering the
full effect of the “net present value benefits” included in the transactions, the effective
economic yield over the 13-year term of the loans will be approximately LIBOR minus 67 basis
points. Principal and interest are payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 31 for each of
the loans and the Company may terminate the arrangements in any year on either of those dates, with
certain conditions. The Company pledged two aircraft as collateral for the transactions.

On February 28, 1997, the Company issued $100 million of senior unsecured 7 3/8% Debentures due
March 1, 2027. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. The Debentures may
be redeemed, at the option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a
redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the Debentures plus accrued
interest at the date of redemption or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
payments of principal and interest thereon, discounted to the date of redemption at the comparable
treasury rate plus 20 basis points, plus accrued interest at the date of redemption.

During 1995, the Company issued $100 million of senior unsecured 8% Notes due March 1, 2005.
Interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. The Notes are not redeemable prior
to maturity.



During 1992, the Company issued $100 million of senior unsecured 7 7/8% Notes due September 1,
2007. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. The Notes are not redeemable
prior to maturity.

The net book value of the assets pledged as collateral for the Company’s secured borrowings,
primarily aircraft and engines, was $889 million at December 31, 2004.

As of December 31, 2004, aggregate annual principal maturities (not including amounts associated
with interest rate swap agreements, and interest on capital leases) for the five-year period ending
December 31, 2009, were $146 million in 2005, $604 million in 2006, $120 million in 2007, $22
million in 2008, $24 million in 2009, and $960 million thereafter.

Company’s terminal operations space, as well as 88 aircraft, were under operating leases at
December 31, 2004. Future minimum lease payments under capital leases and noncancelable operating
leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2004, were:

end of the lease term at fair market value, generally limited to a stated percentage of the
lessor’s defined cost of the aircraft.



9. CONSOLIDATION OF RESERVATIONS CENTERS

In November 2003, the Company announced the consolidation of its nine Reservations Centers into
six, effective February 28, 2004. This decision was made in response to the established shift by
Customers to the internet as a preferred way of booking travel. The Company’s website,

southwest.com

, now accounts for more than half of ticket bookings and, as a consequence, demand for
phone contact has dramatically decreased. During first quarter 2004, the Company closed its
Reservations Centers located in Dallas, Texas, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Little Rock, Arkansas.
The Company provided the 1,900 affected Employees at these locations the opportunity to relocate to
another of the Company’s remaining six centers. Those Employees choosing not to relocate,
approximately 55% of the total affected, were offered support packages, which included severance
pay, flight benefits, medical coverage, and job-search assistance, depending on length of service
with the Company. The total cost associated with the Reservations Center consolidation, recognized
in first quarter 2004, was approximately $18 million. Employee severance and benefit costs were
reflected in “Salaries, wages, and benefits,” and the majority of other costs in “Other operating
expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The breakdown of the costs incurred and a

10. DERIVATIVE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fuel contracts

- Airline operators are inherently dependent upon energy to operate and,
therefore, are impacted by changes in jet fuel prices. Jet fuel and oil consumed in 2004, 2003,
and 2002 represented approximately 16.7 percent, 15.2 percent, and 14.9 percent of Southwest’s
operating expenses, respectively. The Company endeavors to acquire jet fuel at the lowest possible
cost. Because jet fuel is not traded on an organized futures exchange, liquidity for hedging is
limited. However, the Company has found that crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline
contracts are effective commodities for hedging jet fuel. The Company has financial derivative
instruments in the form of the types of hedges it utilizes to decrease its exposure to jet fuel
price increases. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes.

The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments for both short-term and long-term time frames
when it appears the Company can take advantage of market conditions. As of December 31, 2004, the
Company had a mixture of purchased call options, collar structures, and fixed price swap agreements
in place to hedge its total anticipated jet fuel requirements, at crude oil equivalent prices, for
the following periods: 85 percent for 2005 at approximately $26 per barrel, 65 percent for 2006 at
approximately $32 per barrel, over 45 percent for 2007 at approximately $31 per barrel, 30 percent
in 2008 at approximately $33 per barrel, and over 25 percent for 2009 at approximately $35 per
barrel. As of December 31, 2004, the majority of the Company’s first quarter 2005 hedges are
effectively heating oil-based positions in the form of option contracts. For the remainder of
2005, the majority of the Company’s hedge positions are effectively in the form of unleaded
gasoline-based and heating oil-based option contracts. The majority of the remaining hedge
positions are crude oil-based positions.

Under the rules established by SFAS 133, the Company is required to record all financial derivative instruments on its balance sheet
at fair value; however, not all instruments necessarily qualify for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value
through income. If a derivative is



designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge,
changes in its fair value that are considered to be effective, as defined, either offset the change
in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or are
recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” until the hedged item is recorded in
earnings. Any portion of a change in a derivative’s fair value that is considered to be
ineffective, as defined, is recorded immediately in “Other (gains) losses, net” in the Consolidated
Statement of Income. See Note 11 for further information on Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). Any portion of a change in a derivative’s fair value that the Company elects to exclude
from its measurement of effectiveness is required to be recorded immediately in earnings.

The Company primarily uses financial derivative instruments to
hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases and accounts for these derivatives as cash flow
hedges, as defined. In accordance with SFAS 133, the Company must comply with detailed rules and
strict documentation requirements prior to beginning hedge accounting. As required by SFAS 133,
the Company assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis. The
Company also examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis
utilizing statistical analysis. This analysis involves utilizing regression and other statistical
analyses that compare changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities
used for hedging purposes (crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline). If a derivative
instrument does not qualify for hedge accounting, as defined by SFAS 133, any change in fair value
of that derivative instrument is recorded immediately in earnings.

During 2004, the Company recognized $13 million in additional expense in “Other (gains) losses,
net”, related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges. During 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized
$16 million and $5 million, in additional income, respectively, in “Other (gains) losses, net”,
related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges. During 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company recognized
approximately $24 million, $29 million, and $26 million, respectively, of net expense, related to
amounts excluded from the Company’s measurements of hedge effectiveness, in “Other (gains) losses,
net”. Hedge accounting, as administered
according to SFAS 133, generally results in more volatility in the Company’s financial statements
than prior to its adoption, due to the changes in market values of derivative instruments and some
ineffectiveness that has been experienced in fuel hedges.

During 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company recognized gains in “Fuel and oil” expense of $455
million, $171 million, and $45 million, respectively, from hedging activities. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, approximately $51 million and $19 million, respectively, due from third parties from
expired derivative contracts, is included in “Accounts and other receivables” in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the Company’s financial derivative instruments at
December 31, 2004, was a net asset of approximately $796 million. The current portion of these
financial derivative instruments is classified as “Fuel hedge contracts” and the long-term portion
is classified as “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the derivative
instruments, depending on the type of instrument, was determined by the use of present value
methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those
observed in underlying markets.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $416 million in unrealized gains, net of
tax, in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” related to fuel hedges. Included in this
total are approximately $246 million in net unrealized gains that are expected to be realized in
earnings during 2005.

Interest Rate Swaps

- During 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements
relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012 and $375 million 5.496% Class A-2
pass-through certificates due 2006. The floating rate paid under each agreement is set in arrears.
Under the first agreement, the Company pays the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a
margin every six months and receives 6.5% every six months on a notional amount of $385 million
until 2012. The average floating rate paid under this agreement during 2004 is estimated to be
4.490 percent based on actual and forward rates at December 31,



2004. Under the second agreement,
the Company pays LIBOR plus a margin every six months and receives 5.496% every six months on a
notional amount of $375 million until 2006. Based on actual and forward rates at December 31,
2004, the average floating rate paid under this agreement during 2004 is estimated to be 4.695
percent.

During 2004, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement relating to its $350 million
5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014. Under this agreement, the Company pays LIBOR plus a margin
every six months and receives 5.25% every six months on a notional amount of $350 million until
2014. The floating rate is set in advance. The average floating rate paid under this agreement
during 2004 was 2.814 percent.

The primary objective for the Company’s use of interest rate hedges is to reduce the volatility of
net interest income by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities. Concurrently,
the Company’s interest rate hedges are also intended to take advantage of market conditions in
which short-term rates are significantly lower than the fixed longer term rates on the Company’s
long-term debt. The Company’s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges, as
defined by SFAS 133. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, which are adjusted
regularly, are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as necessary, with a corresponding
adjustment to the carrying value of the long-term debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap
agreements, excluding accrued interest, at December 31, 2004, was a liability of approximately $16
million. This amount is recorded in “Other deferred liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. In accordance with fair value hedging, the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease
the carrying value of long-term debt. See Note 7.

Outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the Company to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not expect any
of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The credit exposure related to these
financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at
the reporting date. To manage credit risk, the Company selects and periodically reviews counterparties based on credit ratings, limits
its exposure to a single counterparty, and monitors the market position of the program and its
relative market position with each counterparty. At December 31, 2004, the Company had agreements
with seven counterparties containing early termination rights and/or bilateral collateral
provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold
amount or credit ratings fall below certain levels. At December 31, 2004, the Company held $330
million in cash collateral deposits and $150 million in U.S. Treasury Bills, under these bilateral
collateral provisions. These collateral deposits serve to decrease, but not totally eliminate, the
credit risk associated with the Company’s hedging program. The cash deposits are included in
“Accrued liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are included as “Operating cash flows”
in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In accordance with SFAS 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities”, the U.S. Treasury
Bills, supplied as non-cash collateral by counterparties, are not reflected on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet.



The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s long-term debt at December 31, 2004
were as follows:

The estimated fair values of the Company’s publicly held long-term debt were based on quoted
market prices. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their fair
value.

11. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

Comprehensive income includes changes in the fair value of certain financial derivative
instruments, which qualify for hedge accounting, and unrealized gains and losses on certain
investments. Comprehensive income totaled $608 million, $510 million, and $327 million for 2004,
2003, and 2002, respectively. The differences between “Net income” and “Comprehensive income” for
these years are as follows:

12. COMMON STOCK

The Company has one class of common stock. Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to
receive dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors and are entitled to one vote per
share on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders. At December 31, 2004, the Company
had 241 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to Employee stock benefit
plans (of which 43 million shares have not yet been granted.)

In January 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million
of the Company’s common stock, utilizing present and anticipated proceeds from the exercise of
Employee stock options. Repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in
the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions.
During 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 17.0 million of its common shares for a total of
approximately $246 million.

13. STOCK PLANS

The Company has stock plans covering Employees subject to collective bargaining agreements
(collective bargaining plans) and stock plans covering Employees not subject to collective
bargaining agreements (other Employee plans). None of the collective bargaining plans were
required to be approved by shareholders. Options granted to Employees under collective bargaining
plans are granted at or above the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of
grant, and generally have terms ranging from six to twelve years. Vesting terms differ based on
the grant made, and have ranged in length from immediate vesting to vesting periods in accordance
with the period covered by the respective collective bargaining agreement. Neither Executive
Officers nor members of the Company’s Board of Directors are eligible to participate in any of
these collective bargaining plans. Options granted to Employees through other Employee plans are
granted at the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, have ten-year
terms, and vest and become fully exercisable over three, five, or ten years of continued
employment, depending upon the grant type. All of the options included under the heading of “Other
Employee Plans” have been approved by shareholders, except the plan covering non-management,
non-contract Employees, which had 6.8 million options outstanding to purchase the Company’s common
stock as of December 31, 2004.

Under the amended 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which has been approved by
shareholders, as of December 31, 2004, the Company is authorized to issue up to a remaining balance
of 3.5 million shares of common stock to Employees of the Company. These shares may be issued at a
price equal to 90 percent of the market value at the end of each purchase period. Common stock
purchases are paid for through periodic payroll deductions. Participants under the plan received
1.5 million shares in 2004, 1.4 million shares in 2003, and 1.4 million shares in 2002, at average
prices of $13.47, $14.04, and $14.70, respectively. The weighted-average fair value of each
purchase right under the ESPP granted in 2004, 2003, and 2002, which is equal to the ten percent
discount from the market value of the common stock at the end of each purchase period, was $1.50,
$1.56, and $1.63, respectively.



Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share, as disclosed in Note 1, has
been determined as if the Company had accounted for its Employee stock-based compensation plans and
other stock options under the fair value method of SFAS 123. The fair value of each option grant
is estimated on the date of grant using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions used for grants under the fixed option plans:




Wtd-average risk-free interest rate

3.1

%

%

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including
expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s Employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its Employee stock
options. See Note 1 for information on the use of alternative valuation methods allowed by SFAS
123R.

The fair value of options granted under the fixed option plans during 2004 ranged from $3.45 to
$7.83. The fair value of options granted under the fixed option plans during 2003 ranged from $3.33
to $8.17. The fair value of options granted under the fixed option plans during 2002 ranged from
$3.54 to $8.52.

14. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS

Defined contribution plans

The Company has defined contribution plans covering substantially all Southwest Employees. The
Southwest Airlines Co. Profitsharing Plan is a money purchase defined contribution plan and
Employee stock purchase plan. The Company also sponsors Employee savings plans under section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which include Company matching contributions. The 401(k)
plans cover substantially all Employees. Contributions under all defined contribution plans are
primarily based on Employee compensation and performance of the Company.

Company contributions to all retirement plans expensed in 2004, 2003, and 2002 were $200 million,
$219 million, and $156 million, respectively.

Postretirement benefit plans

The Company provides postretirement benefits to qualified retirees in the form of medical and
dental coverage. Employees must meet minimum levels of service and age requirements as set forth
by the Company, or as specified in collective bargaining agreements with specific workgroups.
Employees meeting these requirements, as defined, may use accrued sick time to pay for medical and
dental premiums from the age of retirement until age 65.



The following table shows the change in the Company’s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
(APBO) for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003:

During first quarter 2004, the Company closed its Reservations Centers located in Dallas, Texas,
Salt Lake City, Utah, and Little Rock, Arkansas. In excess of 1,000 Employees at these locations
did not elect to relocate to the Company’s remaining centers, and instead accepted severance
packages offered by the Company. See Note 9 for further information. Also during 2004, the
Company offered an early-out option to substantially all Employees, primarily in an effort to
alleviate overstaffing in certain areas of the Company. As a result of the reduction in headcount
associated with these events, the Company remeasured its benefit obligation, resulting in the 2004
gain.

The assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the
Company’s plan. A one-percent change in all healthcare cost trend rates used in measuring the APBO
at December 31, 2004, would have the following effects:

The Company’s plans are unfunded, and benefits are paid as they become due. For the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, both benefits paid and Company contributions to the plans were $1
million in each year. Estimated future benefit payments expected to be paid for each of the next
five years are $2 million in 2005, $3 million in 2006, $5 million in 2007, $7 million in 2008, $9
million in 2009, and $78 million for the next five years thereafter.

The following table shows the calculation of the accrued postretirement benefit cost recognized in
“Other deferred liabilities” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2004 and

Unrecognized prior service cost is expensed using a straight-line amortization of the cost over the

15. INCOME TAXES

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income
tax purposes. The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
are as follows:

For the year 2004, Southwest Airlines Co. had a tax net operating loss of $612 million for
federal income tax purposes. The Company estimates that a federal tax refund will be realized as a
result of utilizing a portion of this net operating loss as a carryback to prior taxable years.
This refund, estimated at $35 million at December 31, 2004, is included in “Accounts and other
receivables” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remainder of the tax benefit related to the
year 2004 federal net operating loss is carried forward to future years, and expires in 2024.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regularly examines the Company’s federal income tax returns
and, in the course of which, may propose adjustments to the Company’s federal income tax liability
reported on such returns. It is the Company’s practice to vigorously contest those proposed
adjustments that it deems lacking of merit. The Company’s management does not expect that the
outcome of any proposed adjustments presented to date by the IRS, individually or collectively,
will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or
cash flows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southwest Airlines Co. as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Southwest Airlines Co. at December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Southwest
Airlines Co.'s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control
- - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 2, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Southwest Airlines Co. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Southwest Airlines’ management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Southwest Airlines Co. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Southwest Airlines Co. maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on the COSO criteria

.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Southwest Airlines Co. as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholder’s equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 of Southwest Airlines Co.
and our report dated February 2, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The Company maintains controls and procedures designed to
ensure that it is able to collect the information it is required to disclose in the reports it
files with the SEC, and to process, summarize and disclose this information within the time periods
specified in the rules of the SEC. Based on an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report conducted by the Company’s
management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, the Chief
Executive and Chief Financial Officers believe that these controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that the Company is able to collect, process and disclose the information it is required to
disclose in the reports it files with the SEC within the required time periods.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Management of the Company is
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as
defined in



Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s
management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control

–

Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2004,
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Directors
and Executive Officers of the Registrant

The information required by Item 401 of Regulation S-K regarding directors is included under
“Election of Directors” in the definitive Proxy Statement for Southwest’s Annual Meeting of
Shareholders to be held May 18, 2005, and is incorporated herein by reference. The information
required by Item 401 of Regulation S-K regarding executive officers is included under “Executive
Officers of the Registrant” in Part I following Item 4 of this Report. The information required by
Item 405 of Regulation S-K is included under “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting
Compliance” in the definitive Proxy Statement for Southwest’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be
held May 18, 2005, and is incorporated herein by reference.

In the wake of well-publicized corporate scandals, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the New York Stock Exchange have issued multiple new regulations, requiring the implementation of
policies and procedures in the corporate governance area. Since beginning business in 1971,
Southwest has thrived on a culture that encourages an entrepreneurial spirit in its Employees, and
has emphasized personal responsibility, initiative, and the use of independent, good judgment. The
Golden Rule is one of the core values, and there is a “top-down” insistence on the highest ethical
standards at all times.

In complying with new regulations requiring the institution of policies and procedures, it has
been the goal of Southwest’s Board of Directors and senior leadership to do so in a way which does
not inhibit or constrain Southwest’s unique culture, and which does not unduly impose a bureaucracy
of forms and checklists. Accordingly, formal, written policies and procedures have been adopted in
the simplest possible way, consistent with legal requirements. The Company’s Corporate Governance
Guidelines, its
charters for each of its Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committees and its Code of Ethics covering all Employees are available on the Company’s website,
www.southwest.com, and a copy will be mailed upon request to Manager — Investor Relations,
Southwest Airlines Co., P.O. Box 36611, Dallas, TX 75235. The Company intends to disclose any
amendments to or waivers of the Code of Ethics on



behalf of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and persons performing similar functions on the Company’s
website, at southwest.com, under the “About SWA” caption, promptly following the date of such
amendment or waiver.
