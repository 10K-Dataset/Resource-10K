Item 1.

Business

Description of Business

Southwest Airlines Co. (“Southwest”) is a major domestic airline that
provides predominantly shorthaul, high-frequency, point-to-point, low-fare
service. Southwest was incorporated in Texas in 1967 and commenced Customer
Service on June 18, 1971 with three Boeing 737 aircraft serving three Texas
cities - Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio.

At year-end 2003, Southwest operated 388 Boeing 737 aircraft and provided
service to 59 airports in 58 cities in 30 states throughout the United States.
Southwest Airlines topped the monthly domestic passenger traffic rankings for
the first time in May 2003. Based on monthly data from May through August 2003
(the latest available data), Southwest Airlines is the largest carrier in the
United States based on originating domestic passengers boarded and scheduled
domestic departures. The Company recently announced that it intends to begin
service to Philadelphia in May 2004.

One of Southwest’s competitive strengths is its low operating costs.
Southwest has the lowest costs, adjusted for stage length, on a per mile basis,
of all of the major airlines. Among the factors that contribute to its low
cost structure are a single aircraft type, an efficient, high-utilization,
point-to-point route structure, and hardworking, innovative, and highly
productive Employees.

The business of the Company is somewhat seasonal. Quarterly operating
income and, to a lesser extent, revenues tend to be lower in the first quarter
(January 1 - March 31) and fourth quarter (October 1 - December 31) of most
years.

Southwest’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”),
including its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,
current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are accessible free
of charge at www.southwest.com.

Fuel

The cost of fuel is an item having significant impact on the Company’s
operating results. The Company’s average cost of jet fuel, net of hedging
gains, over the past five years was as follows:

Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of Southwest’s fuel
hedging activities.

Regulation

Economic

. The Dallas Love Field section of the International Air
Transportation Competition Act of 1979, as amended in 1997 (commonly known as
the “Wright Amendment”), as it affects Southwest’s scheduled service, provides
that no common carrier may provide scheduled passenger air transportation for
compensation between Love Field and one or more points outside Texas, except
that an air carrier may transport individuals by air on a flight between Love
Field and one or more points within the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas if (a) “such air
carrier does not offer or provide any through service or ticketing with another
air carrier” and (b) “such air carrier does not offer for sale transportation
to or from, and the flight or aircraft does not serve, any point which is
outside any such states.” The Wright Amendment does not restrict flights
operated with aircraft having 56 or fewer passenger seats. The Wright Amendment
does not restrict Southwest’s intrastate Texas flights or its air service from
points other than Love Field.

The Department of Transportation (“DOT”) has significant regulatory
jurisdiction over passenger airlines. Unless exempted, no air carrier may
furnish air transportation over any route without a DOT certificate of public
convenience and necessity, which does not confer either exclusive or
proprietary rights. The Company’s certificates are unlimited in duration and
permit the Company to operate among any points within the United States, its
territories and possessions, except as limited by the Wright Amendment, as do
the certificates of all other U.S. carriers. DOT may revoke such certificates,
in whole or in part, for intentional failure to comply with certain provisions
of the U.S. Transportation Code, or any order or regulation issued thereunder
or any term of such certificate; provided that, with respect to revocation, the
certificate holder has first been advised of the alleged violation and fails to
comply after being given a reasonable time to do so.

DOT prescribes uniform disclosure standards regarding terms and conditions
of carriage and prescribes that terms incorporated into the Contract of
Carriage by reference are not binding upon passengers unless notice is given in
accordance with its regulations.

Safety.

The Company and its third-party maintenance providers are subject
to the jurisdiction of the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) with respect
to its aircraft maintenance and operations, including equipment, ground
facilities, dispatch, communications, flight training personnel, and other
matters affecting air safety. To ensure compliance with its regulations, the
FAA requires airlines to obtain operating, airworthiness, and other
certificates, which are subject to suspension or revocation for cause. The
Company has obtained such certificates. The FAA, acting through its own powers
or through the appropriate U. S. Attorney, also has the power to bring
proceedings for the imposition and collection of fines for violation of the
Federal Air Regulations.

The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws and
regulations relating to occupational safety and health, including Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
regulations.

Security.

On November 19, 2001, President Bush signed into law the
Aviation and Transportation Security Act (“Security Act”). The Security Act
generally provides for enhanced aviation security measures. The Security Act
established a new Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), which has
recently been



moved to the new Department of Homeland Security. The TSA
assumed the aviation security functions previously residing in the FAA and
assumed passenger screening contracts at U.S. airports on February 17, 2002.
The TSA now provides for the screening of all passengers and property, which is
performed by federal employees. Beginning February 1, 2002, a $2.50 per
enplanement security fee is imposed on passengers (maximum of $5.00 per one-way trip). This fee was
suspended by Congress from June 1 through September 30, 2003. Pursuant to
authority granted to the TSA to impose additional fees on air carriers if
necessary to cover additional federal aviation security costs, the TSA has
imposed an annual Security Infrastructure Fee which approximated $23 million
for Southwest in 2002 and $18 million in 2003. This fee was also suspended by
Congress from June 1 through September 30, 2003. Like the FAA, the TSA may
impose and collect fines for violations of its regulations.

Enhanced security measures have had, and will continue to have, a
significant impact on the airport experience for passengers. While these
security requirements have not impacted aircraft utilization, they have
impacted our business. The Company has invested significantly in facilities,
equipment, and technology to process Customers efficiently and restore the
airport experience. The Company has implemented its Automated Boarding Passes
and RAPID CHECK-IN self service kiosks in its 59 airports to reduce the number
of lines in which a Customer must wait. During 2003, the Company also
installed gate readers at all of its airports to improve the boarding
reconciliation process. In 2004, Customers will be able to check baggage using
RAPID CHECK-IN kiosks. Southwest also plans to introduce internet checkin and
transfer boarding passes at the time of checkin.

Environmental.

Certain airports, including San Diego and Orange County,
have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on
aircraft types to be used, and limits on the number of hourly or daily
operations or the time of such operations. In some instances, these
restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating
costs and such restrictions could limit the ability of Southwest to expand its
operations at the affected airports. Local authorities at other airports may
consider adopting similar noise regulations, but such regulations are subject
to the provisions of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

Operations at John Wayne Airport, Orange County, California, are governed
by the Airport’s Phase 2 Commercial Airline Access Plan and Regulation (the
“Plan”). Pursuant to the Plan, each airline is allocated total annual seat
capacity to be operated at the airport, subject to renewal/reallocation on an
annual basis. Service at this airport may be adjusted annually to meet these
requirements.

The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws and
regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including the
discharge or disposal of materials such as chemicals, hazardous waste, and
aircraft deicing fluid. Regulatory developments pertaining to such things as
control of engine exhaust emissions from ground support equipment and
prevention of leaks from underground aircraft fueling systems could increase
operating costs in the airline industry. The Company does not believe,
however, that such environmental regulatory developments will have a material
impact on the Company’s capital expenditures or otherwise adversely effect its
operations, operating costs, or competitive position. Additionally, in
conjunction with airport authorities, other airlines, and state and local
environmental regulatory agencies, the Company is undertaking voluntary
investigation or remediation of soil or groundwater contamination at several
airport sites. The Company does not believe that any environmental liability
associated with such sites will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
operations, costs, or profitability.



Customer Service Commitment

. From time to time, the airline transportation
industry has been faced with possible legislation dealing with certain Customer
service practices. As a compromise with Congress, the industry, working with
the Air Transport Association, has responded by adopting and filing with the
DOT written plans disclosing how it would commit to improving performance.
Southwest Airlines formalized its dedication to Customer Satisfaction by
adopting its Customer Service Commitment, a comprehensive plan which embodies
the Mission Statement of Southwest Airlines: dedication to the highest quality
of Customer Service delivered with a sense of warmth, friendliness, individual
pride, and Company Spirit. The Customer Service Commitment can be reviewed by
clicking on “About SWA” at www.southwest.com. Congress is expected to monitor
the effects of the industry’s plans, and there can be no assurance that
legislation will not be proposed in the future to regulate airline Customer
service practices.

Marketing and Competition

Southwest focuses principally on point-to-point, rather than
hub-and-spoke, service in markets with frequent, conveniently timed flights and
low fares. At year-end, Southwest served 337 nonstop city pairs. Southwest’s
average aircraft trip stage length in 2003 was 558 miles with an average
duration of approximately 1.5 hours. Examples of markets offering frequent
daily flights are: Dallas to Houston, 35 weekday roundtrips; Phoenix to Las
Vegas, 19 weekday roundtrips; and Los Angeles International to Oakland, 22
weekday roundtrips. Southwest complements these high-frequency shorthaul
routes with longhaul nonstop service between markets such as Baltimore and Los
Angeles, Phoenix and Tampa Bay, Seattle and Nashville, and Houston and Oakland.

Southwest’s point-to-point route system, as compared to hub-and-spoke,
provides for more direct nonstop routings for Customers and, therefore,
minimizes connections, delays, and total trip time. Southwest focuses on
nonstop, not connecting, traffic. As a result, approximately 79 percent of the
Company’s Customers fly nonstop. In addition, Southwest serves many
conveniently located satellite or downtown airports such as Dallas Love Field,
Houston Hobby, Chicago Midway, Baltimore-Washington International, Burbank,
Manchester, Oakland, San Jose, Providence, Ft. Lauderdale/Hollywood and Long
Island Islip airports, which are typically less congested than other airlines’
hub airports and enhance the Company’s ability to sustain high Employee
productivity and reliable ontime performance. This operating strategy also
permits the Company to achieve high asset utilization. Aircraft are scheduled
to minimize the amount of time the aircraft are at the gate, currently
approximately 25 minutes, thereby reducing the number of aircraft and gate
facilities that would otherwise be required. The Company operates only one
aircraft type, the Boeing 737, which simplifies scheduling, maintenance, flight
operations, and training activities. Southwest does not interline or offer
joint fares with other airlines, nor have any commuter feeder relationships.

Southwest employs a relatively simple fare structure, featuring low,
unrestricted, unlimited, everyday coach fares, as well as even lower fares
available on a restricted basis. The Company’s highest oneway unrestricted
walkup fare offered is $299 for any flight. Even lower walkup fares are
available on Southwest’s short and medium haul flights.

Southwest was the first major airline to introduce a Ticketless travel
option, eliminating the need to print and then process a paper ticket
altogether, and the first to offer Ticketless travel through the Company’s home
page on the Internet, www.southwest.com. For the year ended December 31, 2003,
more than 85 percent of Southwest’s Customers chose the Ticketless travel
option and approximately 54 percent of Southwest’s passenger revenues came
through its Internet site, which has become a vital part of the Company’s
distribution strategy. As part of Southwest’s cost reduction measures and due
to the success of



its website, the Company has announced it will no longer pay
commissions to travel agents for sales on or after December 15, 2003.

The airline industry is highly competitive as to fares, frequent flyer
benefits, routes, and service, and some carriers competing with the Company
have larger fleets and wider name recognition. Certain major United States
airlines have established marketing or codesharing alliances with each other,
including Northwest Airlines/Continental Airlines/Delta Air Lines; American
Airlines/Alaska Airlines; and United Airlines/USAirways.

After the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001, and in the face of weak
demand for air service, most major carriers (not including Southwest)
significantly reduced service, grounded aircraft, and furloughed employees.
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, and US Airways sought relief from financial
obligations in bankruptcy and other, smaller carriers have ceased operation
entirely. America West Airlines, USAirways, and others received federal loan
guarantees authorized by federal law and additional airlines may do so in the
future. Many carriers renegotiated collective bargaining agreements and vendor
agreements, resulting in a reduction in their costs. More recently, many major
carriers have announced plans for capacity increases in 2004; likewise, smaller
low cost carriers have accelerated their growth
plans. While Southwest’s share of the domestic market has continued to
increase, it is not currently possible to assess the ultimate impact of all of
these events on airline competition.

The Company is also subject to varying degrees of competition from surface
transportation in its shorthaul markets, particularly the private automobile.
In shorthaul air services that compete with surface transportation, price is a
competitive factor, but frequency and convenience of scheduling, facilities,
transportation safety and security procedures, and Customer Service are also of
great importance to many passengers.

Insurance

The Company carries insurance of types customary in the airline industry
and at amounts deemed adequate to protect the Company and its property and to
comply both with federal regulations and certain of the Company’s credit and
lease agreements. The policies principally provide coverage for public and
passenger liability, property damage, cargo and baggage liability, loss or
damage to aircraft, engines, and spare parts, and workers’ compensation.

Following the terrorist attacks, commercial aviation insurers
significantly increased the premiums and reduced the amount of war-risk
coverage available to commercial carriers. The federal government stepped in
to provide supplemental third-party war-risk insurance coverage to commercial
carriers for renewable 60-day periods, at substantially lower premiums than
prevailing commercial rates and for levels of coverage not available in the
commercial market. In November 2002, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act
of 2002, which mandated the federal government to provide third party,
passenger and hull war-risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers through
August 31, 2003, and which permitted such coverage to be extended by the
government through December 31, 2003. The Emergency Wartime Supplemental
Appropriations Act (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
extends the government’s mandate to provide war-risk insurance until August 31,
2004, and permits such coverage to be extended until December 31, 2004. The
Company is unable to predict whether the government will extend this insurance
coverage past August 31, 2004, whether alternative commercial insurance with
comparable coverage will become available at reasonable premiums, and what
impact this will have on the Company’s ongoing operations or future financial
performance.



Frequent Flyer Awards

Southwest’s frequent flyer program, Rapid Rewards, is based on trips flown
rather than mileage. Rapid Rewards Customers earn a flight segment credit for
each one-way trip flown or two credits for each round trip flown. Rapid
Rewards Customers can also receive flight segment credits by using the services
of non-airline partners, which include car rental agencies, hotels, and credit
card partners, including the Southwest Airlines Bank One (formerly First USA

(R)

) Visa card. Rapid Rewards offers two types of travel awards. The Rapid
Rewards Award Ticket (“Award Ticket”) offers one free roundtrip travel award to
any Southwest destination after the accumulation of 16 flight segment credits
within a consecutive twelve-month period. The Rapid Rewards Companion Pass
(“Companion Pass”) is granted for flying 50 roundtrips (or 100 one-way trips)
on Southwest within a consecutive twelve-month period. The Companion Pass
offers unlimited free roundtrip travel to any Southwest destination for a
designated companion of the qualifying Rapid Rewards member. In order for the
designated companion to use this pass, the Rapid Rewards member must purchase a
ticket or use an Award Ticket. Additionally, the Rapid Rewards member and
designated companion must travel together on the same flight.

Trips flown are valid for flight segment credits toward Award Tickets and
Companion Passes for twelve months only; Award Tickets and Companion Passes are
automatically generated when earned by the Customer rather than allowing the
Customer to bank credits indefinitely; and Award Tickets and Companion Passes
are valid for one year with an automatic expiration date. “Black out” dates
apply during peak holiday periods. Unlike most of its competitors, the Company
does not limit the number of seats available to holders of Award Tickets and
Companion Passes.

The Company also sells flight segment credits to business partners
including credit card companies, phone companies, hotels, and car rental
agencies. These credits may be redeemed for Award Tickets having the same
program characteristics as those earned by flying.

Customers redeemed approximately 2.5 million, 2.2 million, and 1.7 million
Award Tickets and flights on Companion Passes during 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively. The amount of free travel award usage as a percentage of total
Southwest revenue passengers carried was 7.5 percent in 2003, 6.8 percent in
2002, and 5.4 percent in 2001. The number of Award Tickets outstanding at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately 1.4 million. In addition, there
were approximately 5.6 million partially earned Award Tickets as of December
31, 2003. However, due to the expected expiration of a portion of credits
making up these partial awards, not all of them will eventually turn into
useable Award Tickets. Also, not all Award Tickets will be redeemed for future
travel. Since the inception of Rapid Rewards in 1987, approximately 14 percent
of all Award Tickets have expired without being used. The number of Companion
Passes for Southwest outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was
approximately 53,000 and 55,000, respectively. The Company currently estimates
that an average of 3 to 4 trips will be redeemed per outstanding Companion
Pass.

The Company accounts for its frequent flyer program obligations by
recording a liability for the estimated incremental cost of flight awards the
Company expects to be redeemed (except for flight segment credits sold to
business partners). This method recognizes an average incremental cost to
provide roundtrip transportation to one additional passenger. The estimated
incremental cost includes direct passenger costs such as fuel, food, and other
operational costs, but does not include any contribution to overhead or profit.
The incremental cost is accrued at the time an award is earned and revenue is
subsequently recognized, at the amount accrued, when the free travel award is
used. Revenue from the sale of flight segment credits and associated with
future travel is deferred and recognized when the ultimate free travel award is
flown or the



credits expire unused. Accordingly, Southwest does not accrue
incremental cost for the expected redemption of free travel awards for credits
sold to business partners. The liability for free travel awards earned but not
used at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was not material.

Employees

At December 31, 2003, Southwest had 32,847 active Employees, consisting of
10,854 flight, 1,956 maintenance, 15,949 ground Customer and fleet service and
4,088 management, accounting, marketing, and clerical personnel.

Southwest has ten collective bargaining agreements covering approximately
80.2 percent of its Employees. The following table sets forth the Company’s

Ground Facilities and Services

Southwest leases terminal passenger service facilities at each of the
airports it serves, to which it has added various leasehold improvements. The
Company leases land on a long-term basis for its maintenance
centers located at Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Phoenix Sky Harbor, and
Chicago Midway, its training center near Love Field, which houses six 737
simulators, and its corporate headquarters, also located near



Love Field. The
maintenance, training center, and corporate headquarters buildings on these
sites were built and are owned by Southwest. At December 31, 2003, the Company
operated nine reservation centers. The reservation centers located in Little
Rock, Arkansas; Chicago, Illinois; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma; and Salt Lake City, Utah occupy leased space. The Company owns its
Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; and San Antonio, Texas
reservation centers. The Company recently announced that it intends to close
its Dallas, Salt Lake City, and Little Rock reservations centers on February
28, 2004.

Southwest has entered into a concession agreement with the Town of Islip,
New York which gives the Company the right to construct, furnish, occupy, and
maintain a new concourse at the airport. Once all phases of the project are
completed, the concourse could have up to a total of eight gates. Phase I of
this project, which is expected to be ready for operations in mid-2004,
includes four gates. Phase II construction, which includes an additional 4
gates, could, at the Company’s election, begin immediately upon the completion
of Phase I and could be completed in 2005. When all phases of construction are
complete, the entire new concourse will become the property of the Town of
Islip. In return for constructing the new concourse, Southwest will receive
fixed-rent abatements for a total of 25 years; however, the Company will still
be required to pay variable rents for common use areas and manage the new
concourse.

The Company performs substantially all line maintenance on its aircraft
and provides ground support services at most of the airports it serves.
However, the Company has arrangements with certain aircraft maintenance firms
for major component inspections and repairs for its airframes and engines,
which comprise the majority of the annual aircraft maintenance costs.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in
the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, examinations by
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS regularly examines the Company’s
federal income tax returns and, in the course of those examinations, proposes
adjustments to the Company’s federal income tax liability reported on such
returns. It is the Company’s practice to vigorously contest those proposed
adjustments that it deems lacking of merit. The Company’s management does not
expect that the outcome in any of its currently ongoing legal proceedings or
the outcome of any proposed adjustments presented to date by the IRS,
individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The issuances of the above options and shares to Mr. Kelleher were deemed
exempt from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”), by reason of the provision of Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act because, among other things, of the limited number of
participants in such transactions and the agreement and representation of Mr.
Kelleher that he was acquiring such securities for investment and not with a
view to distribution thereof. The certificates representing the



shares issued
to Mr. Kelleher contain a legend to the effect that such shares are not
registered under the Securities Act and may not be transferred except pursuant
to a registration statement which has become effective under the Securities Act
or to an exemption from such registration. The issuance of such shares was not
underwritten.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEAR IN REVIEW

In 2003, Southwest posted a profit for the 31st consecutive year. The Company
also extended its streak of consecutive quarterly profits to 51 periods in
fourth quarter 2003. Both of these achievements are unsurpassed in the airline
industry. For the third consecutive year, the airline industry as a whole
suffered a net loss and many of the larger airlines underwent or continued
massive efforts to restructure their business, gain wage concessions from their
employees, and slash costs in efforts to avoid bankruptcy or emerge from
bankruptcy. For the Company, although profitability levels have not returned
to those achieved prior to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, profits
increased considerably versus 2002, even excluding the impact of government
grants received in both years.

Although the process has been gradual, revenue trends had shown improvement
prior to the Iraq war, and have steadily improved since major hostilities in
Iraq ended in May 2003. However, air traffic remains depressed compared to
pre-September 11, 2001, levels, particularly business demand. Unit revenues
continue to run below pre-September 11, 2001, levels by more than 10 percent
and the percentage of Customers traveling on full-fares remains down from
historical levels. The Company does not anticipate a complete recovery in
revenues until the economy fully recovers and there is an upturn in business
travel.

The Company’s business strategy did not waver in 2003. Southwest remained
committed to providing predominantly shorthaul flights, high frequency service,
low fares, point-to-point flying, and high-quality Customer Service, all while
keeping costs low. The Company also continued to complement this strategy by
adding longer haul flights, including transcontinental service.

The Company continued to respond to the many security changes imposed since the
terrorist attacks and find ways to improve Customer convenience and the airport
experience. The Company has automated and significantly streamlined the
ticketing and boarding process with computer generated bag tags, automated
boarding passes, self-service boarding pass kiosks, and electronic boarding
pass readers at the gate. The Company also has made technological
advancements, including the addition of functionality to its website at
www.southwest.com, and has continued to enhance its fleet interiors with a new
look, including comfortable leather seats.

The Company did not open any new cities in 2003, although it continued to
improve its quality of service between cities already served. The Company
recently announced that it would begin new service to Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania in May 2004, which will represent the Company’s 60th airport and
31st state to which it flies. During 2003, the Company added 17 new 737-700
aircraft to its fleet and retired four older 737-200 aircraft, resulting in a
net capacity increase of 4.2 percent. This brought the Company’s all-737 fleet
to 388 aircraft at the end of 2003.

During 2003, the Company made announcements that are expected to benefit the
Company’s overall cost structure in 2004 and beyond. The Company announced it
would add “blended winglets” to its fleet of 737-700 aircraft. The addition of
these wing enhancements, which began to be retrofitted on existing aircraft in
fourth quarter 2003 and are expected to take place through early 2005, will
extend the range of these aircraft, save fuel, lower engine maintenance costs,
and reduce takeoff noise. New aircraft are expected to arrive with winglets
already installed beginning in August 2004. In October 2003, the Company
announced it would no longer pay commissions on travel agency sales effective
December 15, 2003, consistent with virtually all other U.S. airlines. This
change in policy is expected



to save the Company approximately $40 million in
2004. In November 2003, the Company also announced the consolidation of its
nine Reservations Centers into six, effective February 28, 2004. This decision
was made in response to the established shift to the internet as a preferred
way of booking travel. The Company’s website, www.southwest.com, is now
accountable for more than half of passenger revenues, and, as a consequence,
demand for phone contact has dramatically decreased. The Company estimates the
costs associated with this decision, approximately $20 million, will be
recognized primarily in first quarter 2004. These costs are primarily related
to Employee relocation expenses and severance packages. The Company estimates
that future annual operating cost savings related to this decision will exceed
the costs incurred. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information. The Company also expects to benefit from efficiencies
achieved at airports through our effort to improve the Customer experience in
ticketing and boarding.

Available seat mile (ASM) capacity currently is expected to grow in the 7 to 8
percent range in 2004 with the planned net addition of 29 aircraft. The
Company currently has 47 new Boeing 737–700s scheduled for delivery during the
year and plans to retire 18 of the Company’s older 737-200s.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

The Company’s consolidated net income for 2003 was
$442 million ($.54 per share, diluted), as compared to 2002 net income of $241
million ($.30 per share, diluted), an increase of $201 million or 83.4 percent.
Operating income for 2003 was $483 million, an increase of $66 million, or
15.8 percent compared to 2002.

As disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, results for
2003 included $271 million as “Other gains” from the Emergency Wartime
Supplemental Appropriations Act (Wartime Act) and results for 2002 included $48
million as “Other gains” from grants under the Air Transportation Safety and
System Stabilization Act (Stabilization Act). The Company believes that
excluding the impact of these special items will enhance comparative analysis
of results. The grants were made to stabilize and support the airline industry
as a result of the devastating effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks and the 2003 war with Iraq. Neither of these grants was indicative of
the Company’s operating performance for these respective periods, nor should
they be considered in developing trend analysis for future periods. The
following table reconciles results reported in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for 2003 and 2002 with results excluding
the impact of the government grants received:



Excluding the governments grants received in both years, consolidated net
income for 2003 was $298 million ($.36 per share, diluted), as compared to 2002
net income of $216 million ($.27 per share,
diluted), an increase of $82 million, or 38.0 percent. The increase was
primarily due to overall higher demand for air travel in 2003, vacation travel
in particular. Operating income for 2003 was $523 million, an increase of $99
million, or 23.3 percent compared to 2002.

OPERATING REVENUES Consolidated operating revenues increased $415 million, or
7.5 percent, primarily due to a $400 million, or 7.5 percent, increase in
passenger revenues. The increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to a
5.6 percent increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) flown. Although the
Company saw a disruption in revenue and bookings due to the threat of war and
from the subsequent conflict between the United States and Iraq during the
first half of 2003, demand improved following the war.

The increase in revenue passenger miles primarily was due to a 4.2 percent
increase in added capacity, as measured by available seat miles or ASMs. This
was achieved through the Company’s net addition of 13 aircraft during 2003 (net
of four aircraft retirements). The Company’s improved load factor for 2003
(RPMs divided by ASMs) was 66.8 percent, compared to 65.9 percent for 2002.
The improved 2003 load factor is still well below pre-September 11, 2001,
annual levels. Passenger yields for 2003 (passenger revenue divided by RPMs)
were $.1197 compared to $.1177 in 2002, an increase of 1.7 percent, due to less
heavy fare discounting in 2003 by the Company and the airline industry in
general.

As the economy recovers and demand for business travel increases, the Company’s
operating revenue yields per ASM (unit revenues) gradually continue to improve.
Although the first half of January 2004 showed modest unit revenue growth,
bookings suggest that January’s load factor could fall below January 2003’s
load factor of 58.0 percent.

Consolidated freight revenues increased $9 million, or 10.6 percent, primarily
due to an increase in freight and cargo units shipped. Other revenues
increased $6 million, or 6.3 percent, primarily due to an increase



in
commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business
partners, such as the Company-sponsored Bank One® (formerly First USA) Visa
card.

OPERATING EXPENSES Consolidated operating expenses for 2003 increased $349
million, or 6.8 percent, compared to the 4.2 percent increase in capacity. To
a large extent, changes in operating expenses for airlines are driven by
changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents Southwest’s operating
expenses per ASM for 2003 and 2002 followed by explanations of these changes on
a per-ASM basis:

Operating expenses per ASM increased 2.6 percent to $.0760, primarily due to
increases in salaries, profitsharing, and jet fuel prices, after hedging gains.
For first quarter 2004, excluding costs associated with the Company’s
reservations center consolidation, the Company currently expects an increase in
operating expenses per ASM compared to first quarter 2003 primarily due to
higher salaries, jet fuel prices, and airport costs. Based on the Company’s
aggressive efforts to mitigate these cost pressures, unit costs should begin to
decline in the second half of 2004. For the year 2004, the Company’s goal is
to, at least, keep unit costs flat with 2003.

Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased 7.3 percent.
Approximately 60 percent of the increase was due to an increase in salaries and
wages per ASM, primarily from increases in average wage rates. The majority of
the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in Employee retirement
plans expense per ASM, primarily from the increase in 2003 earnings and
resulting profitsharing. The Company also expects to experience an increase in
salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM in 2004 due, in part, to restructuring
charges related to the consolidation of the Company’s reservations centers.
See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company’s Flight Attendants are subject to an agreement with the TWU that
became amendable in June 2002. In September 2003, the Company and the TWU
requested the assistance of the National Mediation Board in the negotiations
for a new contract; however, as of the end of 2003, a mutual agreement had not
been reached.

Fuel and oil expense per ASM increased 4.5 percent, primarily due to a 6.3
percent increase in the average jet fuel cost per gallon. The average cost per
gallon of jet fuel in 2003 was 72.3 cents compared to 68.0 cents in 2002,
excluding fuel related taxes but including the effects of hedging activities.
The Company’s 2003 and 2002 average jet fuel costs are net of approximately
$171 million and $45 million in gains from hedging activities, respectively.
See Note 2 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As detailed
in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the



Company has hedges in
place for over 80 percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in 2004 with a
combination of derivative instruments that effectively cap prices at about $24
per barrel, including approximately 82 percent of its anticipated requirements
for first quarter 2004. Considering current market prices and the continued
effectiveness of the Company’s fuel hedges, the Company is forecasting first
quarter 2004 average fuel cost per gallon to be in the 75 to 80 cent range.
The majority of the Company’s near term hedge positions are in the form of
option contracts, which protect the Company in the event of rising jet fuel
prices and allow the Company to benefit in the event of declining prices.

Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM increased 5.3 percent primarily due
to an increase in engine maintenance. The Company outsources all of its engine
maintenance work. Approximately half of the increase in engine maintenance
expense was for 737-300 and -500 aircraft subject to a long-term maintenance
contract, which is based on a contract rate charged per hour flown. The
majority of the increase in engine expense for these aircraft in 2003 was due
to an increase in the contract rate per hour flown, predicated on increased
engine maintenance events. The other half of the increase in engine
maintenance expense was for 737-700 aircraft, which is based on a time and
materials basis. Expense for these aircraft engines increased because of an
increase in repairs for these aircraft engines. Currently, the Company expects
an increase in maintenance materials and repairs expense per ASM in first
quarter 2004, versus 2003, due to the number of engine repairs scheduled.

Agency commissions per ASM decreased 12.5 percent, primarily due to a decline
in commissionable revenues. The percentage of commissionable revenues
decreased from approximately 20 percent in 2002 to approximately 16 percent in
2003. Approximately 54 percent of passenger revenues in 2003 were derived
through the Company’s web site at www.southwest.com versus 49 percent in 2002.
In October 2003, the Company announced it would no longer pay commissions on
travel agency sales effective December 15, 2003. This change in policy is
expected to save the Company approximately $40 million in 2004.

Aircraft rentals per ASM and depreciation expense per ASM were both impacted by
a higher percentage of the aircraft fleet being owned. Aircraft rentals per
ASM decreased 7.4 percent while depreciation expense per ASM increased 1.9
percent. The Company owns all 17 of the aircraft it put into service during
2003. This, along with the retirement of three owned and one leased aircraft,
has increased the Company’s percentage of aircraft owned or on capital lease to
77 percent at December 31, 2003, from 76 percent at December 31, 2002. Based
on the Company’s scheduled 2004 capacity increases and aircraft financing
plans, the Company expects a decline in aircraft rental expense per ASM in
2004.

Landing fees and other rentals per ASM increased 4.0 percent primarily as a
result of higher space rental rates throughout the Company’s system. During
2003, many other major airlines reduced their flight capacity at airports
served by the Company. Since Southwest did not reduce its flights, the Company
incurred higher airport costs based on a greater relative share of total
flights and passengers.

Other operating expenses per ASM decreased 6.8 percent. Approximately 70
percent of the decrease was due to lower aviation insurance costs. Following
the September 2001 terrorist attacks, commercial aviation insurers
significantly increased the premiums and reduced the amount of war-risk
coverage available to commercial carriers. The federal government stepped in to
provide supplemental third-party war-risk insurance coverage to commercial
carriers for renewable 60-days periods, at substantially lower premiums than
then-prevailing commercial rates and for levels of coverage not available in
the commercial market. In November 2002, Congress passed the Homeland Security
Act of 2002, which mandated the federal government provide third party,
passenger, and hull war-risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers through
August 31, 2003, and which permitted such coverage to be extended by the
government through December 31, 2003. The Emergency Wartime



Supplemental
Appropriations Act (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
extended the government’s mandate to provide war-risk insurance until August
31, 2004, and permits extensions until December 31, 2004. As a result of more
coverage from government insurance programs and a more stable aviation
insurance market, the Company was able to negotiate lower 2003 aviation
insurance premiums than 2002. However, aviation insurance remains
substantially higher than before September 11, 2001. The majority of the
remaining decrease in other operating expenses per ASM was due to reductions in
security costs from the transition of airport security to the federal
government, and decreases in advertising and personnel-related expenses. As a
result of recently concluded negotiations
for 2004 commercial insurance coverage and the additional coverage provided by
the government, the Company currently expects other operating expenses per ASM
to decrease again, in 2004.

OTHER “Other expenses (income)” included interest expense, capitalized
interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense
decreased $15 million, or 14.2 percent, compared to the prior year, primarily
due to lower effective interest rates. The Company executed two interest-rate
swaps in second quarter 2003 to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt to a
lower floating rate. The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements
relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2012 and
$375 million 5.496% Class A-2 pass-through certificates due November 1, 2006.
See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on
the Company’s hedging activities. Excluding the effect of any new debt
offerings the Company may execute during 2004, the Company expects a decrease
in interest expense compared to 2003, due to the full year effect of the 2003
interest rate swaps, the October 2003 redemption of its $100 million senior
unsecured 8 3/4% Notes, and the scheduled redemption of the Company’s $175
million Aircraft Secured Notes on its due date in fourth quarter 2004.
Capitalized interest increased $16 million, or 94.1 percent, primarily as a

result of higher 2003 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft
deliveries, compared to 2002. Based on the Company’s current schedule of
progress payments and aircraft deliveries, the Company expects progress payment
balances, and corresponding capitalized interest, to increase in 2004 compared
to 2003. Interest income decreased $13 million, or 35.1 percent, primarily due
to a decrease in rates earned on short-term investments. Other gains in 2003
and 2002 primarily resulted from government grants of $271 million and $48
million, respectively, received pursuant to the Wartime and the Stabilization
Acts. See Note 3 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion of these Acts.

INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before
taxes, decreased to 37.60 percent in 2003 from 38.64 percent in 2002 due to
higher Company earnings in 2003 and lower effective state income tax rates.

2002 COMPARED WITH 2001

The Company’s consolidated net income for 2002 was
$241 million ($.30 per share, diluted), as compared to 2001 net income of $511
million ($.63 per share, diluted), a decrease of $270 million or 52.8 percent.
Approximately 43 percent of this decrease was due to the decrease in government
grants that the Company recognized under the Stabilization Act. In 2002 and
2001, the Company recognized $48 million (pretax) and $235 million (pretax) in
government grants under the Stabilization Act. See Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The remainder of the decrease primarily was due to the
full-year impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the Company and
the airline industry.

Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, all U.S. commercial flight
operations were suspended for approximately three days. However, the Company
continued to incur nearly all of its normal operating expenses (with the
exception of certain direct trip-related expenditures such as fuel, landing
fees, etc.). The Company canceled approximately 9,000 flights before resuming
flight operations on September 14. After operations were fully resumed, load
factors and passenger yields were severely depressed, and ticket refund
activity increased. In addition, operating expenses in areas



such as aviation
insurance and security-related expenses were much higher than before. From
January 2001 through the end of August 2001, the Company had earned
approximately $707 million in operating income. However, for September 2001,
it incurred operating losses of $113 million, and for fourth quarter 2001,
operating income was $37 million. For the full year 2002, operating income was
$417 million, a decrease of $214 million, or 33.9 percent compared to 2001 due
to the full year impact the terrorist attacks had on airline industry revenue
performance.

OPERATING REVENUES Consolidated 2002 operating revenues decreased $33 million
from 2001, or .6 percent, primarily due to a $38 million, or .7 percent,
decrease in passenger revenues. The decrease in passenger revenues was
primarily due to lower load factors attributable to the post-September 11, 2001
reduction in demand for air travel. The Company’s load factor for 2002 was
65.9 percent, compared to 68.1 percent for 2001, resulting from a capacity
(ASM) increase of 5.5 percent versus a traffic (RPM) increase of only 2.0
percent. The increase in ASMs was due to the net addition of 20 aircraft
during 2002 (net of three aircraft retirements).

Consolidated freight revenues decreased $6 million, or 6.6 percent, primarily
due to a 40.3 percent decrease in mail revenues. Following the terrorist
attacks, the United States Postal Service shifted a significant portion of the
mail that commercial carriers had previously carried to freight carriers. The
mail decrease more than offset an 11.4 percent increase in other freight
revenues. Other revenues increased $11 million, or 12.9 percent, primarily due
to an increase in commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with
certain business partners, such as the Company-sponsored Bank One® Visa card.

OPERATING EXPENSES Consolidated operating expenses for 2002 increased $181
million, or 3.7 percent, compared to the 5.5 percent increase in capacity. To a
large extent, changes in operating expenses for airlines are driven by changes
in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents Southwest’s operating expenses
per ASM for 2002 and 2001 followed by explanations of these changes on a per
ASM basis:

Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased 1.8 percent due to a
5.7 percent increase in salaries and wages per ASM and a 7.6 percent increase
in benefits expense per ASM, mostly offset by a 30.3 percent decrease in
Employee retirement plans expense per ASM. The majority of the increase in
salaries and wages was due to headcount additions outpacing the Company’s
capacity growth in several operational areas, due in part to additional
security requirements at airports. The remaining portion of the increase in
salaries and wages per ASM primarily was due to higher average wage rates.



The increase in benefits expense per ASM primarily was due to higher health
care costs. Employee retirement plans expense per ASM decreased due to lower
Company earnings available for profitsharing. In 2002 and 2001, earnings
available for profitsharing included $48 million and $235 million,
respectively, from grants recognized under the Stabilization Act. See Note 3
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fuel and oil expense per ASM decreased 5.9 percent, primarily due to a 4.0
percent decrease in the average jet fuel cost per gallon. The average cost per
gallon of jet fuel in 2002 was 68.0 cents compared to 70.9 cents in 2001,
excluding fuel related taxes but including the effects of hedging activities.
The Company’s 2002 and 2001 average jet fuel costs are net of approximately $45
million and $80 million in gains from hedging activities, respectively. See
Notes 2 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM decreased 6.6 percent. This decrease
primarily was due to a decrease in airframe expense resulting from fewer
outsourced heavy maintenance events versus 2001. More heavy maintenance events
were performed internally in 2002, resulting in the labor costs associated with
those events being reflected in salaries and wages.

Agency commissions per ASM decreased 50.0 percent, primarily due to a change in
the Company’s commission rate policy. Effective October 15, 2001, the Company
reduced the commission paid to travel agents from eight percent for Ticketless
bookings and five percent for paper ticket bookings, to five percent,
regardless of the type of ticket sold. In addition, the mix of tickets sold
through travel agents declined from 25 percent of total revenues in 2001 to 20
percent in 2002, thereby reducing commissionable revenues and commission
expense.

Aircraft rentals per ASM and depreciation expense per ASM were both impacted by
a higher percentage of the aircraft fleet being owned. Aircraft rentals per
ASM decreased 6.9 percent while depreciation expense per ASM increased 6.1
percent. The Company owns all 23 of the aircraft it put into service during
2002. This, along with the retirement of one owned and two leased aircraft in
2002, increased the Company’s percentage of aircraft owned or on capital lease
to 76 percent at December 31, 2002, from 74 percent at December 31, 2001.

Landing fees and other rentals per ASM increased 4.2 percent primarily as a
result of airport rate increases throughout the Company’s system. Moreover,
following the terrorist attacks, most other major airlines reduced their flight
schedules due to the drop in air travel. Since Southwest did not reduce its
flights, the Company incurred higher airport costs based on a greater relative
share of total flights and passengers.

Other operating expenses per ASM decreased 1.3 percent despite a per-ASM
increase of more than 175 percent in aviation insurance costs. The insurance
cost increases were more than offset through various cost control measures
implemented immediately following the prior year terrorist attacks, including
reductions in personnel related expenses and office expenses. Excluding
insurance expense, other operating expenses per ASM decreased 8.5 percent.
Following the terrorist attacks, commercial aviation insurers significantly
increased the premiums and reduced the amount of war-risk coverage available to
commercial carriers. The federal government then stepped in to provide
supplemental third-party war-risk insurance coverage to commercial airlines,
for renewable 60-days periods, at substantially lower premiums than prevailing
commercial rates during 2002 and for levels of coverage not available at that
time in the commercial market.

OTHER “Other expenses (income)” included interest expense, capitalized
interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense
increased $36 million, or 51.4 percent, compared to the prior year, due to
higher debt levels. In fourth quarter 2001, the Company issued $614 million



in
long-term debt in the form of Pass Through Certificates. In first quarter
2002, the Company issued $385 million in unsecured notes. See Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these two borrowings.
The increase in expense caused by these borrowings was partially offset by a
decrease in interest rates on the Company’s floating rate debt and the July
2001 redemption of $100 million of unsecured notes. Capitalized interest
decreased $4 million, or 19.0 percent, primarily as a result of lower 2002
progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft
deliveries, compared to 2001. Interest income decreased $6 million, or 14.0
percent, as higher invested cash balances for the year were more than offset by
lower rates. Other gains in 2002 and 2001 primarily resulted from $48 million
and $235 million, respectively, received as the Company’s share of government
grants under the Stabilization Act. See Note 3 to the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of the Stabilization Act.

INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before
taxes, increased to 38.64 percent in 2002 from 38.24 percent in 2001, primarily
due to the Company’s lower earnings in 2002.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in 2003 compared to
$520 million in 2002. For the Company, operating cash inflows are primarily
derived from providing air transportation for Customers. The vast majority of
tickets are purchased prior to the day in which travel is provided and, in some
cases, several months before the anticipated travel date. Operating cash
outflows are primarily related to the recurring expenses of operating the
airline. For 2003, the increase in operating cash flows primarily was due to
higher net income, largely attributable to the $271 million government grant
from the Wartime Act. Also contributing to the increase in operating cash
flows was an increase in accrued liabilities and a decrease in accounts and
other receivables. The increase in accrued liabilities primarily was due to an
increase in accrued profitsharing from higher 2003 earnings available for
profitsharing. The decrease in accounts and other receivables was primarily
due to the 2003 collection of a $51 million tax refund related to the 2002 tax
year. Cash generated in 2003 and in 2002 was primarily used to finance
aircraft-related capital expenditures and provide working capital.

Cash flows used in investing activities in 2003 totaled $1.2 billion compared
to $603 million in 2002. Investing activities in both years primarily
consisted of payments for new 737-700 aircraft delivered to the Company and
progress payments for future aircraft deliveries. Although the Company
received fewer new aircraft in 2003 (17 new 737-700s) versus 2002 (23 new
737-700s), there was a substantial increase in progress payments for future
deliveries compared to the prior year. The increase in progress payments
primarily was related to aircraft to be delivered in 2004 and 2005. During
2003, the Company accelerated the delivery for several aircraft from future
years into 2004, and exercised options for several 2004 and 2005 deliveries.
These decisions resulted in an acceleration of progress payments to the
manufacturer related to the aircraft. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Net cash used in financing activities was $48 million in 2003 compared to $382
million in 2002. Cash used in financing activities during 2003 was primarily
for the redemption of its $100 million senior unsecured 8 ¾% Notes
originally issued in 1991. This was mostly offset by proceeds of $93 million
from the exercise of Employee stock options. Cash used in financing activities
in 2002 was primarily for the repayment of the Company’s $475 million revolving
credit facility that the Company drew down in September 2001 and for the
repayment of a special purpose trust (Trust) created in 2001. See Note 4 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Trust. These
uses were partially offset by cash generated from the issuance of $385 million
in unsecured notes in March 2002. See Note 6 and Note 7 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information on these financing activities.



The Company has various options available to meet its capital and operating
commitments, including cash on hand at December 31, 2003, of $1.9 billion,
internally generated funds, and a $575 million bank revolving line of credit.
In addition, the Company will also consider various borrowing or leasing
options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements. The Company
believes it has access to a wide variety of financing arrangements because of
its excellent credit ratings, unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and
consistent profitability.

The Company has two fully available unsecured revolving credit facilities from
which it can borrow up to $575 million from a group of banks. One of the
facilities, for half of the total amount, was renewed for an additional year
during April 2003. This facility now expires in April 2004. The other
facility, for half of the amount, expires in April 2005. The Company expects
that it will be able to renew the expiring 364-day facility for an additional
364-day period at reasonable terms. If the Company is unable to renew, the
Company’s available credit facility will be reduced.

The Company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of
up to $1.0 billion in public debt securities and pass through certificates,
which it may utilize for aircraft financings in the future. The Company
currently expects that a portion of these securities will be issued in 2004.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AND CONTINGENT
LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

Southwest has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regards to
future purchases of aircraft, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. Along
with the receipt of 17 new 737-700 aircraft from Boeing in 2003, the Company
exercised several options for delivery in 2004 and 2005 and accelerated the
delivery dates for several aircraft into 2004 from future years. The Company
also entered into an agreement to lease a new Boeing 737-700 from a third party
beginning in 2004. The following table details the Company’s current firm
orders, options, and purchase rights for 737-700 aircraft:

The Company has engaged in off-balance sheet arrangements in the leasing of
aircraft. The leasing of aircraft provides flexibility to the Company by
allowing for capacity and fleet growth, without the substantial cash outlay
necessary to purchase new aircraft. Although the Company is responsible for
all maintenance, insurance, and expense associated with operating the aircraft,
and retains the risk of loss for leased aircraft, it has not made any
guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value (or market value) of the
aircraft at the end of the lease terms.

As shown above and as disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company operates 96 aircraft that it has leased from third
parties, of which 89 are operating leases. As prescribed by GAAP, assets and
obligations under operating lease are not included in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Disclosure of the contractual obligations
associated with the Company’s leased aircraft are shown below as well as in
Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company currently expects that it will issue a portion of its $1.0 billion
in public debt securities and pass through certificates from its outstanding
shelf registrations during 2004, in order to fulfill some of its obligations as
noted above.

There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at
December 31, 2003. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for
more information.

In January 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
up to $300 million of the Company’s common stock, utilizing present and
anticipated proceeds from the exercise of Employee



stock options. Repurchases
will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market
or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with United States GAAP. The Company’s significant accounting
policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the
Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes.
The Company’s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and
changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from
estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting
policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important
to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results and require
management’s most subjective judgments. The Company’s most critical accounting
policies and estimates are described below.

Revenue Recognition

As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, tickets sold
for passenger air travel are initially deferred as “Air traffic liability.”
Passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the
service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place). “Air traffic
liability” represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future
refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The Company’s air
traffic liability balance at December 31, 2003 was $462 million.

Estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded, exchanged, or forfeited
involves some level of subjectivity and judgment. The majority of the
Company’s tickets sold are nonrefundable, which is the primary source of
forfeited tickets. According to the Company’s “Contract of Carriage”, tickets
that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another
flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or can be refunded (if the ticket
is refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or partial tickets) expire
unused. Fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited. “Air traffic
liability” includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges,
net of forfeitures for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed.
These estimates are based on historical experience over many years. The
Company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this
accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel
is provided. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air
traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund
and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the Company’s estimates with
respect to forfeited tickets.

Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical
Customer travel patterns, as noted above, can result in actual refunds,
exchanges, or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates. The
Company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts.
If actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeiture experience results in an amount
outside of this range, estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments
to “Air traffic liability” and to “Passenger revenue” are recorded as
necessary. Additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges
include, but may not be limited to, the Company’s refund and exchange policy,
the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares, and promotional fare activity.
The Company’s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to
year; however, as with any estimates, actual refund and exchange activity may
vary from estimated amounts. Furthermore, the Company believes it is unlikely
that materially different estimates for future refunds, exchanges, and
forfeited tickets would be reported



based on other reasonable assumptions or
conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available
at the time estimates were made.

Following September 2001 and through 2002, the Company experienced fluctuations
in estimated refunds and exchanges, and correspondingly, forfeited tickets, due
to many of the factors described above. Following the terrorist events of
September 11, 2001, and the subsequent temporary shutdown of U.S. air space,
Southwest temporarily suspended its normal refund policy in order to provide
the highest Service to the Company’s Customers, including the refunding of
nonrefundable tickets upon Customer request. As a result, the Company
experienced refunds during September 2001 and through December 2001 far above
historical refund levels and in excess of the Company’s contractual
obligations. In evaluating passenger revenue through third quarter 2001, based
on these unusually high refund levels, the Company estimated that approximately
$30 million of these refunds related to
revenue previously recognized for estimated forfeited tickets. As a result, the
Company reduced third quarter 2001 “Passenger revenue” by $30 million and
restored “Air traffic liability”, accordingly.

Subsequent to third quarter 2001 and through second quarter 2002, the Company
experienced a higher than historical mix of discount, nonrefundable ticket
sales. The Company also experienced changes in Customer travel patterns
resulting from various factors, including new airport security measures,
concerns about further terrorist attacks, and an uncertain economy.
Consequently, the Company recorded $36 million in additional passenger revenue
in second quarter 2002 as Customers required fewer refunds and exchanges,
resulting in more forfeited tickets. During 2003, refund, exchange, and
forfeiture activity returned to more historic, pre-September 11, 2001,
patterns.

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $10.6 billion of
long-lived assets, including $8.6 billion in flight equipment and related
assets. In accounting for long-lived assets, the Company must make estimates
about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of
the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the
assets and the cash flows they generate.

The following table shows a breakdown of the Company’s long-lived asset groups
along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of
these groups:

Estimated

%

Leasehold improvements

5 years or lease term


%

* The Company’s remaining 737-200’s, due to be retired by first quarter
2005, have residual values of 2%

In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the
Company has primarily relied upon actual experience with the same or similar
aircraft types and recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of the
Company’s aircraft. Aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of
“cycles” flown (a “cycle” is one take-off and landing). The Company has made a
conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated
future utilization of the aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these estimates,
which can be significant, could be caused by changes to the Company’s



maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft (actual cycles
during a given period of time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and
changing market prices of new and used aircraft
of the same or similar types. The Company evaluates its estimates and
assumptions each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates
and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a
prospective basis through depreciation expense, as required by GAAP.

When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment.
Factors that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not
limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived
asset(s), a significant change in the long-lived asset’s physical condition,
and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived
asset. While the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these
indicators, Southwest has continued to operate all of its aircraft and
continues to experience positive cash flow. Consequently, the Company has not
identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company
will continue to monitor its long-lived assets and the airline operating
environment.

Financial Derivative Instruments

The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage its risk
associated with changing jet fuel prices, and accounts for them under Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133). See “Qualitative and
Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more information on these risk
management activities and see Notes 2 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for more information on SFAS 133, the Company’s fuel hedging
program, and financial derivative instruments.

SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be marked to market (fair value) and
recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the Company’s
financial derivative instruments recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 2003, was $251 million. The financial derivative
instruments utilized by the Company primarily were a combination of collars,
purchased call options, and fixed price swap agreements. The Company does not
purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes.

The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party
institutions in “over-the-counter” markets. Since the majority of the
Company’s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange,
the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of instrument,
the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard
option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those
observed in underlying markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward
market for jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in
order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting
changes to those prices, as required by SFAS 133. Forward jet fuel prices are
estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as
crude oil and heating oil) and adjusted based on historical variations to those
like commodities.

Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices
are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments
settle, and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed, respectively.
However, once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the
hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and prices are known and
are recognized in the financial statements. Based on these actual results once
all values and prices become known, the Company’s estimates have proved to be
materially accurate. Furthermore, since the majority of the Company’s hedges
settle within 12 to 24 months from the time the Company enters into the
contract for the derivative financial instrument, the estimates being made are
relatively short-term.



Estimating the fair value of these fuel hedging derivatives and forward prices
for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period
and thus determine how they are accounted for
under SFAS 133. To the extent that the period to period change in the
estimated fair value of a fuel hedging instrument differs from a period to
period change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be
purchased, ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge will result, as defined by SFAS
133. This could result in the immediate recording of charges or income, even
though the derivative instrument may not expire until a future period.
Historically, the Company has not experienced significant ineffectiveness in
its fuel hedges accounted for under SFAS 133.

SFAS 133 is a complex accounting standard with stringent requirements including
the documentation of a Company hedging strategy, statistical analysis to
qualify a commodity for hedge accounting both on a historical and a prospective
basis, and strict contemporaneous documentation that is required at the time
each hedge is executed by the Company. As required by SFAS 133, the Company
assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly
basis. The Company also examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging
program on a quarterly basis utilizing statistical analysis. This analysis
involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses that compare
changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities
used for hedging purposes (crude oil and heating oil).

The Company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of
interest rate swap agreements. During second quarter 2003, the Company entered
into interest rate swap agreements relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior
unsecured notes due March 1, 2012, and $375 million 5.496% Class A-2
pass-through certificates due November 1, 2006. Under the first interest rate
swap agreement, the Company pays the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus
a margin every six months and receives 6.5% every six months on a notional
amount of $385 million until March 1, 2012. Under the second agreement, the
Company pays LIBOR plus a margin every six months and receives 5.496% every six
months on a notional amount of $375 million until November 1, 2006.

The Company’s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges, as
defined by SFAS 133. In addition, these interest rate swap agreements qualify
for the “shortcut” method of accounting for hedges, as defined by SFAS 133.
Under the “shortcut” method, the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective,
and thus, there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings. The fair
value of the interest rate swap agreements, which are adjusted regularly, are
recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as necessary, with a corresponding
adjustment to the carrying value of the long-term debt. The fair value of the
interest rate swap agreements, excluding accrued interest, at
December 31, 2003,
was a liability of approximately $18 million. This amount is recorded in
“Other deferred liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance
with fair value hedging, the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the
carrying value of long-term debt. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Some statements in this Form 10-K (or otherwise made by the Company or on the
Company’s behalf from time to time in other reports, filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, conferences, World Wide Web
postings or otherwise) which are not historical facts, may be “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
statements include statements about Southwest’s estimates, expectations,
beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, and the assumptions
underlying these forward-looking statements. Southwest uses the words
“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “forecasts,”
“may,” “will,” “should,” and similar expressions to identify these
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve



risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
historical experience or
the Company’s present expectations. Factors that could cause these differences
include, but are not limited to:

Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the Company’s
forward-looking statements, which represent the Company’s views only as of the
date this report is filed. The Company undertakes no obligation to update
publicly or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
information, future events, or otherwise.

ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and
interest rate swaps, and has commodity price risk in jet fuel required to
operate its aircraft fleet. The Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing
market prices, but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a
documented hedging strategy. Southwest has market sensitive instruments in the
form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used
to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company also operates
96 aircraft under operating and capital leases. However, leases are not
considered market sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not
included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments related
to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on the



Company’s accounting for its hedging program and Note 10 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further details on the Company’s financial derivative
instruments.

Fuel hedging. The Company utilizes its fuel hedges as a form of insurance
against significant increases in fuel prices. The Company believes there is
significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price
increases. The Company expects to consume 1.2 billion gallons of jet fuel in
2004. Based on this usage, a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per
gallon would impact the Company’s “Fuel and oil expense” by approximately $12
million per year.

The fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the
Company’s jet fuel market price risk at December 31, 2003, were net assets of
$251 million. The current portion of these financial derivative instruments,
or $164 million, is classified as “Fuel hedge contracts” in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The long-term portion of these financial derivative
instruments, or $87 million, is included in “Other assets.” The fair values of
the derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, were
determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with
assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying
markets. An immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying
fuel-related commodity prices from the December 31, 2003, prices would
correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments
in place by approximately $125 million. Changes in the related commodity
derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount
based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax
effects. This sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and
holds all inputs constant at December 31, 2003, levels, except underlying
futures prices.

Financial market risk. Airline operators are inherently capital intensive as
the vast majority of the Company’s assets are expensive aircraft, which are
long-lived. The Company’s strategy is to capitalize conservatively and grow
capacity steadily and profitably. While the Company uses financial leverage,
it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an “A” credit rating on its senior
unsecured fixed-rate debt with Standard & Poor’s and Fitch ratings agencies,
and a “Baa1” credit rating with Moody’s rating agency. The Company’s Aircraft
Secured Notes and French Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair
value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are
floating-rate debt. In addition, as disclosed in Note 10 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, during 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap
agreements relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due March
1, 2012, and $375 million 5.496% Class A-2 pass-through certificates due
November 1, 2006. Due to these transactions, the Company considers these debts
to also be at floating rates. Although there is interest rate risk associated
with these floating rate borrowings, the risk for the Aircraft Secured Notes
and French Credit Agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the Company
may prepay this debt on any of the semi-annual principal and interest payment
dates. See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more
information on the material terms of the Company’s short-term and long-term
debt.

Excluding the $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes that were converted to a
floating rate as previously noted, the Company had outstanding senior unsecured
notes totaling $300 million at December 31, 2003. These senior unsecured notes
currently have a weighted-average maturity of 9.3 years at fixed rates
averaging 7.75 percent at December 31, 2003, which is comparable to average
rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years. The
fixed-rate portion of the Company’s pass-through certificates consists of its
Class A certificates and Class B certificates, which totaled $193 million at
December 31, 2003. These Class A and Class B certificates had a
weighted-average maturity of 2.3 years at fixed rates averaging 5.58 percent at
December 31, 2003. The carrying value of the Company’s floating rate debt
totaled $964 million, and this debt had a weighted-average maturity of 4.6
years at floating rates averaging 1.47 percent at December 31, 2003. In total,



the Company’s fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented 6.5 percent
and 13.0 percent, respectively, of total noncurrent assets at December 31,
2003.

The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to
the short-term nature of its invested cash, which totaled $1.9 billion at
December 31, 2003. The Company invests available cash in certificates of
deposit, highly rated money markets, investment grade commercial paper, and
other highly rated financial instruments. Because of the short-term nature of
these investments, the returns earned parallel closely with short-term floating
interest rates. The Company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover
interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market
interest rate risk management activities.

A hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of December 31,
2003, would not have a material effect on the fair value of the Company’s fixed
rate debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for further information on the fair value of the Company’s financial
instruments. A change in market interest rates could, however, have a
corresponding effect on the Company’s earnings and cash flows associated with
its floating rate debt, invested cash, and short-term investments because of
the floating-rate nature of these items. Assuming floating market rates in
effect as of December 31, 2003, were held constant throughout a 12-month
period, a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly
change the Company’s net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by
less than $1 million. Utilizing these assumptions and considering the
Company’s cash balance, short-term investments, and floating-rate debt
outstanding at December 31, 2003, an increase in rates would have a net
positive effect on the Company’s earnings and cash flows, while a decrease in
rates would have a net negative effect on the Company’s earnings and cash
flows. However, a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the
Company’s earnings or cash flow associated with the Company’s publicly traded
fixed-rate debt.

The Company is also subject to various financial covenants included in its
credit card transaction processing agreement, the revolving credit facility,
and outstanding debt agreements. Covenants included the maintenance of minimum
credit ratings and minimum asset fair values. The Company met or exceeded the
minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of December 31, 2003.
However, if conditions change and the Company failed to meet the minimum
standards set forth in the agreements, it could reduce the availability of cash
under the agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact as
written.

DECEMBER 31, 2003

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest) is a major
domestic airline that provides predominantly shorthaul, high-frequency,
point-to-point, low-fare service. The Consolidated Financial Statements
include the accounts of Southwest and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the
Company). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from these estimates.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash in excess of that necessary for operating
requirements is invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing
investments. Investments with maturities of three months or less are classified
as cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of certificates of
deposit, money market funds, and investment grade commercial paper issued by
major corporations and financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents are
stated at cost, which approximates market value.

INVENTORIES Inventories of flight equipment expendable parts, materials,
and supplies are carried at average cost. These items are generally charged to
expense when issued for use.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method
to estimated residual values over periods generally ranging from 20 to 25 years
for flight equipment and 5 to 30 years for ground property and equipment once
the asset is placed in service. Residual values estimated for aircraft are 15
percent, except for 737-200 aircraft, which will be retired from the Company’s
fleet by the end of first quarter 2005. The estimated residual value for these
aircraft is two percent, based on current market values. Residual value
percentages for ground property and equipment range from zero to 10 percent.
Property under capital leases and related obligations are recorded at an amount
equal to the present value of future minimum lease payments computed on the
basis of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate or, when known, the interest
rate implicit in the lease. Amortization of property under capital leases is
on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in depreciation
expense.

In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the
Company has primarily relied upon actual experience with the same or similar
aircraft types and recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of the
Company’s aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be
significant, could be caused by changes to the Company’s maintenance program,
changes in utilization of the aircraft (actual flight hours or cycles during a
given period of time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, changing
market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types, etc. The
Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and, when
warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these
adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation
expense, as required by GAAP.

When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets used in
operations for impairment. Impairment losses would be recorded when events and
circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired and the undiscounted
cash flows to be generated by that asset are less than the carrying amounts of
the asset. Factors that would indicate potential impairment include, but are
not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived
asset(s), a significant change in the long-lived asset’s



physical condition, operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of
the long-lived asset, etc. While the airline industry as a whole has
experienced many of these indicators, Southwest has continued to operate all of
its aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow.

AIRCRAFT AND ENGINE MAINTENANCE The cost of scheduled engine inspections
and repairs and routine maintenance costs for aircraft and engines are charged
to maintenance expense as incurred. Scheduled airframe inspections and
repairs, known as D checks, are generally performed every ten years. Costs
related to D checks are capitalized and amortized over the estimated period
benefited, presently the least of ten years, the time until the next D check,
or the remaining life of the aircraft. Modifications that significantly
enhance the operating performance or extend the useful lives of aircraft or
engines are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the asset.

In 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants issued a Draft Statement of Position entitled
“Accounting for Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant, and
Equipment” (Draft SOP). Among other items, the Draft SOP, as written, would
require that all D checks be expensed as incurred beginning in 2005. See
Recent Accounting Developments for further information.

REVENUE RECOGNITION Tickets sold are initially deferred as “Air traffic
liability”. Passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided.
“Air traffic liability” primarily represents tickets sold for future travel
dates and estimated refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel
dates. The majority of the Company’s tickets sold are nonrefundable. Tickets
that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another
flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or refunded (if the ticket is
refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused.
The Company estimates the amount of future refunds and exchanges, net of
forfeitures for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed. These
estimates are based on historical experience over many years. The Company and
members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting
method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel is
provided. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic
liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and
exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the Company’s revenue recognition
method with respect to forfeited tickets.

Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical
Customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds, exchanges or forfeited
tickets differing significantly from estimates; however, these differences have
historically not been material. Additional factors that may affect estimated
refunds, exchanges, and forfeitures include, but may not be limited to, the
Company’s refund and exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable
fares, and fare sale activity. The Company’s estimation techniques have been
consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates, actual
refund and exchange activity may vary from estimated amounts.

Subsequent to third quarter 2001 and through second quarter 2002, the Company
experienced a higher than historical mix of discount, nonrefundable ticket
sales. The Company also experienced changes in Customer travel patterns
resulting from various factors, including new airport security measures,
concerns about further terrorist attacks, and an uncertain economy.
Consequently, the Company recorded $36 million in additional passenger revenue
in second quarter 2002 as Customers required fewer refunds and exchanges,
resulting in more forfeited tickets. During 2003, refund, exchange, and
forfeiture activity returned to more historic, pre-September 11, 2001,
patterns.

FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM The Company accrues the estimated incremental cost
of providing free travel for awards earned under its Rapid Rewards frequent
flyer program. The Company also sells frequent flyer credits and related
services to companies participating in its Rapid Rewards frequent flyer
program.



Funds received from the sale of flight segment credits and associated with
future travel are deferred and recognized as “Passenger revenue” when the
ultimate free travel awards are flown or the credits expire unused.

ADVERTISING The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 was
$155 million, $156 million, and $148 million, respectively.

STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION The Company has stock-based compensation
plans covering the majority of its Employee groups, including a plan covering
the Company’s Board of Directors and plans related to employment contracts with
certain Executive Officers of the Company. The Company accounts for
stock-based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance
with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25),
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related Interpretations.
Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for fixed option plans
because the exercise prices of Employee stock options equal or exceed the
market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Compensation
expense for other stock options is not material.

The following table represents the effect on net income and earnings per share
if the Company had applied the fair value based method and recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, to stock-based Employee
compensation:

As required, the pro forma disclosures above include options granted since
January 1, 1995. Consequently, the effects of applying SFAS 123 for providing
pro forma disclosures may not be representative of the effects on reported net
income for future years until all options outstanding are included in the pro
forma disclosures. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair
value of stock-based compensation plans and other options is amortized to
expense primarily over the vesting period. See Note 13 for further discussion
of the Company’s stock-based Employee compensation.



In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure”. SFAS No. 148 amends the transition
and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123. Among other items, SFAS 148 allows
companies adopting SFAS 123 to utilize one of three alternative transition
methods, one of which was a “prospective method”, as defined, that was only
available if adopted during 2003. To date, the Company has not adopted SFAS
123 utilizing any of the transition methods of SFAS 148. The FASB currently is
working on a project to develop a new standard for accounting for stock-based
compensation. Tentative decisions by the FASB indicate that expensing of stock
options will be required beginning January 1, 2005. The FASB expects to issue
an exposure draft, which will be subject to public comment, in first quarter
2004 and issue its final standard in the second half of 2004. See Note 13 for
further information on the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.

FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133), “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended, which governs the
way it accounts for financial derivative instruments. The Company utilizes
various derivative instruments, including both crude oil and heating oil based
derivatives, to hedge a portion of its exposure to jet fuel price increases.
These instruments consist primarily of purchased call options, collar
structures, and fixed price swap agreements. The Company has also entered into
interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt to
floating rates.

Since the majority of the Company’s financial derivative instruments are not
traded on a market exchange, the Company estimates their fair values.
Depending on the type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of
present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about
commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Also, since
there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel, the Company must estimate
the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the
hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required by SFAS
133. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar
commodity futures prices (such as crude oil and heating oil) and adjusted based
on historical variations to those like commodities. See Notes 2 and 10 for
further information on SFAS 133 and financial derivative instruments.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS In fourth quarter 2003, the Accounting
Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants released a Draft Statement of Position entitled “Accounting for
Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant, and Equipment” (Draft
SOP). The Draft SOP, which is expected to be issued in its final form in first
quarter 2004, would become effective for the Company January 1, 2005. The
primary areas of applicability of the Draft SOP to the Company are in the areas
of planned major maintenance activities (D checks) and component accounting.

As discussed in “Aircraft and Engine Maintenance”, the Company currently
capitalizes costs related to D checks and amortizes those costs over the
estimated period benefited, presently the least of ten years, the time until
the next D check, or the remaining life of the aircraft. In the Draft SOP, D
checks would be considered a planned major maintenance activity and, as such,
would be expensed as incurred. During 2003, the Company recorded $49 million in
“Depreciation expense” related to previously capitalized D checks, compared to
the $47 million in D check costs that were capitalized during 2003. These
amounts are not necessarily indicative of those experienced in previous periods
or to be expected in future periods, however, as maintenance schedules can vary
significantly from year to year. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has $185
million, net of related accumulated depreciation, in capitalized D checks
classified as “Flight equipment” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Upon the
expected adoption of the Draft SOP in 2005, any



remaining unamortized costs of planned major maintenance activities (D checks)
would be expensed as a cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment
(charge) in the first quarter of that year.

The Draft SOP also requires, among other things, management to establish a
level of “component” accounting, as defined, for property and equipment. The
Draft SOP defines a component as a tangible part of property or equipment that
is accounted for separately and is expected to provide benefit for more than
one year. Each component of property and equipment shall be depreciated over
its own separate useful life, and once it is replaced with a new component, any
remaining value would be written off to expense in the period of replacement.
Although the Company is still studying the Draft SOP as it relates to component
accounting, Southwest does not expect its future results of operation or
financial position to be materially affected by the application of component
accounting.

In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (FIN 46) which requires the consolidation of variable
interest entities, as defined. FIN 46, as revised, is applicable to financial
statements of companies that have interests in “special purpose entities”, as
defined, during 2003. FIN 46 is applicable to financial statements of
companies that have interests in all other types of entities, in first quarter
2004. However, disclosures are required currently if the Company expects to
consolidate any variable interest entities. The Company does not currently
believe that any material entities will be consolidated with Southwest as a
result of FIN 46.

2. ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133. SFAS 133 requires the
Company to record all financial derivative instruments on its balance sheet at
fair value. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to
fair value through income. If a derivative is designated as a hedge, depending
on the nature of the hedge, changes in its fair value that are considered to be
effective, as defined, either offset the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or are recorded in
“Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” until the hedged item is
recorded in earnings. Any portion of a change in a derivative’s fair value that
is considered to be ineffective, as defined, is recorded immediately in “Other
(gains) losses, net” in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Any portion of a
change in a derivative’s fair value that the Company elects to exclude from its
measurement of effectiveness is required to be recorded immediately in
earnings.

Under the rules established by SFAS 133, the Company has alternatives in
accounting for its financial derivative instruments. The Company primarily
uses financial derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price
increases and accounts for these derivatives as cash flow hedges, as defined.
In accordance with SFAS 133, the Company must comply with detailed rules and
strict documentation requirements prior to beginning hedge accounting. As
required by SFAS 133, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each of its
individual hedges on a quarterly basis. The Company also examines the
effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis utilizing
statistical analysis. This analysis involves utilizing regression and other
statistical analyses that compare changes in the price of jet fuel to changes
in the prices of the commodities used for hedging purposes (crude oil and
heating oil).

Upon adoption of SFAS 133, the Company recorded the fair value of its fuel
derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a deferred gain of
$46 million, net of tax, in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)”.
See Note 11 for further information on Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). During 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company recognized $16 million in
additional income, $5 million in additional income, and $8 million in expense,
respectively, in “Other (gains) losses, net”, related to the ineffectiveness of
its hedges. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company recognized approximately
$29 million, $26 million, and $18 million, respectively, of net expense,
related to amounts excluded from



the Company’s measurements of hedge effectiveness, in “Other (gains) losses,
net”. The 2001 adoption of SFAS 133 has resulted in more volatility in the
Company’s financial statements than in the past due to the changes in market
values of its derivative instruments and some ineffectiveness that has been
experienced in its fuel hedges. See Note 10 for further information on the
Company’s derivative instruments.

3. FEDERAL GRANTS AND SPECIAL CHARGES RELATED TO TERRORIST ATTACKS

On September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked and used two American Airlines, Inc.
aircraft and two United Air Lines, Inc. aircraft in terrorist attacks on the
United States (terrorist attacks). As a result of these terrorist attacks, the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) immediately suspended all commercial
airline flights. From September 11 until the Company resumed flight operations
on September 14, Southwest cancelled approximately 9,000 flights.

On September 22, 2001, President Bush signed into law the Air Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act (Stabilization Act). The Stabilization Act
provided for up to $5 billion in cash grants to qualifying U.S. airlines and
freight carriers to compensate for direct and incremental losses, as defined in
the Stabilization Act, from September 11, 2001, through December 31, 2001,
associated with the terrorist attacks. Each airline’s total eligible grant was
determined based on that airline’s percentage of available seat miles (ASMs)
during August 2001 to total eligible carriers’ ASMs for August 2001, less an
amount set aside for eligible carriers for whom the use of an ASM formula would
result in an insufficient representation of their share of direct and
incremental losses.

In 2001, the Department of Transportation (DOT) made a determination of the
amount of eligible direct and incremental losses incurred by Southwest, and the
Company was allotted 100 percent of its eligible grants, totaling $283 million.
The Company recognized $235 million in “Other gains” from grants under the
Stabilization Act during the second half of 2001 and recognized an additional
$48 million as “Other gains” from grants under the Stabilization Act in third
quarter 2002 coincident with the receipt of its final payment. Representatives
of the DOT or other governmental agencies may perform additional audit and/or
review(s) of the Company’s previously submitted final application. While the
Stabilization Act is subject to significant interpretation as to what
constitutes direct and incremental losses, management believes the Company’s
eligible direct and incremental losses are sufficient to retain 100 percent of
its eligible grant following additional audits or reviews, should they occur.

The Company recorded total special charges of $48 million in 2001 arising from
the terrorist attacks, which included a $30 million reduction in “Passenger
revenue.” Following the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, and the
subsequent temporary shutdown of U.S. air space, Southwest temporarily
suspended its normal refund policy in order to provide the highest Service to
the Company’s Customers, including refunding nonrefundable tickets upon
Customer request. As a result, the Company’s refunds during September 2001 and
through December 2001 were far above historical refund levels and in excess of
the Company’s contractual obligations. Refunds are recorded as a reduction in
“Air traffic liability.” Based on these unusually high refunds, the Company
estimated that approximately $30 million of these refunds related to revenue
previously recognized for estimated forfeited tickets. As a result, the
Company reduced third quarter 2001 “Passenger revenue” by $30 million and
restored “Air traffic liability” accordingly. Total special charges also
included $13 million in “Other operating expenses”, primarily related to
write-downs of various assets due to impairment. Other miscellaneous charges
totaling approximately $5 million were also included in “Other (gains) losses,
net.”

On April 16, 2003, as a result of the United States war with Iraq, the
Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (Wartime Act) was signed into
law. Among other items, the legislation included a $2.3 billion government
grant for airlines. Southwest received $271 million as its proportional share
of



the grant during second quarter 2003. This amount is included in “Other
(gains) losses” in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statement for 2003.
Also as part of the Wartime Act, the Company received approximately $5 million
as a reimbursement for the direct cost of reinforcing cockpit doors on all of
the Company’s aircraft. The Company accounted for this reimbursement as a
reduction of capitalized property and equipment.

4. COMMITMENTS

The Company’s contractual purchase commitments consist primarily of scheduled
aircraft acquisitions from Boeing. The Company has contractual purchase
commitments with Boeing for 46 737-700 aircraft deliveries in 2004 (plus one
leased aircraft to be delivered new from a third party), 28 scheduled for
delivery in 2005, 22 in 2006, 25 in 2007, and 6 in 2008. In addition, the
Company has options to purchase up to 52 737-700s during 2005-2008 and purchase
rights for an additional 217 737-700s during 2007-2012. The Company has the
option, which must be exercised two years prior to the contractual delivery
date, to substitute 737-600s or 737-800s for the 737-700s. As of December 31,
2003, aggregate funding needed for firm commitments is approximately $3.2
billion, subject to adjustments for inflation, due as follows: $1.2 billion in
2004, $776 million in 2005, $645 million in 2006, $524 million in 2007, and $95
million in 2008.

In November 2001, in response to decreased demand for air travel following the
terrorist attacks, the Company modified its schedule for future aircraft
deliveries to defer the acquisition of 19 new 737-700 aircraft that were either
already in production at Boeing or were scheduled to be built through April
2002. The Company accomplished this by entering into a trust arrangement with
a special purpose entity (the Trust) and assigned its purchase agreement with
Boeing to the Trust with respect to the 19 aircraft originally scheduled for
delivery between September 2001 and April 2002. Southwest subsequently entered
into a purchase agreement with the Trust to purchase the aircraft at new
delivery dates from January 2002 to April 2003. The Trust was formed to
facilitate the financing of the Company’s near-term aircraft purchase
obligations with Boeing. The Trust purchased 11 of the aircraft in 2001 and
eight aircraft in 2002. For these 19 Trust aircraft, the Company recorded the
associated assets (“Flight equipment”) and liabilities (“Aircraft purchase
obligations”) in its financial statements as the aircraft were completed by
Boeing and delivered to the Trust. In the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows, the Trust’s receipt of these aircraft was recorded as “Purchases of
property and equipment” and “Proceeds from trust arrangement.” During 2002,
the Company accelerated the deliveries from the Trust and accepted delivery of
all 19 aircraft, thereby terminating the Trust. The receipt of the aircraft
from the Trust was reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as
“Payments of trust arrangement”. The cost of financing these aircraft
obligations, approximately $5 million, was expensed.

6. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

Following the terrorist attacks in September 2001, the Company borrowed the
full $475 million available under its unsecured revolving credit line with a
group of banks. Borrowings under the credit line bore interest at six-month
LIBOR plus 15.5 basis points. The Company repaid this unsecured revolving
credit line in full, plus accrued interest, in March 2002. This credit
facility was replaced in April 2002.

In April 2002, the Company entered into two unsecured revolving credit
facilities from which it can borrow up to $575 million from a group of banks.
One of the facilities, for half of the total amount, was renewed for an
additional year during April 2003. This facility now expires in April 2004.
The other facility, for half of the amount, expires in April 2005. At the
Company’s option, interest on the facilities can be calculated on one of
several different bases. For most borrowings, Southwest would anticipate
choosing a floating rate based upon LIBOR. If fully drawn, the spread over
LIBOR would be 75 basis points for both facilities given Southwest’s credit
ratings at December 31, 2003. The Company expects that it will be able to
renew the expiring 364-day facility for an additional 364-day period at
reasonable terms. If the Company is unable to renew, the Company’s available
credit facility will be reduced. As of December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002, there were no outstanding amounts borrowed under either facility.

In October 2003, the Company redeemed $100 million of senior unsecured 8 3/4%
Notes originally issued in 1991.

On March 1, 2002, the Company issued $385 million senior unsecured Notes
(Notes) due March 1, 2012. The Notes bear interest at 6.5 percent, payable
semi-annually beginning on September 1, 2002. Southwest used the net proceeds
from the issuance of the Notes, approximately $380 million, for general
corporate purposes, including the repayment of the Company’s credit facility in
March 2002. See Note 6. During 2003, the Company entered into an interest
rate swap agreement relating to these Notes. See Note 10 for further
information.

On October 30, 2001, the Company issued $614 million Pass Through Certificates
consisting of $150 million 5.1% Class A-1 certificates, $375 million 5.5% Class
A-2 certificates, and $89 million 6.1% Class B certificates. A separate trust
was established for each class of certificates. The trusts used the proceeds
from the sale of certificates to acquire equipment notes, which were issued by
Southwest on a full recourse basis. Payments on the equipment notes held in
each trust will be passed through to the holders



of certificates of such trust.
The equipment notes were issued for each of 29 Boeing 737-700 aircraft owned
by Southwest and are secured by a mortgage on such aircraft. Interest on the
equipment notes held for the certificates is payable semiannually, beginning
May 1, 2002. Beginning May 1, 2002, principal payments on the equipment notes
held for the Class A-1 certificates are due semiannually until the balance of
the certificates mature on May 1, 2006. The entire principal of the equipment
notes for the Class A-2 and Class B certificates are scheduled for payment on
November 1, 2006. During 2003, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement relating to the $375 million 5.5% Class A-2 certificates. See Note
10 for further information.

In fourth quarter 1999, the Company issued $200 million of floating rate
Aircraft Secured Notes (the Notes), due November 2004. The Notes are funded by
a bank through a commercial paper conduit program and are secured by eight
aircraft. Interest rates on the Notes are based on the conduit’s actual
commercial paper rate, plus fees, for each period and are expected to average
approximately LIBOR plus 36 basis points over the term of the Notes. Interest
is payable monthly and the Company can prepay the Notes in whole or in part
prior to maturity. The Company prepaid $25 million of the Notes during 2002.

Also in fourth quarter 1999, the Company entered into two identical 13-year
floating rate financing arrangements, whereby it effectively borrowed a total
of $56 million from French banking partnerships. For presentation purposes,
the Company has classified these identical borrowings as one $56 million
transaction. The effective rate of interest over the 13-year term of the loans
is LIBOR plus 32 basis points. Principal and interest are payable
semi-annually on June 30 and December 31 for each of the loans and the Company
may terminate the arrangements in any year on either of those dates, with
certain conditions. The Company has pledged two aircraft as collateral for the
transactions.

On February 28, 1997, the Company issued $100 million of senior unsecured 7
3/8% Debentures due March 1, 2027. Interest is payable semi-annually on March
1 and September 1. The Debentures may be redeemed, at the option of the
Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption
price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the Debentures plus
accrued interest at the date of redemption or the sum of the present values of
the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon, discounted
to the date of redemption at the comparable treasury rate plus 20 basis points,
plus accrued interest at the date of redemption.

During 1995, the Company issued $100 million of senior unsecured 8% Notes due
March 1, 2005. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1.
The Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity.

During 1992, the Company issued $100 million of senior unsecured 7 7/8% Notes
due September 1, 2007. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and
September 1. The Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity.

The net book value of the assets pledged as collateral for the Company’s
secured borrowings, primarily aircraft and engines, was $893 million at
December 31, 2003.

As of December 31, 2003, aggregate annual principal maturities (not including
interest on capital leases) for the five-year period ending December 31, 2008
were $206 million in 2004, $143 million in 2005, $542 million in 2006, $114
million in 2007, $5 million in 2008, and $556 million thereafter.



8. LEASES

The Company had seven aircraft classified as capital leases at December 31,
2003. The amounts applicable to these aircraft included in property and
equipment were:

Total rental expense for operating leases charged to operations in 2003, 2002,
and 2001 was $386 million, $371 million, and $359 million, respectively. The
majority of the Company’s terminal operations space, as well as 89 aircraft,
were under operating leases at December 31, 2003. Future minimum lease
payments under capital leases and noncancelable operating leases with initial
or remaining terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2003, were:

The aircraft leases generally can be renewed at rates based on fair market
value at the end of the lease term for one to five years. Most aircraft leases
have purchase options at or near the end of the lease term at fair market
value, generally limited to a stated percentage of the lessor’s defined cost of
the aircraft.

9. CONSOLIDATION OF RESERVATIONS CENTERS

In November 2003, the Company announced the consolidation of its nine
Reservations Centers into six, effective February 28, 2004. This decision was
made in response to the established shift by Customers to the internet as a
preferred way of booking travel. The Company’s website, www.southwest.com, is
now
responsible for more than half of ticket bookings and, as a consequence, demand
for phone contact has dramatically decreased. The Company will close its
Reservations Centers located in Dallas, Texas, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Little
Rock, Arkansas. The Company is giving the 1,900 affected Employees at these
locations the opportunity to relocate to another of the Company’s remaining six
centers. As of mid-January 2004, approximately 55 percent of these Employees
had notified the Company that they would not relocate. Employees choosing to
not relocate have been offered support packages, which include severance pay,
flight benefits, medical coverage, and job-search assistance, depending on
length of service with the Company. The costs associated with this decision,
primarily related to Employee severance packages and relocation expenses, will
be recognized primarily in first quarter 2004, in accordance with SFAS 146.



10. DERIVATIVE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fuel contracts - Airline operators are inherently dependent upon energy to
operate and, therefore, are impacted by changes in jet fuel prices. Jet fuel
and oil consumed in 2003, 2002, and 2001 represented approximately 15.2, 14.9
percent, and 15.6 percent of Southwest’s operating expenses, respectively. The
Company endeavors to acquire jet fuel at the lowest possible cost. Because jet
fuel is not traded on an organized futures exchange, liquidity for hedging is
limited. However, the Company has found that both crude oil and heating oil
contracts are effective commodities for hedging jet fuel. The Company has
financial derivative instruments in the form of the types of hedges it utilizes
to decrease its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company does not
purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments for both short-term and
long-term time frames when it appears the Company can take advantage of market
conditions. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had a mixture of purchased
call options, collar structures, and fixed price swap agreements in place to
hedge approximately 82 percent of its 2004 total anticipated jet fuel
requirements, approximately 60 percent of its 2005 total anticipated jet fuel
requirements, and portions of its 2006-2007 total anticipated jet fuel
requirements. As of December 31, 2003, the majority of the Company’s first
quarter 2004 hedges are effectively heating oil-based positions in the form of
option contracts. The majority of the remaining hedge positions are crude
oil-based positions.

During 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company recognized gains in “Fuel and oil”
expense of $171 million, $45 million, and $80 million, respectively, from
hedging activities. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately $19 million
and $13 million, respectively, due from third parties from expired derivative
contracts, is included in “Accounts and other receivables” in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company accounts for its fuel hedge derivative
instruments as cash flow hedges, as defined. Therefore, all changes in fair
value that are considered to be effective are recorded in “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)” until the underlying jet fuel is consumed. The
fair value of the Company’s financial derivative instruments at December 31,
2003, was a net asset of approximately $251 million. The current portion of
these financial derivative instruments is classified as “Fuel hedge contracts”
and the long-term portion is classified as “Other assets” in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The fair value of the derivative instruments, depending on the
type of instrument, was determined by the use of present value methods or
standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on
those observed in underlying markets.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $123 million in
unrealized gains, net of tax, in “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)” related to fuel hedges. Included in this total are approximately $83
million in net unrealized gains that are expected to be realized in earnings
during 2004.

Interest Rate Swaps - During second quarter 2003, the Company entered into
interest rate swap agreements relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior
unsecured notes due March 1, 2012, and $375 million 5.496% Class A-2
pass-through certificates due November 1, 2006. Under the first interest rate
swap agreement, the Company pays the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus
a margin every six months and receives 6.5% every six months on a notional
amount of $385 million until March 1, 2012. Under the second agreement, the
Company pays LIBOR plus a margin every six months and receives 5.496% every six
months on a notional amount of $375 million until November 1, 2006.

The Company’s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges, as
defined by SFAS 133. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements,
which are adjusted regularly, are recorded in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, as necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of
the



long-term debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements,
excluding accrued interest, at December 31, 2003, was a liability of
approximately $18 million. This amount is recorded in “Other deferred
liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with fair value
hedging, the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value
of long-term debt. See Note 7.

Outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the Company to credit loss
in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements.
However, the Company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet
their obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial instruments
is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the
reporting date. To manage credit risk, the Company selects and periodically
reviews counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single
counterparty, and monitors the market position of the program and its relative
market position with each counterparty. At December 31, 2003, the Company had
agreements with seven counterparties containing early termination rights and/or
bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk
exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or credit ratings fall below
certain levels. The Company is in the process of negotiating similar
agreements with other counterparties.

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s long-term debt
at December 31, 2003 were as follows:

The estimated fair values of the Company’s long-term debt were based on quoted
market prices. The carrying values of all other financial instruments
approximate their fair value.

11.     COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

Comprehensive income includes changes in the fair value of certain financial
derivative instruments, which qualify for hedge accounting, and unrealized
gains and losses on certain investments. Comprehensive income totaled $510
million, $327 million, and $479 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

12. COMMON STOCK

The Company has one class of common stock. Holders of shares of common stock
are entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the Board of
Directors and are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a
vote of the shareholders.

At December 31, 2003, the Company had common stock reserved for issuance
pursuant to Employee stock benefit plans (242 million shares authorized of
which 55 million shares have not yet been granted) and upon exercise of rights
(408 million shares) pursuant to the Common Share Purchase Rights Agreement, as

amended (Agreement).

Pursuant to the Agreement, each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock
is accompanied by one common share purchase right (Right). Each Right is
exercisable only in the event of a proposed takeover, as defined by the
Agreement. The Company may redeem the Rights at $.0022 per Right prior to the
time that 15 percent of the common stock has been acquired by a person or
group. The Agreement is not applicable to a fully-financed or cash tender
offer for all of the Company’s shares of common stock, which remains open for
at least 60 calendar days, is at a price equal to the higher of (a) 65% over
the average closing price of
the common stock during the 90 days preceding the offer and (b) the highest
closing price during the 52 weeks preceding the offer, and is accompanied by a
written fairness opinion of a nationally recognized investment banking firm.
If the Company is acquired, as defined in the Agreement, each Right will
entitle its holder to purchase for $3.29 that number of the acquiring company’s
or the Company’s



common shares, as provided in the Agreement, having a market
value of two times the exercise price of the Right. The Rights will expire no
later than July 30, 2005.

On January 18, 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a three-for-two
stock split, distributing 254 million shares on February 15, 2001. Unless
otherwise stated, all share and per share data presented in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been restated to give
effect to this stock split.

In January 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
up to $300 million of the Company’s common stock, utilizing present and

anticipated proceeds from the exercise of Employee stock options. Repurchases
will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market
or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions.

13.     STOCK PLANS

The Company has stock plans covering Employees subject to collective bargaining
agreements (collective bargaining plans) and stock plans covering Employees not
subject to collective bargaining agreements (other Employee plans.) None of
the collective bargaining plans were required to be approved by shareholders.
Options granted to Employees under collective bargaining plans are granted at
or above the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of
grant, generally have terms ranging from six to twelve years, and vest
primarily in accordance with the period covered by the respective collective
bargaining agreement. Neither Executive Officers nor members of the Company’s
Board of Directors are eligible to participate in any of these collective
bargaining plans. Options granted to Employees through other Employee plans
are granted at the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date
of grant, have ten-year terms, and vest and become fully exercisable over
three, five, or ten years of continued employment, depending upon the grant
type. All of these other Employee plans have been approved by shareholders
except the plan covering non-management, non-contract Employees, which had 7.6
million options outstanding to purchase the Company’s common stock as of
December 31, 2003, and an additional plan which is not available to Officers or
Board members, reserving 15 million shares for future grants.

Aggregated information regarding the Company’s fixed stock option plans, as
adjusted for stock splits, is summarized below:

Under the amended 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which has been
approved by stockholders, as of December 31, 2003, the Company is authorized to
issue up to a remaining balance of 5.0 million shares of common stock to
Employees of the Company. These shares may be issued at a price equal to 90
percent of the market value at the end of each purchase period. Common stock
purchases are paid for through periodic payroll deductions. Participants under
the plan received 1.4 million shares in 2003, 1.4 million shares in 2002, and
1.0 million shares in 2001, at average prices of $14.04, $14.70, and $16.42,
respectively. The weighted-average fair value of each purchase right under the
ESPP granted in 2003, 2002, and 2001, which is equal to the ten percent
discount from the market value of the common stock at the end of each purchase
period, was $1.56, $1.63, and $1.82, respectively.

Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share, as
disclosed in Note 1, has been determined as if the Company had accounted for
its Employee stock-based compensation plans and other stock options under the
fair value method of SFAS 123. The fair value of each option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants under the
fixed option plans:






Wtd-average risk-free interest rate

2.6

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company’s Employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management’s opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its Employee stock options.

The fair value of options granted under the fixed option plans during 2003
ranged from $3.33 to $8.17. The fair value of options granted under the fixed
option plans during 2002 ranged from $3.54 to $8.52. The fair value of options
granted under the fixed option plans during 2001 ranged from $5.69 to $9.11.

14.     EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company has defined contribution plans covering substantially all of
Southwest’s Employees. The Southwest Airlines Co. Profitsharing Plan is a
money purchase defined contribution plan and Employee stock purchase plan. The
Company also sponsors Employee savings plans under section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code, which include Company matching contributions. The
401(k) plans cover substantially all Employees. Contributions under all
defined contribution plans are based primarily on Employee compensation and
performance of the Company.

Company contributions to all retirement plans expensed in 2003, 2002, and 2001
were $219 million, $156 million, and $215 million, respectively.

15.     INCOME TAXES

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The components of
deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2003 and 2002, are as
follows:



The provision for income taxes is composed of the following:

For the year 2002, Southwest Airlines Co. had a tax net operating loss of $163
million for federal income tax purposes. This resulted in a federal tax refund
due to utilization of this net operating loss as a carryback to prior taxable
years. This refund, estimated at $51 million at December 31, 2002, was
included in “Accounts and other receivables” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
at December 31, 2002 and was collected in 2003.

The effective tax rate on income before income taxes differed from the federal
income tax statutory rate for the following reasons:

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regularly examines the Company’s federal
income tax returns and, in the course of which, may propose adjustments to the
Company’s federal income tax liability reported on such returns. It is the
Company’s practice to vigorously contest those proposed adjustments that it
deems lacking of merit. The Company’s management does not expect that the
outcome of any proposed adjustments presented to date by the IRS, individually
or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

16. NET INCOME PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of net income per share, basic
and diluted:

The Company has excluded 10 million, 11 million, and 6 million shares from its
calculations of net income per share, diluted, in 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively, as they represent antidilutive stock options for the respective
periods presented.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southwest
Airlines Co. as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Southwest
Airlines Co. at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2001 the Company changed
its method of accounting for derivative financial instruments.

PART III

Item 10.

Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant

The information required by Item 401 of Regulation S-K regarding
directors is included under “Election of Directors” in the definitive
Proxy Statement for Southwest’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be
held May 19, 2004 and is incorporated herein by reference. The
information required by Item 401 of Regulation S-K regarding executive
officers is included under “Executive Officers of the Registrant” in
Part I following Item 4 of this Report. The information required by Item
405 of Regulation S-K is included under “Section 16(a) Beneficial
Ownership Reporting Compliance” in the definitive Proxy Statement for
Southwest’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held May 19, 2004 and
is incorporated herein by reference.

In the wake of well-publicized corporate scandals, the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange have issued
multiple new regulations, requiring the implementation of policies and
procedures in the corporate governance area. Since beginning business
in 1971, Southwest has thrived on a culture which encourages an
entrepreneurial spirit in its Employees, and has emphasized personal
responsibility, initiative, and the use of independent, good judgment.
The Golden Rule is one of the core values, and there is a “top-down”
insistence on the highest ethical standards at all times.

In complying with new regulations requiring the institution of
policies and procedures, it has been the goal of Southwest’s Board of
Directors and senior leadership to do so in a way which does not inhibit
or constrain Southwest’s unique culture, and which does not unduly
impose a bureaucracy of forms and checklists. Accordingly, formal,
written policies and procedures have been adopted in the simplest
possible way, consistent with legal requirements. The Company’s
Corporate Governance Guidelines, its charters for each of its
Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, and a
revised charter for its Audit Committee and its Code of Ethics covering
all Employees are available on the Company’s website,
www.southwest.com, and a copy will be mailed upon request to Sr.
Director — Investor Relations, Southwest Airlines Co., P.O. Box 36611,
Dallas, TX 75235. The Company intends to disclose any amendments to or
waivers of the Code of Ethics on behalf of the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and persons performing
similar functions on the Company’s website, at www.southwest.com under



the “About SWA” caption, promptly following the date of such amendment
