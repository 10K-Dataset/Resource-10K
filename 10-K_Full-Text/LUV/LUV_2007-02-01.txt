PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Southwest Airlines Co. is a major passenger airline that
    provides scheduled air transportation in the United States.
    Based on the most recent data available from the Department of
    Transportation, Southwest Airlines is the largest carrier in the
    United States, as measured by originating passengers boarded and
    scheduled domestic departures. Southwest was incorporated in
    Texas in 1967 and commenced Customer Service on June 18,
    1971, with three Boeing 737 aircraft serving three Texas
    cities — Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. At
    year-end 2006, Southwest operated 481 Boeing 737 aircraft and
    provided service to 63 cities in 32 states throughout
    the United States. During 2006, the Company began service to
    Denver, Colorado, and Washington Dulles International Airport.
    The terms “Southwest,” the “Company,”
    “we,” “us,” and similar terms refer to
    Southwest Airlines Co. and its subsidiaries.

Southwest focuses principally on

point-to-point,

rather than

hub-and-spoke,

service, providing its markets with frequent, conveniently timed
    flights and low fares. At December 31, 2006, Southwest
    served 397 nonstop city pairs. Historically, Southwest has
    served predominantly short-haul routes, with high frequencies.
    In recent years, the Company has complemented this service with
    more medium to long-haul routes, including transcontinental
    service.

One of Southwest’s primary competitive strengths is its low
    operating costs. Southwest has the lowest costs, adjusted for
    stage length, on a seat mile basis, of all the major airlines.
    Among the factors that contribute to its low cost structure are
    a single aircraft type, an efficient, high-utilization,

point-to-point

route structure, and hardworking, innovative, and highly
    productive Employees.

The business of the Company is somewhat seasonal. Quarterly
    operating income and, to a lesser extent, revenues tend to be
    lower in the first quarter (January 1 -
    March 31) and fourth quarter (October 1 -
    December 31) of most years.

Fuel

The cost of fuel is an item that has significant impact on the
    Company’s results of operations. The Company’s average
    cost of jet fuel, net of hedging gains and excluding fuel taxes,
    over the past five years was as follows:

    detail below under “Risk Factors” and
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

Regulation

Economic.

•

Department of Transportation.

The Department
    of Transportation (“DOT”) has significant regulatory
    jurisdiction over passenger airlines. To provide passenger
    transportation in the United States, a domestic airline is
    required to hold a certificate of public convenience and
    necessity issued by the DOT. A certificate is unlimited in
    duration and generally permits the Company to operate among any
    points within the United States, its territories and
    possessions. The DOT may revoke a certificate, in whole or in
    part, for intentional failure to comply with federal aviation
    statutes, regulations, orders, or the terms of the certificate
    itself. The DOT also has jurisdiction over certain economic and
    consumer protection matters such as advertising, denied boarding
    compensation, baggage liability, and access for persons with
    disabilities. The DOT may impose civil penalties on air carriers
    for violations of its regulations in these areas.

•

Wright Amendment.

The International Air
    Transportation Competition Act of 1979, as amended (the
    “Act”), includes restrictions on the provision of air
    transportation to and from Dallas Love Field. The applicable
    portion of the Act, commonly known as the “Wright
    Amendment,” as it affects Southwest’s scheduled
    service, has prohibited carrying nonstop and through passengers
    on commercial flights between Dallas Love



Field and all states outside of Texas, with the exception of the
    states of Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
    Missouri, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, which will be referred to as
    “Wright Amendment States.” Flights between Dallas Love
    Field and the Wright Amendment States have been permitted only
    when an airline has not offered or provided any through service
    or ticketing with another air carrier at Dallas Love Field and
    has not offered service to or from any point that was outside of
    a Wright Amendment State. The Wright Amendment does not restrict
    flights operated with aircraft having 56 or fewer passenger
    seats. In addition, the Wright Amendment does not restrict
    Southwest’s intrastate Texas flights or its air service
    from points other than Dallas Love Field.

In the third quarter of 2006, Southwest entered into an
    agreement with the City of Dallas, the City of Fort Worth,
    American Airlines, Inc., and the DFW International Airport
    Board. Pursuant to this agreement, the five parties sought
    enactment of legislation to amend the Act. On October 13,
    2006, Congress responded by passing the Wright Amendment Reform
    Act of 2006 (the “Reform Act”), which provides for,
    among other things, (1) substantial repeal of the Wright
    Amendment in 2014, (2) immediate repeal of through service
    and ticketing restrictions, so that Customers can purchase a
    single ticket between Dallas Love Field and any
    U.S. destination (while still requiring the Customer’s
    flight to make a stop in a Wright Amendment State), and
    (3) reduction of the maximum number of gates available for
    commercial air service at Dallas Love Field from 32 to 20.
    Southwest currently uses 14 gates at Dallas Love Field. Pursuant
    to the Reform Act and local agreements with the City of Dallas
    with respect to gates, Southwest can expand scheduled service
    from Dallas Love Field and intends to do so.

Safety and Health.

The Company and its
    third-party maintenance providers are subject to the
    jurisdiction of the Federal Aviation Administration
    (“FAA”) with respect to the Company’s aircraft
    maintenance and operations, including equipment, ground
    facilities, dispatch, communications, flight training personnel,
    and other matters affecting air safety. To ensure compliance
    with its regulations, the FAA requires airlines to obtain
    operating, airworthiness, and other certificates, which are
    subject to suspension or revocation for cause. The Company has
    obtained such certificates. In addition, pursuant to FAA
    regulations, the Company has established, and the FAA has
    approved, the Company’s operations specifications and a
    maintenance program for the Company’s aircraft, ranging
    from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls. The FAA,
    acting through its own powers or through the appropriate
    U.S. Attorney, also has the power to bring proceedings for
    the imposition and collection of fines for violation of the
    Federal Air Regulations.

The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and
    local laws and regulations relating to occupational safety and
    health, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration
    and Food and Drug Administration regulations.

Security.

Pursuant to the Aviation and
    Transportation Security Act (the “Aviation Security
    Act”), the Transportation Security Administration
    (“TSA”), a division of the Department of Homeland
    Security, is responsible for certain civil aviation security
    matters. The Aviation Security Act mandated, among other things,
    improved flight deck security, deployment of federal air
    marshals onboard flights, improved airport perimeter access
    security, airline crew security training, enhanced security
    screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees, and
    vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security
    screening personnel, additional provision of passenger data to
    U.S. Customs, and enhanced background checks. Under the
    Aviation Security Act, substantially all security screeners at
    airports are federal employees, and significant other elements
    of airline and airport security are overseen and performed by
    federal employees, including federal security managers, federal
    law enforcement officers, and federal air marshals. Under the
    Aviation Security Act, funding for passenger security is
    provided in part by a $2.50 per enplanement security fee,
    subject to a maximum of $5.00 per one-way trip. The
    Aviation Security Act also allows the TSA to assess an Aviation
    Security Infrastructure Fee on each airline up to the total
    amount spent by that airline on passenger and property screening
    in calendar year 2000. Southwest was assessed a fee, and
    recorded expense, totaling approximately $50 million in
    each of 2005 and 2006 (of which approximately $24 million
    in each year is being contested by Southwest). Like the FAA, the
    TSA may impose and collect fines for violations of its
    regulations.

Enhanced security measures have had, and will continue to have,
    a significant impact on the airport experience for passengers.
    While these security requirements have not impacted aircraft
    utilization, they have impacted our business. In particular, the
    third quarter of 2006 presented challenges to the airline
    industry due to new security measures mandated by the TSA, as a
    result



of a terrorist plot uncovered by authorities in London. The
    stringent new rules, mostly regarding the types of liquid items
    that can be carried onboard the aircraft, had a negative impact
    on air travel beginning in mid-August, especially on shorthaul
    routes and with business travelers. Although the TSA has relaxed
    some of the requirements for carryon luggage, the Company is not
    able to predict the ongoing impact, if any, that these security
    changes will have on passenger revenues, both in the shortterm
    and the longterm.

The Company has invested significantly in facilities, equipment,
    and technology to process Customers efficiently and restore the
    airport experience. The Company’s Automated Boarding Passes
    and

E-Ticket

Check-In self service kiosks, which the Company has implemented
    in all airports it serves, have reduced the number of lines in
    which a Customer must wait. The Company has also installed gate
    readers at all of its airports to improve the boarding
    reconciliation process and offers baggage checkin through

E-Ticket

Check-In kiosks at certain airport locations, as well as
    Internet checkin and transfer boarding passes at the time of
    checkin.

Environmental.

The Airport Noise and Capacity
    Act of 1990 gives airport operators the right, under certain
    circumstances, to implement local noise abatement programs, so
    long as they do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or
    foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. Some
    airports, including San Diego and Orange County, California
    have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including
    restrictions on aircraft types to be used, and limits on the
    number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such
    operations. In some instances, these restrictions have caused
    curtailments in service or increases in operating costs, and
    such restrictions could limit the ability of Southwest to expand
    its operations at the affected airports. Local authorities at
    other airports may consider adopting similar noise regulations,
    but such regulations are subject to the provisions of the
    Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 and regulations
    promulgated thereunder.

Operations at John Wayne Airport, Orange County, California, are
    governed by the Airport’s Phase 2 Commercial Airline
    Access Plan and Regulation (the “Plan”). Pursuant to
    the Plan, each airline is allocated total annual seat capacity
    to be operated at the airport, subject to renewal/reallocation
    on an annual basis. Service at this airport may be adjusted
    annually to meet these requirements.

The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and
    local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
    environment, including the discharge or disposal of materials
    such as chemicals, hazardous waste, and aircraft deicing fluid.
    Regulatory developments pertaining to such things as control of
    engine exhaust emissions from ground support equipment and
    prevention of leaks from underground aircraft fueling systems
    could increase operating costs in the airline industry. The
    Company does not believe, however, that such environmental
    regulatory developments will have a material impact on the
    Company’s capital expenditures or otherwise adversely
    affect its operations, operating costs, or competitive position.
    Additionally, in conjunction with airport authorities, other
    airlines, and state and local environmental regulatory agencies,
    the Company is undertaking voluntary investigation or
    remediation of soil or groundwater contamination at several
    airport sites. The Company does not believe that any
    environmental liability associated with such sites will have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s operations, costs,
    or profitability.

Customer Service Commitment.

From time to
    time, the airline transportation industry has been faced with
    possible legislation dealing with certain Customer Service
    practices. As a compromise with Congress, the industry, working
    with the Air Transport Association, has responded by adopting
    and filing with the DOT written plans disclosing how it would
    commit to improving performance. Southwest Airlines’
    Customer Service Commitment is a comprehensive plan which
    embodies the Mission Statement of Southwest Airlines: dedication
    to the highest quality of Customer Service delivered with a
    sense of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and Company
    Spirit. The Customer Service Commitment can be reviewed by
    clicking on “About Southwest” at

www.southwest.com

. The DOT and Congress monitor the
    industry’s plans, and there can be no assurance that
    legislation or regulations will not be proposed in the future to
    regulate airline Customer Service practices.

Operations
    and Marketing

Operating Strategies.

Southwest focuses
    principally on

point-to-point,

rather than

hub-and-spoke,

service, providing its markets with frequent, conveniently timed
    flights and low fares. Southwest’s average aircraft trip
    stage length in 2006 was 622 miles with an average duration
    of approximately 1.7 hours, as compared to an average
    aircraft trip stage length of 607 miles and an average
    duration of approximately 1.7 hours in 2005. Examples of
    markets offering frequent daily flights are: Dallas to Houston
    Hobby, 30 weekday roundtrips; Phoenix to Las Vegas,
    19 weekday roundtrips; and Los Angeles International to
    Oakland, 22 weekday



roundtrips. Southwest complements these high-frequency shorthaul
    routes with longhaul nonstop service between markets such as
    Baltimore and Los Angeles, Phoenix and Tampa Bay, Las Vegas and
    Orlando, and Houston and Oakland.

Most major U.S. airlines have adopted the

“hub-and-spoke”

system, which concentrates most of an airline’s operations
    at a limited number of hub cities and serves most other
    destinations in the system by providing one-stop or connecting
    service through the hub. Southwest focuses on nonstop, not
    connecting, traffic over its

point-to-point

route system. The

point-to-point

route system, as compared to

hub-and-spoke,

allows for more direct nonstop routings for our Customers and,
    therefore, minimizes connections, delays, and total trip time.
    As a result, approximately 79 percent of the Company’s
    Customers fly nonstop.

Southwest serves many conveniently located secondary or downtown
    airports such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Chicago
    Midway, Baltimore-Washington International, Burbank, Manchester,
    Oakland, San Jose, Providence,
    Ft. Lauderdale/Hollywood, and Long Island Islip airports,
    which are typically less congested than other airlines’ hub
    airports. This operating strategy enables the Company to achieve
    high asset utilization because aircraft can be scheduled to
    minimize the amount of time they are at the gate (currently
    approximately 25 minutes). This in turn reduces the number of
    aircraft and gate facilities that would otherwise be required.
    The Company is also able to simplify scheduling, maintenance,
    flight operations, and training activities by operating only one
    aircraft type, the Boeing 737. All of these strategies enhance
    the Company’s ability to sustain high Employee productivity
    and reliable ontime performance.

Introduction of Codesharing.

In first quarter
    2005, Southwest began its first codeshare arrangement, with ATA
    Airlines. Under its codeshare arrangement with ATA, Southwest
    may market and sell tickets for certain flights on ATA that are
    identified by Southwest’s designator code (for example,
    “WN Flight 123”). Conversely, ATA may market and sell
    tickets under its code designator (TZ) for certain flights on
    Southwest Airlines. Any flight bearing a Southwest code
    designator that is operated by ATA is disclosed in
    Southwest’s reservations systems and on the Customer’s
    flight itinerary, boarding pass, and ticket, if a paper ticket
    is issued. As a result of the ATA codeshare, Southwest’s
    Customers are able to purchase single ticket service on
    Southwest connecting to ATA’s service to Hawaii, New
    York’s LaGuardia Airport, and Washington Reagan National
    Airport. Also, members of Southwest’s and ATA’s
    respective frequent flier programs are able to earn and redeem
    awards in the other carrier’s program. Finally, beginning
    in 2006, Southwest began selling ATA-only service at
    www.southwest.com. Other than the ATA arrangement, Southwest
    does not interline or offer joint fares with other airlines, nor
    does Southwest have any marketing or commuter feeder
    relationships with other carriers.

Simplified Fare Structure.

Southwest employs a
    relatively simple fare structure, featuring low, unrestricted,
    unlimited, everyday coach fares, as well as even lower fares
    available on a restricted basis. As of November 1, 2006,
    the Company’s highest non-codeshare, oneway unrestricted
    walkup fare offered was $319 for any flight. Even lower walkup
    fares are available on Southwest’s short and medium haul
    flights.

Ticketless Travel.

Southwest was the first
    major airline to introduce a Ticketless travel option,
    eliminating the need to print and then process a paper ticket
    altogether, and the first to offer Ticketless travel through the
    Company’s home page on the Internet, at

www.southwest.com

. For the year ended December 31,
    2006, more than 94 percent of Southwest’s Customers
    chose the Ticketless travel option and over 70 percent of
    Southwest’s passenger revenues came through its Internet
    site, which has become a vital part of the Company’s
    distribution strategy. The Company has not paid commissions to
    travel agents for sales since December 15, 2003.

Competition

The airline industry is highly competitive. We believe the
    principal competitive factors in the industry are:

•

Fares

•

Customer Service

•

Costs

•

Frequency and convenience of scheduling

•

Frequent flyer benefits

•

Efficiency and productivity, including effective selection and
    use of aircraft

We currently compete with other airlines on all of our routes,
    some of which airlines have larger fleets and some of which
    airlines may have wider name recognition in some markets.
    Certain major U.S. airlines have established marketing or
    codesharing alliances with each other, including Northwest
    Airlines/Continental Airlines/Delta Air Lines; American
    Airlines/Alaska



Airlines; and United Airlines/US Airways. These alliances are
    more extensive than ours and enable the carriers to expand their
    destinations and marketing opportunities. The Company is also
    subject to varying degrees of competition from surface
    transportation in its shorthaul markets, particularly the
    private automobile. In shorthaul air services that compete with
    surface transportation, price is a competitive factor, but
    frequency and convenience of scheduling, facilities,
    transportation safety and security procedures, and Customer
    Service are also of great importance to many passengers.

The competitive landscape for airlines has changed significantly
    over the last few years. Following the terrorist attacks on
    September 11, 2001, the airline industry, as a whole,
    incurred substantial losses through 2005. The war in Iraq and
    significant increases in the cost of fuel have exacerbated
    industry challenges. As a result, a number of carriers have
    sought relief from financial obligations in bankruptcy,
    including UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines; ATA
    Airlines; US Airways; Northwest Airlines Corporation, the parent
    of Northwest Airlines; and Delta Air Lines. UAL Corporation and
    ATA Airlines emerged from bankruptcy in 2006.
    US Airways’ emergence from bankruptcy in 2005
    culminated in its merger with America West Airlines in September
    of that year. Northwest Airlines Corporation and Delta Air Lines
    remain under the protection of bankruptcy proceedings. Other,
    smaller carriers have ceased operations entirely. In addition,
    post-9/11, many carriers shrank capacity, grounded their most
    inefficient aircraft, cut back on unprofitable service, and
    furloughed employees. Reorganization in bankruptcy has allowed
    carriers to decrease operating costs through renegotiated labor,
    supply, and financing contracts. As a result of those events, as
    well as actions taken by some carriers outside of bankruptcy,
    differentials in cost structures between traditional

hub-and-spoke

carriers and low cost carriers have significantly diminished.
    Nevertheless, throughout this entire time period, Southwest has
    continued to maintain its cost advantage, improve Employee
    productivity, pursue steady, controlled growth, and provide
    outstanding Service to its Customers. The factors discussed
    above have, however, led to more intense competition in the
    airline industry generally. Some carriers reported profitable
    results in one or more quarters in 2006 for the first time since
    9/11.

The re-emerging competitiveness of some of the larger carriers,
    such as United, US Airways, and American, has put pressure on
    smaller carriers such as AirTran Airways, JetBlue, and Frontier.
    AirTran Airways and JetBlue have announced scaled back growth
    plans, and many carriers have expressed interest in industry
    consolidation. For example, US Airways is pursuing a merger with
    Delta Air Lines, and AirTran Airways has recently announced an
    unsolicited offer for Midwest Airlines. The Company cannot
    predict the timing or extent of any such consolidation or its
    impact (either positive or negative) on the Company’s
    operations or results of operations.

Insurance

The Company carries insurance of types customary in the airline
    industry and at amounts deemed adequate to protect the Company
    and its property and to comply both with federal regulations and
    certain of the Company’s credit and lease agreements. The
    policies principally provide coverage for public and passenger
    liability, property damage, cargo and baggage liability, loss or
    damage to aircraft, engines, and spare parts, and workers’
    compensation.

Following the terrorist attacks, commercial aviation insurers
    significantly increased the premiums and reduced the amount of
    war-risk coverage available to commercial carriers. The federal
    Homeland Security Act of 2002 requires the federal government to
    provide third party, passenger, and hull war-risk insurance
    coverage to commercial carriers through a period of time that
    has now been extended to August 31, 2007. The Company is
    unable to predict whether the government will extend this
    insurance coverage past August 31, 2007, whether
    alternative commercial insurance with comparable coverage will
    become available at reasonable premiums, and what impact this
    will have on the Company’s ongoing operations or future
    financial performance.

Frequent
    Flyer Awards

Southwest’s frequent flyer program, Rapid Rewards, is based
    on trips flown rather than mileage. Rapid Rewards Customers earn
    a credit for each one-way trip flown or two credits for each
    roundtrip flown. Rapid Rewards Customers can also receive
    credits by using the services of non-airline partners, which
    include car rental agencies, hotels, telecommunication
    companies, and credit card partners, including the Southwest
    Airlines
    Chase

®

Visa card. Rapid Rewards offers two types of travel awards. The
    Rapid Rewards Award Ticket (“Award Ticket”) offers one
    free roundtrip award valid to any destination available on
    Southwest after the accumulation of 16 credits. The Rapid
    Rewards Companion Pass (“Companion Pass”) is granted
    for flying 50 roundtrips (or 100 one-way trips) on
    Southwest or earning 100 credits within a consecutive
    twelve-month period. The Companion Pass offers unlimited free
    roundtrip



travel to any destination available on Southwest for a
    designated companion of the qualifying Rapid Rewards member. For
    the designated companion to use this pass, the Rapid Rewards
    member must purchase a ticket or use an Award Ticket.
    Additionally, the Rapid Rewards member and designated companion
    must travel together on the same flight.

Award Tickets and Companion Passes are automatically generated
    when earned by the Customer rather than allowing the Customer to
    bank credits indefinitely. Award Tickets are valid for
    12 months after issuance. Award Tickets issued before
    February 10, 2006 have no seat restrictions, but are
    subject to published “Black out” dates. Effective
    February 10, 2006, systemwide “Black out” dates
    for Award Tickets were eliminated, but Award Tickets are subject
    to seat restrictions. Companion travel has no seat restrictions
    or “Black out” dates.

The Company also sells credits to business partners including
    credit card companies, hotels, telecommunication companies, and
    car rental agencies. These credits may be redeemed for Award
    Tickets having the same program characteristics as those earned
    by flying. Southwest’s codeshare agreement with ATA
    Airlines offers Customers of each airline the opportunity to
    earn and redeem frequent flier award credits on the other.

Customers redeemed approximately 2.7 million,
    2.6 million, and 2.5 million Award Tickets and flights
    on Companion Passes during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
    The amount of free travel award usage as a percentage of total
    Southwest revenue passengers carried was 6.4 percent in
    2006, 6.6 percent in 2005, and 7.1 percent in 2004.
    The number of fully earned Award Tickets and partially earned
    awards outstanding at December 31, 2006 was approximately
    10.1 million, of which approximately 81 percent were
    partially earned awards. The number of fully earned Award
    Tickets and partially earned awards outstanding at
    December 31, 2005 was approximately 6.8 million, of
    which approximately 78 percent were partially earned
    awards. However, due to the expected expiration of a portion of
    credits making up partial awards, not all of them will
    eventually turn into useable Award Tickets. Also, not all Award
    Tickets will be redeemed for future travel. Since the inception
    of Rapid Rewards in 1987, approximately 14 percent of all
    fully earned Award Tickets have expired without being used. The
    number of Companion Passes for Southwest outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately 58,000 and
    60,000, respectively. The Company currently estimates that an
    average of 3 to 4 trips will be redeemed per outstanding
    Companion Pass.

The Company accounts for its frequent flyer program obligations
    by recording a liability for the estimated incremental cost of
    flight awards the Company expects to be redeemed. The estimated
    incremental cost includes direct passenger costs such as fuel,
    food, and other operational costs, but does not include any
    contribution to overhead or profit. Revenue from the sale of
    credits to business partners and associated with future travel
    is deferred and recognized when the ultimate free travel award
    is flown or the credits expire unused. The liability for free
    travel awards earned but not used at December 31, 2006 and
    2005 was not material.

Employees

At December 31, 2006, Southwest had 32,664 active
    Employees, consisting of 12,954 flight, 2,056 maintenance,
    13,446 ground, Customer, and fleet service and 4,208 management,
    accounting, marketing, and clerical personnel.



Southwest has ten collective bargaining agreements, which
    agreements covered approximately 82 percent of
    Southwest’s Employees as of December 31, 2006. Our
    relations with labor unions are governed by the Railway Labor
    Act (the “RLA”), which establishes the right of
    airline employees to organize and bargain collectively. Under
    the RLA, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline
    and a labor union generally does not expire, but instead becomes
    amendable as of a stated date. If either party wants to modify
    the terms of such agreement, it must notify the other party in
    the manner required by the RLA

and/or

described in the agreement. After receipt of such notice, the
    parties must meet for direct negotiations, and, if no agreement
    is reached, either party may request the National Mediation
    Board (the “NMB”) to appoint a federal mediator. If no
    agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may determine that an
    impasse exists and offer binding arbitration to the parties. If
    either party rejects binding arbitration, a

30-day

“cooling off” period begins. At the end of this

30-day

period, the parties may engage in “self-help,” unless
    a Presidential Emergency Board is established to investigate and
    report on the disputes. The appointment of a Presidential
    Emergency Board maintains the “status quo” for an
    additional 60 days. If the parties do not reach agreement
    during this period, the parties may then engage in
    “self-help.” “Self-help” includes, among
    other things, a strike by the union or the airline’s
    imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the
    hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers. The
    following table sets forth the Company’s Employee groups

Risk
    Factors

In addition to the other information contained in this

Form 10-K,

the following risk factors should be considered carefully in
    evaluating Southwest’s business. The Company’s
    business, financial condition, or results of operations could be
    materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional
    risks not presently known to the Company or that the Company
    currently deems immaterial may also impair its business and
    operations.

Southwest’s
    business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft
    fuel. Continued periods of high fuel costs

and/or

significant disruptions in the supply of fuel, could adversely
    affect our results of operations.

Airline operators are inherently dependent upon energy to
    operate and, therefore, are impacted by changes in jet fuel
    prices. The cost of fuel, which was at an historically high
    level over the last two years, is largely unpredictable and has
    a significant impact on the Company’s results of
    operations. Jet fuel and oil consumed for fiscal 2006 and 2005
    represented approximately 26 percent and 20 percent of
    Southwest’s operating expenses, respectively. Fuel
    availability, as well as pricing, is also



impacted by political and economic factors. We do not currently
    anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability;
    however, it is difficult to predict the future availability of
    jet fuel due to the following, among other, factors: dependency
    on foreign imports of crude oil and the potential for
    hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas; limited
    refining capacity; and the possibility of changes in
    governmental policies on jet fuel production, transportation,
    and marketing. Significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft
    fuel could have a negative impact on the Company’s
    operations and results of operations.

Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, the
    Company’s ability to increase fares is limited, and it is
    not certain that future fuel cost increases can be covered by
    increasing fares. From time to time the Company enters into fuel
    derivative contracts to protect against rising fuel costs.
    Changes in the Company’s overall fuel hedging strategy, the
    ability of the commodities used in fuel hedging (principally
    crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline) to qualify for
    special hedge accounting, and the effectiveness of the
    Company’s fuel hedges pursuant to highly complex accounting
    rules, are all significant factors impacting the Company’s
    results of operations. For more information on Southwest’s
    fuel hedging arrangements, see “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations,” and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Southwest’s
    business is labor-intensive; we could be adversely affected if
    we are unable to maintain satisfactory relations with any
    unionized or other Employee work group.

The airline business is labor intensive. Wages, salaries, and
    benefits represented approximately 37 percent of the
    Company’s operating expenses for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. In addition, as of December 31,
    2006, approximately 82 percent of the Company’s
    Employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by
    labor unions. The Company’s Ramp, Operations, Provisioning,
    and Freight Agents are subject to an agreement with the
    Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO (“TWU”),
    which becomes amendable on June 30, 2008. However, under
    certain conditions, TWU could elect to give notice to the
    Company by June 1, 2007, of its desire to make the
    agreement amendable on June 30, 2007. During second quarter
    2006, TWU membership voted to not make the contract amendable on
    June 30, 2007. The Company is unable to predict whether
    future votes between now and June 2007 would result in the same
    outcome. The Company’s Pilots are subject to an agreement
    with the Southwest Airlines Pilots’ Association
    (“SWAPA”), which became amendable during September
    2006. The Company and SWAPA recently began discussions on a new
    agreement. Although, historically, the Company’s
    relationships with its Employees have been good, the following
    items could have a significant impact on the Company’s
    results of operations: results of labor contract negotiations,
    employee hiring and retention rates, pay rates, outsourcing
    costs, the impact of work rules, and costs for health care.

Southwest’s
    business is affected by many changing economic and other
    conditions beyond its control.

Our business, and the airline industry in general, is
    particularly impacted by changes in economic and other
    conditions that are largely outside of our control, including,
    among others:

•

Actual or potential changes in international, national,
    regional, and local economic, business, and financial
    conditions, including recession, inflation, interest rate
    increases, war, terrorist attacks, and political instability;

•

Changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns,
    or demographic trends;

•

Actual or potential disruptions in the air traffic control
    system;

•

Increases in costs of safety, security, and environmental
    measures; and

•

Weather and natural disasters.

Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the
    number of passengers carried, a relatively small change in the
    number of passengers can have a disproportionate effect on an
    airline’s operating and financial results. Therefore, any
    general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of
    any of these factors could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

Southwest
    relies on technology to operate its business, and any failure of
    these systems could harm the Company.

Southwest is increasingly dependent on automated systems and
    technology to operate its business, enhance Customer Service and
    back office support systems, and increase Employee productivity,
    including the Company’s computerized airline reservation
    system, flight operations systems, telecommunication systems,
    website at www.southwest.com, Automated Boarding Passes



system, and the

E-Ticket

Check-In self service kiosks. Any disruptions in these systems
    due to internal failures of technology or large-scale external
    interruptions in technology infrastructure, such as power,
    telecommunications, or the internet, could result in the loss of
    revenue or important data, increase the Company’s expenses,
    and generally harm the Company’s business. In addition, our
    growth strategies may be dependent on our ability to effectively
    implement technology advancements.

The
    travel industry continues to face on-going security concerns and
    cost burdens; further threatened or actual terrorist attacks, or
    other hostilities, could significantly harm our industry and our
    business.

The attacks of September 11, 2001, materially impacted, and
    continue to impact, air travel and the results of operations for
    Southwest and the airline industry generally. The Department of
    Homeland Security and the TSA have implemented numerous security
    measures that affect airline operations and costs. Substantially
    all security screeners at airports are now federal employees,
    and significant other elements of airline and airport security
    are now overseen and performed by federal employees, including
    federal security managers, federal law enforcement officers, and
    federal air marshals. Enhanced security procedures, including
    enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail,
    employees, and vendors, introduced at airports since the
    terrorist attacks of September 11 have increased costs to
    airlines and have from time to time impacted demand for air
    travel.

Additional terrorist attacks, even if not made directly on the
    airline industry, or the fear of such attacks or other
    hostilities (including elevated national threat warnings or
    selective cancellation or redirection of flights due to terror
    threats) could have a further significant negative impact on
    Southwest and the airline industry. The war in Iraq further
    decreased demand for air travel during the first half of 2003,
    and additional international hostilities could potentially have
    a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of
    operations.

Airport
    capacity constraints and air traffic control inefficiencies
    could limit the Company’s growth; changes in or additional
    governmental regulation could increase the Company’s
    operating costs or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to
    conduct business.

Almost all commercial service airports are owned

and/or

operated by units of local or state government. Airlines are
    largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide
    adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost.
    Similarly, the federal government singularly controls all
    U.S. airspace, and airlines are completely dependent on the
    FAA to operate that airspace in a safe, efficient, and
    affordable manner. As discussed above, under
    “Business — Regulation,” airlines are also
    subject to other extensive regulatory requirements. These
    requirements often impose substantial costs on airlines. Our
    results of operations may be affected by changes in law and
    future actions taken by governmental agencies having
    jurisdiction over our operations, including:

•

Increases in airport rates and charges;

•

Limitations on airport gate capacity or other use of airport
    facilities;

•

Increases in taxes;

•

Changes in the law that affect the services that can be offered
    by airlines in particular markets and at particular airports;

•

Restrictions on competitive practices;

•

The adoption of regulations that impact customer service
    standards, such as security standards; and

•

The adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise
    restrictions.

The
    airline industry is intensely competitive.

As discussed in more detail above under
    “Business — Competition,” the airline
    industry is extremely competitive. Southwest’s competitors
    include other major domestic airlines, as well as regional and
    new entrant airlines, and other forms of transportation,
    including rail and private automobiles. The Company’s
    revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers in the
    areas of capacity, pricing, scheduling, codesharing, and
    promotions.

Southwest’s
    low cost structure is one of its primary competitive advantages,
    and many factors could affect the Company’s ability to
    control its costs.

Factors affecting the Company’s ability to control its
    costs include the price and availability of fuel, results of
    Employee labor contract negotiations, Employee hiring and
    retention rates, costs for health care, capacity decisions by
    the Company and its competitors, unscheduled required aircraft
    airframe or engine repairs, regulatory requirements,
    availability of capital markets, and future financing decisions
    made by the Company.

Ground
    Facilities and Services

Southwest leases terminal passenger service facilities at each
    of the airports it serves, to which it has added various
    leasehold improvements. The Company leases land on a long-term
    basis for its maintenance centers located at Dallas Love Field,
    Houston Hobby, Phoenix Sky Harbor, and Chicago Midway, its
    training center near Dallas Love Field, which houses seven 737
    simulators, and its corporate headquarters, also located near
    Dallas Love Field. The maintenance, training center, and
    corporate headquarters buildings on these sites were built and
    are owned by Southwest. At December 31, 2006, the Company
    operated six reservation centers. The reservation centers
    located in Chicago, Albuquerque, and Oklahoma City occupy leased
    space. The Company owns its Houston, Phoenix, and
    San Antonio reservation centers.

Southwest has entered into a concession agreement with the Town
    of Islip, New York, which gives Southwest the right to
    construct, furnish, occupy, and maintain a new concourse at the
    airport. Phase I of this project, which began operations in
    August 2004, includes four gates. Phase II of the project,
    which includes an additional four gates, was completed in
    November 2006. The entire new concourse is now the property of
    the Town of Islip. In return for constructing the new concourse,
    Southwest is receiving fixed-rent abatements for a total of
    25 years; however, the Company is still be required to pay
    variable rents for common use areas and manage the new concourse.

The Company performs substantially all line maintenance on its
    aircraft and provides ground support services at most of the
    airports it serves. However, the Company has arrangements with
    certain aircraft maintenance firms for major component
    inspections and repairs for its airframes and engines, which
    comprise the majority of the Company’s annual aircraft
    maintenance costs.



Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

On December 8, 2005, Southwest Airlines Flight 1248 was
    involved in an accident at Chicago Midway Airport while the
    aircraft, a Boeing

737-700,

was
    landing. The aircraft overran the runway onto a roadway and
    collided with an automobile. Several occupants of the vehicles
    involved in the accident were injured, one fatally. The Company
    continues to cooperate fully with all federal, state, and local
    regulatory and investigatory agencies to determine the cause of
    this accident. The Company is currently unable to predict the
    amount of claims, if any, relating to this accident which may
    ultimately be made against it and how those claims might be
    resolved. At this time, the Company has no reason to believe
    that the costs to defend any claims and any potential liability
    exposure will not be covered by the insurance maintained by the
    Company. Consequently, the Company does not expect any
    litigation arising from the accident involving Flight 1248 to
    have a material adverse affect on the financial position or
    results of operations of the Company.

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims
    arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not
    limited to, examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
    The IRS regularly examines the Company’s federal income tax
    returns and, in the course of those examinations, proposes
    adjustments to the Company’s federal income tax liability
    reported on such returns. It is the Company’s practice to
    vigorously contest those proposed adjustments that it deems
    lacking merit. The Company’s management does not expect the
    outcome in any of its currently ongoing legal proceedings or the
    outcome of any proposed adjustments presented to date by the
    IRS, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Year in
    Review

Southwest recorded a profit of $499 million in 2006, an
    increase of $15 million, or 3.1 percent, compared to
    the Company’s 2005 net income of $484 million.
    Although the airline industry as a whole in 2006 was expected to
    report its first collective profit since 2000, Southwest’s
    string of consecutive profitable years has now reached 34, and
    the Company also extended its number of consecutive profitable
    quarters to 63, both of which are unmatched in the industry.

Southwest’s 2006 operating income was $934 million, an
    increase of $209 million, or 28.8 percent, compared to
    2005. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by
    strong revenues, especially during the first half of the year,
    and effective cost control measures. As a result of the
    extensive restructuring in the U.S. airline industry in
    2004 and 2005, several carriers reduced domestic capacity,
    resulting in fare increases and higher load factors for many
    airlines in 2006. In fact, Southwest’s 2006 load factor of
    73.1 percent was a company record. The Company modestly
    raised its fares over the course of the year, resulting in an
    increase in passenger revenue yield per RPM (passenger revenues
    divided by revenue passenger miles) of 6.9 percent compared
    to 2005. Unit revenue (total revenue divided by available seat
    miles) also increased a healthy 10.2 percent compared to
    2005 levels, as a result of the higher load factor and higher
    RPM yield.

The Company’s 2006 CASM (cost per available seat mile) was
    basically flat compared to 2005, excluding fuel. This was
    primarily a result of the Company’s continued focus on
    controlling non-fuel costs and attempting to offset wage rate
    and benefit increases through productivity and efficiency
    improvements. In addition, the Company’s headcount per
    aircraft at December 31, 2006 was 68, which was an
    improvement versus a year-ago level of 71. Furthermore, from the
    end of 2003 to the end of 2006, the Company’s headcount per
    aircraft decreased 20.0 percent, as the number of Employees
    remained virtually flat despite the net addition of 93 aircraft
    during that three year period. Including fuel expense, 2006 CASM
    increased 9.3 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to
    the 48.5 percent increase in the Company’s fuel cost
    per gallon, including the effects of hedging.

Significant events for Southwest

and/or

the
    airline industry during 2006 included:

* The Wright Amendment Reform Act of 2006 immediately lifted
    through-ticketing restrictions, so that Customers could purchase
    a single one-stop ticket between Dallas Love Field and any
    Southwest destination beyond the nine Wright Amendment states
    (to which nonstop Love Field service is permitted), and will
    eventually eliminate substantially all restrictions associated
    with the Wright Amendment in 2014. This Act also reduced the
    maximum number of available gates for commercial air service at
    Love Field from 32 to 20, of which the Company will
    ultimately lease 16. Dallas Love Field is a significant
    destination for Southwest as well as the location of the
    Company’s headquarters.

* The Department of Transportation announced that for
    August, September, and October 2006, Southwest carried the most
    passengers of any U.S. airline.

* Southwest began service to two new
    destinations — Denver, Colorado and Washington Dulles
    in northern Virginia.

* During 2006, Southwest was authorized by its Board of
    Directors to repurchase a total of $1.0 billion of its
    outstanding common stock. For the year ended December 31,
    2006, the Company repurchased 49.1 million shares for
    $800 million.

* The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) mandated
    new security measures as a result of a terrorist plot uncovered
    by authorities in London. The stringent new rules, mostly
    regarding the types of liquid items that can be carried onboard
    the aircraft, had a negative impact on air travel beginning in
    mid-August, especially on shorthaul routes and with business
    travelers. The Company estimated it lost more than
    $40 million in passenger revenue in August and September
    related to the security threat and these new restrictions.

* The price of jet fuel continued to be a significant
    factor for Southwest and other airlines. Despite the
    Company’s industry-leading fuel hedging program, which
    resulted in cash savings of $675 million in 2006, the
    Company’s jet fuel cost per gallon still increased by
    48.5 percent compared to 2005.

* The Company added 36

737-700

aircraft in 2006, bringing its fleet to 481 Boeing 737s at
    December 31, 2006.

As the Company experienced in 2006, it must continue to overcome
    higher jet fuel prices to grow profits. Based on current and
    projected energy prices for 2007 and expected growth plans, the
    Company



believes expenditures for jet fuel could increase between
    $400 million and $500 million compared to 2006, even
    including the effects of fuel derivative contracts the Company
    has in place as of January 2007. The Company’s fuel
    derivative contracts in place for 2007 provide protection for
    nearly 95 percent of the Company’s expected jet fuel
    consumption at an average price of approximately $50 per
    barrel of crude oil. The Company once again hopes to overcome
    the impact of higher anticipated 2007 fuel prices and other cost
    pressures through improved revenues and continued focus on
    non-fuel costs.

As Southwest moves into 2007, the Company believes its low-cost
    competitive advantage, protective fuel hedging position,
    excellent Employees, and strong balance sheet will allow
    Southwest to respond quickly to potential industry consolidation
    and to favorable market opportunities. The Company plans to add
    37 new

737-700

aircraft to its fleet in 2007, resulting in a net available seat
    mile (ASM) capacity increase of approximately eight percent.
    Based on these deliveries, the Company’s fleet will total
    518 737s by the end of 2007.

Results
    of Operations

    Compared With 2005

The Company’s consolidated net income for 2006 was
    $499 million ($.61 per share, diluted), as compared to
    2005 net income of $484 million ($.60 per share,
    diluted), an increase of $15 million, or 3.1 percent.
    Operating income for 2006 was $934 million, an increase of
    $209 million, or 28.8 percent, compared to 2005. The
    2006 increase in operating income was primarily due to higher
    revenues from the Company’s fleet growth, improved load
    factors, and higher fares, which more than offset a significant
    increase in the cost of jet fuel. The Company believes operating
    income provides a better indication of the Company’s
    financial performance for both 2006 and 2005 than does net
    income. This is due to the fact that, generally, certain gains
    and losses, recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended
    (SFAS 133), that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in
    future periods, are included in “Other (gains)
    losses,” which is below the operating income line, in both
    periods. In 2006, these adjustments, which are related to the
    ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for
    certain fuel derivatives and are included in “Other (gains)
    losses,” totaled net losses of $101 million. For 2005,
    these adjustments totaled net gains of $110 million.

Operating
    Revenues

Consolidated operating revenues increased $1.5 billion, or
    19.8 percent, primarily due to a $1.5 billion, or
    20.2 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase
    in passenger revenues primarily was due to an increase in
    capacity, an increase in RPM yield, and an increase in load
    factor. Approximately 45 percent of the increase in
    passenger revenue was due to the Company’s 8.8 percent
    increase in available seat miles compared to 2005. The Company
    increased available seat miles as a result of the addition of 36
    aircraft (all

737-700

aircraft). Approximately 35 percent of the increase in
    passenger revenue was due to the 6.9 percent increase in
    passenger yields. Average passenger fares increased
    11.4 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to less fare
    discounting because of the strong demand for air travel coupled
    with the availability of fewer seats as a result of industrywide
    domestic capacity reductions. The remainder of the passenger
    revenue increase primarily was due to the 2.4 point increase in
    the Company’s load factor compared to 2005. The
    73.1 percent load factor for 2006 represented the highest
    annual load factor in the Company’s history.

The airline revenue environment changed significantly from the
    first half of 2006 to the second half of the year. The Company
    believes this was due to both reduced demand related to domestic
    economic factors, as well as the effects of the increased
    carryon baggage restrictions put in place following the
    terrorist plot uncovered by London authorities in August 2006.
    The airline revenue environment regained some momentum during
    late fourth quarter 2006, and, despite growing capacity
    10 percent during the quarter, the Company achieved a
    record load factor of 70.2 percent at healthy yields, which
    resulted in a steady unit revenue growth rate of
    4.2 percent. Based upon traffic and bookings to date, the
    Company expects 2007 first quarter unit revenue growth to exceed
    first quarter 2006’s 9.15 cents per ASM.

Consolidated freight revenues increased slightly versus 2005. An
    $18 million, or 17.1 percent, increase in freight and
    cargo revenues, primarily as a result of higher rates charged,
    was almost entirely offset by lower mail revenues. The lower
    mail revenues were primarily due to the Company’s decision
    to discontinue carrying mail for the U.S. Postal Service
    effective as of the end of second quarter 2006. Due to this
    mid-year decision in 2006, the Company expects a

year-over-year

decrease in freight revenue for the first half of 2007.
    “Other revenues” increased $30 million, or
    17.4 percent, compared to 2005, primarily from higher
    commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with
    certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored
    Chase

®

Visa



card. The Company expects a similar increase in first quarter
    2007, also due to higher commissions earned.

Operating
    Expenses

Consolidated operating expenses for 2006 increased
    $1.3 billion, or 18.9 percent, compared to the
    8.8 percent increase in capacity. To a large extent,
    changes in operating expenses for airlines are driven by changes
    in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents Southwest’s
    operating expenses per ASM for 2006 and 2005 followed by
    explanations of these changes on a per-ASM basis:

9.3

%

Operating expenses per ASM increased 9.3 percent to 8.80
    cents, primarily due to an increase in jet fuel prices, net of
    gains from the Company’s fuel hedging program. The
    Company’s average cost per gallon of fuel increased
    48.5 percent versus the prior year. Excluding fuel,

year-over-year

CASM was basically flat with 2005. Based on current cost trends,
    the Company expects first quarter 2007 unit costs,
    excluding fuel, to increase from 2006’s full year figure of
    6.49 cents.

Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased
    .6 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase
    in average wage rates, mostly offset by productivity efforts
    that have enabled the Company to grow overall headcount at a
    rate that is less than the growth in ASMs. The Company’s
    headcount at December 31, 2006, was 2.9 percent higher
    than at December 31, 2005, despite the 8.8 growth in
    available seat miles. The Company expects a similar performance
    for salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM in first quarter 2007
    versus first quarter 2006, due to higher wage rates partially
    offset by a reduction in share-based compensation expense.

The Company’s Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, and Freight
    Agents are subject to an agreement with the Transport Workers
    Union of America, AFL-CIO (“TWU”), which becomes
    amendable on June 30, 2008. However, under certain
    conditions, TWU could elect to give notice to the Company by
    June 1, 2007, of its desire to make the agreement amendable
    on June 30, 2007. During second quarter 2006, TWU
    membership voted to not make the contract amendable on
    June 30, 2007. The Company is unable to predict whether
    future votes between now and June 2007 would result in the same
    outcome.

The Company’s Pilots are subject to an agreement with the
    Southwest Airlines Pilots’ Association (“SWAPA”),
    which became amendable during September, 2006. The Company and
    SWAPA recently began discussions on a new agreement.

Fuel and oil expense per ASM increased 46.2 percent, net of
    hedging gains, primarily due to a significant increase in the
    average jet fuel cost per gallon. Although the Company’s
    fuel hedge position was not as strong as the position the
    Company held in 2005, the Company’s hedging program still
    resulted in the realization of $675 million in cash
    settlements during 2006. These settlements resulted in a 2006
    reduction to Fuel and oil expense of $634 million. However,
    even with this hedge position, the Company’s jet fuel cost
    per gallon increased 48.5 percent versus 2005. The average
    cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2006 was $1.53 compared to $1.03
    in 2005, excluding fuel-related taxes and net of hedging gains.
    See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
    increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the
    Company has taken to improve the fuel efficiency of its
    aircraft, including the addition of blended winglets to all of
    the Company’s

737-700

aircraft. The Company has also announced it will install blended
    winglets on a significant number of its

737-300

aircraft, beginning in first quarter 2007.



The Company has benefited from the recent decline in energy
    prices and is currently 100 percent protected with fuel
    derivative instruments for its first quarter 2007 jet fuel
    purchase requirements. These instruments are at an average crude
    oil equivalent price of $50 per barrel, and the majority of
    these positions effectively perform like option
    contracts — allowing the Company to benefit in most
    cases from energy price decreases. Based on this protection and
    current market conditions, the Company expects its first quarter
    2007 jet fuel cost per gallon to be in the $1.65 to $1.70 range,
    excluding the impact of any hedge ineffectiveness and
    derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting as defined
    in SFAS 133. As of mid-January 2007, the Company had fuel
    derivative contracts in place for approximately 95 percent
    of its expected fuel consumption for the remainder of 2007 at
    approximately $50 per barrel; 65 percent in 2008 at
    approximately $49 per barrel; over 50 percent in 2009 at
    approximately $51 per barrel; over 25 percent in 2010
    at $63 per barrel; approximately 15 percent in 2011 at
    $64 per barrel, and 15 percent in 2012 at $63 per
    barrel.

Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM decreased
    1.9 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to a decrease
    in repair events for aircraft engines. Based on the number of
    scheduled repair events for both engines and airframes in first
    quarter 2007, the Company expects an increase in maintenance
    materials and repairs per ASM compared to the 2006 figure of 51
    cents.

Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 10.5 percent. The
    Company’s 8.8 percent increase in ASMs was generated
    by the 36 aircraft the Company acquired during 2006, all of
    which were purchased. The number of aircraft on operating lease
    remained the same. The Company currently expects a similar

year-over-year

comparison for first quarter 2007.

Landing fees and other rentals per ASM was flat compared to
    2005. The Company currently expects a

year-over-year

increase in landing fees and other rentals per ASM for first
    quarter 2007 primarily due to higher rates paid for airport
    space.

Depreciation expense per ASM increased 1.8 percent,
    primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense per ASM
    from 36 new

737-700

aircraft purchased during 2006 and the resulting higher
    percentage of owned aircraft. The Company currently expects a
    similar

year-over-year

comparison for first quarter 2007.

Other operating expenses per ASM increased 1.4 percent
    compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in
    revenue-related costs, such as credit card processing fees, from
    the Company’s 20.2 percent increase in passenger
    revenues. The Company currently expects a similar

year-over-year

comparison for first quarter 2007.

Other

“Other expenses (income)” included interest expense,
    capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and
    losses. Interest expense increased by $6 million, or
    4.9 percent, primarily due to an increase in floating
    interest rates. This was partially offset by the Company’s
    repayment of $607 million in debt during 2006. The majority
    of the Company’s long-term debt is at floating rates. In
    addition, the Company issued $300 million in senior
    unsecured notes during December 2006. Excluding the effect of
    any new debt offerings the Company may execute during 2007, the
    Company expects a reduction in interest expense compared to
    2006, primarily due to a lower average debt balance. See
    Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more
    information. Capitalized interest increased $12 million, or
    30.8 percent, compared to 2005 due to higher 2006 progress
    payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries as
    well as higher interest rates. Interest income increased
    $37 million, or 78.7 percent, primarily due to an
    increase in rates earned on cash and investments.

During 2006, the Company recognized approximately
    $52 million of expense related to amounts excluded from the
    Company’s measurements of hedge effectiveness (i.e., the
    premium cost of fuel derivative option contracts.) Also during
    2006, the Company recognized approximately $101 million of
    additional expense in “Other (gains) losses, net,”
    related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges and the loss of
    hedge accounting for certain contracts. In the second half of
    2006, both current and forward prices for the commodities
    Southwest uses for hedging jet fuel fell significantly,
    resulting in a reduction in the unrealized gains the Company had
    experienced in prior periods. Of this additional expense,
    approximately $42 million was unrealized,

mark-to-market

changes in the fair value of derivatives due to the
    discontinuation of hedge accounting for certain contracts that
    will settle in future periods; approximately $39 million
    was ineffectiveness associated with the change in value of
    hedges designated for future periods; and $20 million was
    ineffectiveness and

mark-to-market

losses related to the change in value of contracts that settled
    during 2006. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial
    statements for further information on the Company’s hedging
    activities. For 2005, the Company recognized approximately
    $35 million of expense related to amounts excluded from the
    Company’s measurements of hedge effectiveness and
    $110 million in



additional income related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges
    and unrealized

mark-to-market

changes in the fair value of certain derivative contracts.

The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before
    taxes, decreased to 36.8 percent in 2006 from
    37.9 percent in 2005. The decrease in the 2006 rate was
    primarily due to a $9 million reduction related to a
    revision in the State of Texas franchise tax law enacted during
    2006. The Company currently expects its 2007 effective rate to
    be approximately 38 percent.

    Compared With 2004

The Company’s consolidated net income for 2005 was
    $484 million ($.60 per share, diluted), as compared to
    2004 net income of $215 million ($.27 per share,
    diluted), an increase of $269 million, or
    125.1 percent. Operating income for 2005 was
    $725 million, an increase of $321 million, or
    79.5 percent, compared to 2004. The increase in operating
    income was primarily due to higher revenues from the
    Company’s fleet growth, improved load factors, and higher
    fares, which more than offset a significant increase in the cost
    of jet fuel. The larger percentage increase in net income
    compared to operating income primarily was due to variability in
    “Other (gains) losses,” due to unrealized 2005 gains
    resulting from the Company’s fuel hedging activities, in
    accordance with SFAS 133.

Operating
    Revenues

Consolidated operating revenues increased $1.1 billion, or
    16.1 percent, primarily due to a $1.0 billion, or
    15.9 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase
    in passenger revenues primarily was due to an increase in
    capacity, an increase in RPM yield, and an increase in load
    factor. Holding other factors constant (such as yields and load
    factor), almost 70 percent of the increase in passenger
    revenue was due to the Company’s 10.8 percent increase
    in available seat miles compared to 2004. The Company increased
    available seat miles as a result of the net addition of 28
    aircraft (33 new

737-700

aircraft net of five

737-200

aircraft retirements). Approximately 18 percent of the
    increase in passenger revenue was due to the 2.8 percent
    increase in passenger yields. Average passenger fares increased
    5.8 percent compared to 2004, primarily due to less fare
    discounting because of the strong demand for air travel coupled
    with the availability of fewer seats from industrywide domestic
    capacity reductions. The remainder of the passenger revenue
    increase primarily was due to the 1.2 point increase in the
    Company’s load factor compared to 2004.

Consolidated freight revenues increased $16 million, or
    13.7 percent. Approximately 65 percent of the increase
    was due to an increase in freight and cargo revenues, primarily
    due to higher rates charged on shipments. The remaining
    35 percent of the increase was due to higher mail revenues.
    The U.S. Postal Service periodically reallocates the amount
    of mail business given to commercial and freight air carriers
    and, during 2005, shifted more business to commercial carriers.
    Other revenues increased $39 million, or 29.3 percent,
    compared to 2004. Approximately 35 percent of the increase
    was from commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors
    with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored
    Chase

®

Visa card. An additional 35 percent of the increase was due
    to an increase in excess baggage charges, as the Company
    modified its fee policy related to the weight of checked baggage
    during second quarter 2005. Among other changes, the limit at
    which baggage charges apply was reduced to 50 pounds per checked
    bag.



Operating
    Expenses

Consolidated operating expenses for 2005 increased
    $733 million, or 12.0 percent, compared to the
    10.8 percent increase in capacity. To a large extent,
    changes in operating expenses for airlines are driven by changes
    in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents Southwest’s
    operating expenses per ASM for 2005 and 2004 followed by
    explanations of these changes on a per-ASM basis:

%

Operating expenses per ASM increased 1.0 percent to 8.05
    cents, primarily due to an increase in jet fuel prices, net of
    hedging gains. The Company was able to hold flat or reduce unit
    costs in every cost category, except fuel expense and other
    operating expense, through a variety of cost reduction and
    productivity efforts. These efforts, however, were entirely
    offset by the significant increase in the cost of fuel.
    Excluding fuel, CASM was 2.8 percent lower than 2004, at
    6.48 cents.

Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM decreased
    2.4 percent compared to 2004, primarily due to a reduction
    in share-based compensation expense, the majority of which is
    due to stock-options granted by the Company. As a result of the
    timing of grants in prior years and their related vesting
    provisions, share-based compensation expense decreased from
    $135 million in 2004 to $80 million in 2005. Excluding
    the impact of share-based compensation expense, salaries, wages,
    and benefits decreased slightly due to productivity efforts that
    enabled the Company to grow overall headcount at a rate that was
    less than the growth in ASMs. This decrease was partially offset
    by higher average wage rates, and higher profitsharing expense
    associated with the Company’s higher earnings.

Fuel and oil expense per ASM increased 21.5 percent,
    primarily due to a 24.8 percent increase in the average jet
    fuel cost per gallon, net of hedging gains. The average cost per
    gallon of jet fuel in 2005 was $1.03 compared to 82.8 cents in
    2004, excluding fuel-related taxes and net of hedging gains. The
    Company’s 2005 and 2004 average jet fuel costs are net of
    approximately $892 million and $455 million in gains
    from hedging activities, respectively. See Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in fuel prices
    was partially offset by steps the Company took to improve the
    fuel efficiency of its aircraft. These steps primarily included
    the addition of blended winglets to all of the Company’s

737-700

aircraft, and the upgrade of certain engine components on many
    aircraft. The Company estimates that these and other efficiency
    gains saved the Company approximately $70 million during
    2005, at average unhedged market jet fuel prices.

Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM decreased
    14.8 percent compared to 2004, primarily due to a decrease
    in repair events for aircraft engines.

Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 17.4 percent. Of the 33
    aircraft the Company acquired during 2005, all are owned. In
    addition, during 2005, the Company renegotiated the leases on
    four aircraft, and, as a result, reclassified these aircraft
    from operating leases to capital leases. These transactions
    increased the Company’s percentage of aircraft owned or on
    capital lease to 81 percent at December 31, 2005, from
    79 percent at December 31, 2004.

Depreciation expense per ASM decreased 1.8 percent. An
    increase in depreciation expense per ASM from 33 new

737-700

aircraft purchased during 2005 and the higher percentage of
    owned aircraft, was more than offset by lower expense associated
    with the Company’s retirement of its

737-200

fleet and all

737-200

remaining spare parts by the end of January 2005.

Other operating expenses per ASM increased 1.4 percent
    compared to 2004. Approximately 75 percent of the increase
    related to higher 2005 security fees in the form of a
    $24 million retroactive assessment the Company received
    from the Transportation Security Administration in January 2006.
    The remainder of the increase



primarily related to higher fuel taxes as a result of the
    substantial increase in fuel prices compared to 2004.

Other

“Other expenses (income)” included interest expense,
    capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and
    losses. Interest expense increased by $34 million, or
    38.6 percent, primarily due to an increase in floating
    interest rates. The majority of the Company’s long-term
    debt is at floating rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for more information. Capitalized interest
    was flat compared to 2004 as lower 2005 progress payment
    balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries were offset by
    higher interest rates. Interest income increased
    $26 million, or 123.8 percent, primarily due to an
    increase in rates earned on cash and investments. “Other
    (gains) losses, net” primarily includes amounts recorded in
    accordance with SFAS 133. See Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the
    Company’s hedging activities. During 2005, the Company
    recognized approximately $35 million of expense related to
    amounts excluded from the Company’s measurements of hedge
    effectiveness. Also during 2005, the Company recognized
    approximately $110 million of additional income in
    “Other (gains) losses, net,” related to the
    ineffectiveness of its hedges and the loss of hedge accounting
    for certain contracts. Of this additional income, approximately
    $77 million was unrealized,

mark-to-market

changes in the fair value of derivatives due to the
    discontinuation of hedge accounting for certain contracts that
    will settle in future periods, approximately $9 million was
    unrealized ineffectiveness associated with hedges designated for
    future periods, and $24 million was ineffectiveness and

mark-to-market

gains related to contracts that settled during 2005. For 2004,
    the Company recognized approximately $24 million of expense
    related to amounts excluded from the Company’s measurements
    of hedge effectiveness and $13 million in expense related
    to the ineffectiveness of its hedges and unrealized

mark-to-market

changes in the fair value of certain derivative contracts.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before
    taxes, increased to 37.9 percent in 2005 from
    36.5 percent in 2004. The 2004 rate was favorably impacted
    by an adjustment related to the ultimate resolution of an
    airline industry-wide issue regarding the tax treatment of
    certain aircraft engine maintenance costs, and lower state
    income taxes.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion
    in 2006 compared to $2.1 billion in 2005. For the Company,
    operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air
    transportation for Customers. The vast majority of tickets are
    purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and, in
    some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date.
    Operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring
    expenses of operating the airline. The operating cash flows in
    both years were significantly impacted by fluctuations in
    counterparty deposits associated with the Company’s fuel
    hedging program (counterparty deposits are reflected as an
    increase to Cash and a corresponding increase to Accrued
    liabilities.) There was a decrease in counterparty deposits of
    $410 million for 2006, versus an increase of
    $620 million during 2005. The decrease in these deposits
    during 2006 was due to the decline in fair value of the
    Company’s fuel derivative portfolio from December 31,
    2005 to December 31, 2006, especially during the second
    half of the year. The increase during 2005 was primarily due to
    a large increase in the fair value of the Company’s fuel
    derivative instruments, as a result of escalating energy prices
    during 2005. Cash flows from operating activities for 2006 were
    also driven by the $499 million in net income, plus noncash
    depreciation and amortization expense of $515 million. For
    further information on the Company’s hedging program and
    counterparty deposits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, and Item 7A. Qualitative and
    Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk, respectively. Cash
    generated in 2006 and in 2005 was used primarily to finance
    aircraft-related capital expenditures and to provide working
    capital.

Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2006 totaled
    $1.5 billion compared to $1.1 billion in 2005.
    Investing activities in both years primarily consisted of
    payments for new

737-700

aircraft delivered to the Company and progress payments for
    future aircraft deliveries. The Company purchased 34 new

737-700

aircraft and two previously owned

737-700

aircraft in 2006 versus the purchase of 33 new

737-700s

in
    2005. In addition, progress payments for future deliveries were
    higher in 2006 than 2005. See Note 4 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Investing activities for 2006 were also
    reduced by $117 million related to a change in the balance
    of the Company’s short-term investments, namely auction
    rate securities.

Net cash used in financing activities was $801 million in
    2006, primarily from the repurchase of $800 million of
    common stock and the repayment of $607 million



in debt. The Company repurchased a total of 49 million
    shares of outstanding common stock during 2006 as a result of
    three buyback programs authorized by the Company’s Board of
    Directors. These uses were partially offset by the issuance of
    $300 million senior unsecured 5.75% notes in December
    2006 and $260 million in proceeds from exercises of
    Employee stock options. During 2005, the Company generated a net
    $260 million from financing activities primarily from the
    issuance of $300 million senior unsecured 5.125% notes
    in February 2005, and proceeds of $132 million from
    exercises of Employee stock options. These were partially offset
    by the redemption of the Company’s $100 million senior
    unsecured 8% notes in March 2005 and the repurchase of
    $55 million of common stock. See Note 7 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the
    issuance and redemption of long-term debt.

The Company has various options available to meet its 2007
    capital and operating commitments, including cash on hand and
    short-term investments at December 31, 2006, totaling
    $1.8 billion, internally generated funds, and a
    $600 million bank revolving line of credit. In addition,
    the Company will also consider various borrowing or leasing
    options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements.
    The Company believes it has access to a wide variety of
    financing arrangements because of its excellent credit ratings,
    unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and consistent
    profitability. The Company currently has outstanding shelf
    registrations for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion in
    public debt securities and pass through certificates, which it
    may utilize for aircraft financings or other purposes in the
    future. The Company may issue a portion of these securities in
    2007, primarily to fund current fleet growth plans or to take
    advantage of certain strategic growth opportunities if they were
    to arise.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, and Contingent
    Liabilities and Commitments

Southwest has contractual obligations and commitments primarily
    with regard to future purchases of aircraft, payment of debt,
    and lease arrangements. The Company received 36,

737-700

aircraft in 2006 — 34 of which were new aircraft from
    Boeing, and two of which were pre-owned and purchased from a
    third party. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had
    exercised all remaining options for aircraft to be delivered in
    2007, and has firm orders for 37

737-700

aircraft in 2007, 30 in 2008, 18 in 2009, and ten each in

2010-2012.

The Company also had options for four

737-700

aircraft in 2008, 18 in 2009, 32 in 2010, and 30 each in 2011
    and 2012. Southwest also has an additional 54 purchase rights
    for

737-700

aircraft for the years 2008 through 2014. The Company has the
    option to substitute

737-600s

or
    -800s for the -700s. This option is applicable to aircraft
    ordered from the manufacturer and must be exercised
    18 months prior to the contractual delivery date.

The leasing of aircraft effectively provides flexibility to the
    Company as a source of financing. Although the Company is
    responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and expense
    associated with operating the aircraft, and retains the risk of
    loss for leased aircraft, it has not made any guarantees to the
    lessors regarding the residual value (or market value) of the
    aircraft at the end of the lease terms. The Company operates 93
    aircraft leased from third parties, of which 84 are operating
    leases. As prescribed by GAAP, assets and obligations under
    operating leases are not included in the Company’s
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Disclosure of the contractual
    obligations associated with the Company’s leased aircraft
    are included below as well as in Note 8 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

The Company is required to provide standby letters of credit to
    support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. Although the letters of credit are an off-balance
    sheet item, the majority of obligations to which they relate are
    reflected as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
    Outstanding letters of credit totaled $211 million at
    December 31, 2006.

There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit

    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the
    Company’s revolving credit facility.

In January 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the
    Company’s common stock, utilizing present and anticipated
    proceeds from the exercise of Employee stock options.
    Repurchases were made in accordance with applicable securities
    laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to
    time, depending on market conditions. This program was completed
    during first quarter 2005, resulting in the total repurchase of
    approximately 20.9 million of the Company’s common
    shares.

In 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized three
    separate programs for the repurchase of up to a total of
    $1.0 billion of the Company’s Common Stock —
    $300 million authorized in January 2006, $300 million
    authorized in May 2006, and $400 million authorized in
    November 2006. Repurchases have been made in accordance with
    applicable securities laws in the open market or in private
    transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions.
    Through December 31, 2006, these programs resulted in the
    repurchase of a total of 49.1 million shares for
    $800 million.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been
    prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP (GAAP). The
    Company’s significant accounting policies are described in
    Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
    requires the Company’s management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes. The
    Company’s estimates and assumptions are based on historical
    experience and changes in the business environment. However,
    actual results may differ from estimates under different
    conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies
    and estimates are defined as those that are both most important
    to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and
    results and require management’s most subjective judgments.
    The Company’s most critical accounting policies and
    estimates are described below.

Revenue
    Recognition

As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially
    deferred as “Air traffic liability.” Passenger revenue
    is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the
    service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place).
    “Air traffic liability” represents tickets sold for
    future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges
    of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in “Air
    traffic liability” fluctuates throughout the year based on
    seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. The
    Company’s “Air traffic liability” balance at
    December 31, 2006 was $799 million, compared to
    $649 million as of December 31, 2005.



Estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded,
    exchanged, or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and
    judgment. The majority of the Company’s tickets sold are
    nonrefundable, which is the primary source of forfeited tickets.
    According to the Company’s “Contract of
    Carriage”, tickets (whether refundable or nonrefundable)
    that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for
    another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or can be
    refunded (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of
    tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused. Fully refundable
    tickets are rarely forfeited. “Air traffic liability”
    includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and
    exchanges, net of forfeitures, for all unused tickets once the
    flight date has passed. These estimates are based on historical
    experience over many years. The Company and members of the
    airline industry have consistently applied this accounting
    method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of
    travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the
    air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on
    subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy
    of the Company’s estimates with respect to forfeited
    tickets. Holding other factors constant, a ten-percent change in
    the Company’s estimate of the amount of refunded,
    exchanged, or forfeited tickets for 2006 would have resulted in
    a $16 million, or .2%, change in Passenger revenues
    recognized for that period.

Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale
    activity or historical Customer travel patterns, as noted, can
    result in actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeited tickets
    differing significantly from estimates. The Company evaluates
    its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts. If
    actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeiture experience results in
    an amount outside of this range, estimates and assumptions are
    reviewed and adjustments to “Air traffic liability”
    and to “Passenger revenue” are recorded, as necessary.
    Additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and
    exchanges include, but may not be limited to, the Company’s
    refund and exchange policy, the mix of refundable and
    nonrefundable fares, and promotional fare activity. The
    Company’s estimation techniques have been consistently
    applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates,
    actual refund, exchange, and forfeiture activity may vary from
    estimated amounts. No material adjustments were recorded for
    years 2004, 2005, or 2006.

The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different
    estimates for future refunds, exchanges, and forfeited tickets
    would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or
    conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other
    data available at the time estimates were made.

Accounting
    for Long-Lived Assets

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately
    $13.9 billion (at cost) of long-lived assets, including
    $11.8 billion (at cost) in flight equipment and related
    assets. Flight equipment primarily relates to the 397 Boeing 737
    aircraft in the Company’s fleet at December 31, 2006,
    which are either owned or on capital lease. The remaining 84
    Boeing 737 aircraft in the Company’s fleet at
    December 31, 2006, are on operating lease. In accounting
    for long-lived assets, the Company must make estimates about the
    expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual
    values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on
    the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate.

The following table shows a breakdown of the Company’s
    long-lived asset groups along with information about estimated
    useful lives and residual values of these groups:

Ground property and equipment

5 to 30 years

0%-10%

0%

In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its
    aircraft, the Company primarily has relied upon actual
    experience with the same or similar aircraft types and
    recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of the
    Company’s aircraft. Aircraft estimated useful lives are
    based on the number of “cycles” flown (one take-off
    and landing). The Company has made a conversion of cycles into
    years based on both its historical and anticipated future
    utilization of the aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these
    estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes
    to the Company’s maintenance program, changes in
    utilization of the aircraft (actual cycles during a given period
    of time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and
    changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or
    similar types. The Company evaluates its estimates and
    assumptions each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts
    these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments
    are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation
    and amortization expense, as required by GAAP.



When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets
    for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment
    may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in
    the market value of the long-lived asset(s), a significant
    change in the long-lived asset’s physical condition, and
    operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the
    long-lived asset. While the airline industry as a whole has
    experienced many of these indicators, Southwest has continued to
    operate all of its aircraft, generate positive cash flow, and
    produce profits. Consequently, the Company has not identified
    any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The
    Company will continue to monitor its long-lived assets and the
    airline operating environment.

The Company believes it unlikely that materially different
    estimates for expected lives, expected residual values, and
    impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other
    reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual
    historical experience and other data available at the time
    estimates were made.

Financial
    Derivative Instruments

The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily
    to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices, and
    accounts for them under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended
    (SFAS 133). See “Qualitative and Quantitative
    Disclosures about Market Risk” for more information on
    these risk management activities and see Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on
    SFAS 133, the Company’s fuel hedging program, and
    financial derivative instruments.

SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be marked to market
    (fair value) and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At
    December 31, 2006, the Company was a party to over 480
    financial derivative instruments, related to its fuel hedging
    program, for year 2007 and beyond. The fair value of the
    Company’s fuel hedging financial derivative instruments
    recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    December 31, 2006, was $999 million, compared to
    $1.7 billion at December 31, 2005. The large decrease
    in fair value primarily was due to the decrease in energy prices
    in the second half of 2006, as well as the expiration of
    approximately $675 million in fuel derivative instruments
    that related to 2006, net of new derivative instruments the
    Company added for future years. Changes in the fair values of
    these instruments can vary dramatically, as was evident during
    both 2005 and 2006, based on changes in the underlying commodity
    prices. Market price changes can be driven by factors such as
    supply and demand, inventory levels, weather events, refinery
    capacity, political agendas, and general economic conditions,
    among other items. The financial derivative instruments utilized
    by the Company primarily are a combination of collars, purchased
    call options, and fixed price swap agreements. The Company does
    not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading
    purposes.

The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with
    third party institutions in

“over-the-counter”

markets. Since the majority of the Company’s financial
    derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the
    Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of
    instrument, the values are determined by the use of present
    value methods or standard option value models with assumptions
    about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying
    markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for
    jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet
    fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging
    instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required
    by SFAS 133. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through
    the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as
    crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline) and adjusted
    based on historical variations to those like commodities.

Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet
    fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the
    financial derivative instruments settle, and the time that jet
    fuel is purchased and consumed, respectively. However, once
    settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and
    the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and
    prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements.
    In recent years, because of increased volatility in energy
    markets, the Company’s estimates have materially differed
    from actual results, resulting in increased volatility in the
    Company’s periodic financial results.

Estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments
    and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in
    their values from period to period and thus determine how they
    are accounted for under SFAS 133. To the extent that the
    change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative
    instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the
    associated jet fuel to be purchased, both on a cumulative and a

period-to-period

basis, ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result, as defined
    by SFAS 133. This could result in the immediate recording
    of noncash charges or income, representing the change in the
    fair value of the derivative, even though the derivative
    instrument may not expire until a future period.



Likewise, if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge
    accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivative
    instrument is recorded every period to “Other gains and
    losses” in the income statement in the period of the change.

Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative
    positions based in other crude oil related commodities,
    especially given the magnitude of the current fair market value
    of the Company’s fuel derivatives and the recent volatility
    in the prices of refined products. Due to the volatility in
    markets for crude oil and related products, the Company is
    unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period,
    including the loss of hedge accounting, which could be
    determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the
    aggregate. This may result, and has resulted, in increased
    volatility in the Company’s financial statements. The
    significant increase in the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and
    unrealized gains and losses on the change in value of derivative
    contracts settling in future periods recorded during recent
    periods has been due to a number of factors. These factors
    include: the significant fluctuation in energy prices, the
    number of derivative positions the Company holds, significant
    weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the
    production of refined products, and the volatility of the
    different types of products the Company uses for protection. The
    number of instances in which the Company has discontinued hedge
    accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined
    products, such as unleaded gasoline, has increased recently,
    primarily due to these reasons. In these cases, the Company has
    determined that the hedges will not regain effectiveness in the
    time period remaining until settlement and therefore must
    discontinue special hedge accounting, as defined by
    SFAS 133. When this happens, any changes in fair value of
    the derivative instruments are marked to market through earnings
    in the period of change. As the fair value of the Company’s
    hedge positions increases in amount, there is a higher degree of
    probability that there will be continued variability recorded in
    the income statement and that the amount of hedge
    ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in
    future periods will be material. This is primarily due to the
    fact that small differences in the correlation of crude oil
    related products are leveraged over large dollar volumes.

SFAS 133 is a complex accounting standard with stringent
    requirements, including the documentation of a Company hedging
    strategy, statistical analysis to qualify a commodity for hedge
    accounting both on a historical and a prospective basis, and
    strict contemporaneous documentation that is required at the
    time each hedge is designated by the Company. As required by
    SFAS 133, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each of
    its individual hedges on a quarterly basis. The Company also
    examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a
    quarterly basis utilizing statistical analysis. This analysis
    involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses
    that compare changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the
    prices of the commodities used for hedging purposes.

The Company continually looks for better and more accurate
    methodologies in forecasting future cash flows relating to its
    jet fuel hedging program. These estimates are used in the
    measurement of effectiveness for the Company’s fuel hedges,
    as required by SFAS 133. During first quarter 2006, the
    Company did revise its method for forecasting future cash flows.
    Previously, the Company had estimated future cash flows using
    actual market forward prices of like commodities and adjusting
    for historical differences from the Company’s actual jet
    fuel purchase prices. The Company’s new methodology
    utilizes a statistical-based regression equation with data from
    market forward prices of like commodities. This equation is then
    adjusted for certain items, such as transportation costs, that
    are stated in the Company’s fuel purchasing contracts with
    its vendors. This change to the Company’s methodology for
    estimating future cash flows (i.e., jet fuel prices) was applied
    prospectively, in accordance with the Company’s
    interpretation of SFAS 133. The Company believes that this
    change for estimating future cash flows will result in more
    effective hedges over the long-term.

The Company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in
    the form of interest rate swap agreements. The primary objective
    for the Company’s use of interest rate hedges is to reduce
    the volatility of net interest income by better matching the
    repricing of its assets and liabilities. During 2003, the
    Company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to
    its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012,
    and $375 million 5.496%

Class A-2

pass-through certificates due 2006. The interest rate swap
    associated with the $375 million 5.496%

Class A-2

pass-through certificates expired on the date the certificates
    were repaid in fourth quarter 2006. The floating rate paid under
    the swap associated with the $385 million 6.5% senior
    unsecured notes due 2012 sets in arrears. The Company pays the
    London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin every six
    months and receives 6.5% every six months on a notional amount
    of $385 million until 2012. The average floating rate paid
    under this agreement during 2006 is estimated to be
    7.63 percent based on actual and forward rates at
    December 31, 2006.



The Company is also party to an interest rate swap agreement
    relating to its $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured
    notes due 2014, in which the floating rate is set at the
    beginning of each six month period. Under this agreement, the
    Company pays LIBOR plus a margin every six months and receives
    5.25% every six months on a notional amount of $350 million
    until 2014. The average floating rate paid under this agreement
    during 2006 was 5.69 percent.

The Company’s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair
    value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. In addition, these
    interest rate swap agreements qualify for the
    “shortcut” method of accounting for hedges, as defined
    by SFAS 133. Under the “shortcut” method, the
    hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective, and, thus, there
    is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings. The fair value
    of the interest rate swap agreements, which are adjusted
    regularly, are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as
    necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value
    of the long-term debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap
    agreements, excluding accrued interest, at December 31,
    2006, was a liability of approximately $30 million. The
    comparable fair value of these same agreements at
    December 31, 2005, was a liability of $31 million. The
    long-term portion of these amounts are recorded in “Other
    deferred liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for
    each respective year. In accordance with fair value hedging, the
    offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value
    of long-term debt. See Note 10 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different
    estimates for the fair value of financial derivative
    instruments, and forward jet fuel prices, would be made or
    reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions
    suggested by actual historical experience and other data
    available at the time estimates were made.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company has share-based compensation plans covering the
    majority of its Employee groups, including plans adopted via
    collective bargaining, a plan covering the Company’s Board
    of Directors, and plans related to employment contracts with one
    Executive Officer of the Company. Prior to January 1, 2006,
    the Company accounted for stock-based compensation utilizing the
    intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25),
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related
    Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense was
    recognized for fixed option plans because the exercise prices of
    Employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market prices of
    the underlying stock on the dates of grant. However, prior to
    adoption of SFAS 123R, share-based compensation had been
    included in pro forma disclosures in the financial statement
    footnotes for periods prior to 2006.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment” using the modified retrospective
    transition method. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates
    the use of APB 25 and the intrinsic value method of
    accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of
    Employee services received in exchange for awards of equity
    instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards,
    in the financial statements.

Under the modified retrospective method, compensation cost is
    recognized in the financial statements beginning with the
    effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for
    all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on
    the requirements of SFAS 123 for all unvested awards
    granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R. In
    addition, results for prior periods have been retroactively
    adjusted utilizing the pro forma disclosures in those prior
    financial statements, except as noted. As part of this revision,
    the Company recorded cumulative share-based compensation expense
    of $409 million for the period

1995-2005,

resulting in a reduction to Retained earnings in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,
    2005. This adjustment, along with the creation of a net Deferred
    income tax asset in the amount of $130 million, resulted in
    an offsetting increase to Capital in excess of par value in the
    amount of $539 million in the accompanying Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. The Deferred tax
    asset represents the portion of the cumulative expense related
    to stock options that will result in a future tax deduction.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on
    the date of grant utilizing a modified Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
    developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term
    traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
    transferable. However, certain assumptions used in the
    Black-Scholes model, such as expected term, can be adjusted to
    incorporate the unique characteristics of the Company’s
    stock option awards. Option valuation models require the input
    of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock
    price volatility and expected term. For 2005 and 2006, the
    Company has relied on observations of both historical volatility
    trends, implied future volatility



observations as determined by independent third parties, and
    implied volatility from traded options on the Company’s
    stock. For both 2006 and 2005 stock option grants, the Company
    utilized expected volatility based on the expected life of the
    option, but within a range of 25% to 27%. Prior to 2005, the
    Company relied exclusively on historical volatility as an input
    for determining the estimated fair value of stock options. In
    determining the expected term of the option grants, the Company
    has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar
    characteristics, the actual vesting schedule of the grant, and
    assessed the expected risk tolerance of different optionee
    groups.

Other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the
    Black-Scholes model are the expected risk-free interest rate and
    expected dividend yield of the Company’s stock. The
    risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury
    zero-coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the
    option on the date of grant. The expected dividend yield of the
    Company’s common stock over the expected term of the option
    on the date of grant was estimated based on the Company’s
    current dividend yield, and adjusted for anticipated future
    changes.

Vesting terms for the Company’s stock option plans differ
    based on the type of grant made and the group to which the
    options are granted. For grants made to Employees under
    collective bargaining plans, vesting has ranged in length from
    immediate vesting to vesting periods in accordance with the
    period covered by the respective collective bargaining
    agreement. For “Other Employee Plans”, options vest
    and become fully exercisable over three, five, or ten years of
    continued employment, depending upon the grant type. For grants
    in any of the Company’s plans that are subject to graded
    vesting over a service period, the Company recognizes expense on
    a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
    entire award. None of the Company’s grants include
    performance-based or market-based vesting conditions, as defined.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company has $74 million
    in remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to past
    grants of stock options, which is expected to be recognized over
    a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. The total
    recognition period for the remaining unrecognized compensation
    cost is approximately ten years; however, the majority of this
    cost will be recognized over the next two years, in accordance
    with vesting provisions. Over 80 percent of net
    unrecognized amount at December 31, 2006, related to
    options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R on
    January 1, 2006. In addition, the vast majority of the
    $80 million in share-based compensation expense reflected
    in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, was related to options granted prior to
    the adoption of SFAS 123R. Based on Employee stock options
    expected to vest during 2007, the number of options eligible to
    be granted in future periods and the Company’s expectation
    of future grants, the Company expects the expense related to
    share-based compensation to decrease significantly during 2007
    compared to 2006 expense.

The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different
    estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value
    of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions
    suggested by actual historical experience and other data
    available at the time estimates were made.

Item 7A.

Qualitative
    and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt
    obligations and interest rate swaps, and has commodity price
    risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet. The
    Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but
    seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented
    hedging strategy. Southwest has market sensitive instruments in
    the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative
    instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price
    increases. The Company also operates 93 aircraft under operating
    and capital leases. However, leases are not considered market
    sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included
    in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments
    related to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase
    or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading
    purposes. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for information on the Company’s accounting for
    its hedging program and for further details on the
    Company’s financial derivative instruments.

Fuel
    Hedging

The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments, on both a
    short-term and a long-term basis, as a form of insurance against
    significant increases in fuel prices. The Company believes there
    is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of
    such fuel price increases. The Company expects to consume
    approximately 1.5 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2007.
    Based on this usage, a change in jet fuel prices of just one
    cent per gallon would impact the Company’s “Fuel and
    oil expense” by approximately $15 million per year,
    excluding any impact of the Company’s derivative
    instruments.

The fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments
    related to the Company’s jet fuel market price risk at
    December 31, 2006, were net assets of $999 million.
    The current portion of these financial derivative instruments,
    or $369 million, is classified as “Fuel derivative
    contracts” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The long-term
    portion of these financial derivative instruments, or
    $630 million, is included in “Other assets.” The
    fair values of the derivative instruments, depending on the type
    of instrument, were determined by use of present value methods
    or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity
    prices based on those observed in underlying markets. An
    immediate ten-percent increase or decrease in underlying
    fuel-related commodity prices from the December 31, 2006,
    prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the
    commodity derivative instruments in place by up to
    $480 million. Changes in the related commodity derivative
    instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this
    amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well
    as related income tax effects. This sensitivity analysis uses
    industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant
    at December 31, 2006, levels, except underlying futures
    prices.

Outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the Company
    to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
    counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not
    expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their
    obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial
    instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a
    positive fair value at the reporting date. To manage credit
    risk, the Company selects and will periodically review
    counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a
    single counterparty, and monitors the market position of the
    program and its relative market position with each counterparty.
    At December 31, 2006, the Company had agreements with eight
    counterparties containing early termination rights

and/or

bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if
    market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or
    credit ratings fall below certain levels. At December 31,
    2006, the Company held $540 million in cash collateral
    deposits under these bilateral collateral provisions. These
    collateral deposits serve to decrease, but not totally
    eliminate, the credit risk associated with the Company’s
    hedging program. The deposits are included in “Accrued
    liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See also
    Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial
    Market Risk

The vast majority of the Company’s assets are aircraft,
    which are long-lived. The Company’s strategy is to maintain
    a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and
    profitably. While the Company uses financial leverage, it has
    maintained a strong balance sheet and an “A” credit
    rating on its senior unsecured fixed-rate debt with
    Standard & Poor’s and Fitch ratings agencies, and
    a “Baa1” credit rating with Moody’s rating
    agency. The Company’s 1999 and 2004 French Credit
    Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but
    do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are
    floating-rate debt. In addition, as disclosed in Note 10 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has



converted certain of its long-term debt to floating rate debt by
    entering into interest rate swap agreements. This includes the
    Company’s $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured
    notes due 2012 and the $350 million 5.25% senior
    unsecured notes due 2014. Although there is interest rate risk
    associated with these floating rate borrowings, the risk for the
    1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements is somewhat mitigated by
    the fact that the Company may prepay this debt under certain
    conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for more information on the material terms of the
    Company’s short-term and long-term debt.

Excluding the $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured
    notes, and the $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured
    notes that were converted to a floating rate as previously
    noted, the Company had outstanding senior unsecured notes
    totaling $800 million at December 31, 2006. These
    senior unsecured notes currently have a weighted-average
    maturity of 10.2 years at fixed rates averaging
    5.98 percent at December 31, 2006, which is comparable
    to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over
    the last ten years. The carrying value of the Company’s
    floating rate debt totaled $843 million, and this debt had
    a weighted-average maturity of 7.0 years at floating rates
    averaging 6.74 percent for the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2006. In total, the Company’s fixed rate
    debt and floating rate debt represented 7.4 percent and
    7.8 percent, respectively, of total noncurrent assets at
    December 31, 2006.

The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest
    rates due to the short-term nature of its invested cash, which
    totaled $1.4 billion, and short-term investments, which
    totaled $369 million, at December 31, 2006. The
    Company invests available cash in certificates of deposit,
    highly rated money market instruments, investment grade
    commercial paper, auction rate securities, and other highly
    rated financial instruments. Because of the short-term nature of
    these investments, the returns earned parallel closely with
    short-term floating interest rates. The Company has not
    undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market
    risk and is not a party to any other material market interest
    rate risk management activities.

A hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of
    December 31, 2006, would not have a material affect on the
    fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt instruments.
    See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information on the fair value of the Company’s
    financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could,
    however, have a corresponding effect on the Company’s
    earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt,
    invested cash, and short-term investments because of the
    floating-rate nature of these items. Assuming floating market
    rates in effect as of December 31, 2006, were held constant
    throughout a

12-month

period, a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would
    correspondingly change the Company’s net earnings and cash
    flows associated with these items by less than $3 million.
    Utilizing these assumptions and considering the Company’s
    cash balance, short-term investments, and floating-rate debt
    outstanding at December 31, 2006, an increase in rates
    would have a net positive effect on the Company’s earnings
    and cash flows, while a decrease in rates would have a net
    negative effect on the Company’s earnings and cash flows.
    However, a ten percent change in market rates would not impact
    the Company’s earnings or cash flow associated with the
    Company’s publicly traded fixed-rate debt.

The Company is also subject to various financial covenants
    included in its credit card transaction processing agreement,
    the revolving credit facility, and outstanding debt agreements.
    Covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings. For
    the revolving credit facility, the Company shall also maintain,
    at all times, a Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of
    not less than 1.25 to 1.0. The Company met or exceeded the
    minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of
    December 31, 2006. However, if conditions change and the
    Company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the
    agreements, it could reduce the availability of cash under the
    agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact
    as written.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2006

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
    of Presentation

Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest) is a major domestic airline
    that provides

point-to-point,

low-fare service. The Consolidated Financial Statements include
    the accounts of Southwest and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the
    Company). All significant intercompany balances and transactions
    have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from these estimates.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash in excess of that necessary for operating requirements is
    invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing
    investments. Investments with maturities of three months or less
    are classified as cash and cash equivalents, which primarily
    consist of certificates of deposit, money market funds, and
    investment grade commercial paper issued by major corporations
    and financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents are stated
    at cost, which approximates market value.

Short-Term
    Investments

Short-term investments consist of auction rate securities with
    auction reset periods of less than 12 months. These
    investments are classified as

available-for-sale

securities and are stated at fair value. At each reset period,
    the Company accounts for the transaction as “Proceeds from
    sales of short-term investments” for the security
    relinquished, and a “purchase of short-term
    investment” for the security purchased, in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Prior year amounts have
    been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation.
    Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are recognized in
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized gains and
    losses on specific investments, which totaled $17 million
    in 2006, $4 million in 2005, and $5 million in 2004,
    are reflected in “Interest income” in the accompanying
    Consolidated Income Statement.

Inventories

Inventories primarily consist of flight equipment expendable
    parts, materials, aircraft fuel, and supplies. All of these
    items are carried at average cost. These items are generally
    charged to expense when issued for use.

Property
    and Equipment

Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method to
    estimated residual values over periods generally ranging from 23
    to 25 years for flight equipment and 5 to 30 years for
    ground property and equipment once the asset is placed in
    service. Residual values estimated for aircraft are
    15 percent and for ground property and equipment range from
    zero to 10 percent. Property under capital leases and
    related obligations are recorded at an amount equal to the
    present value of future minimum lease payments computed on the
    basis of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate or, when
    known, the interest rate implicit in the lease. Amortization of
    property under capital leases is on a straight-line basis over
    the lease term and is included in depreciation expense.

In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its
    aircraft, the Company primarily has relied upon actual
    experience with the same or similar aircraft types and
    recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of the
    Company’s aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these
    estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes
    to the Company’s maintenance program, modifications or
    improvements to the aircraft, changes in utilization of the
    aircraft (actual flight hours or cycles during a given period of
    time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, changing
    market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar
    types, etc. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions
    each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts these
    estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are
    accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and
    amortization expense, as required by GAAP.

When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets
    used in operations for impairment. Impairment losses would be
    recorded when events and circumstances indicate that an asset
    might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows to be
    generated by that asset are less than the carrying amounts of
    the asset. Factors that would indicate potential impairment
    include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the
    market value of the long-lived asset(s), a significant change in
    the long-lived asset’s physical condition, operating or
    cash flow losses



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

associated with the use of the long-lived asset, etc. Southwest
    has continued to operate all of its aircraft and continues to
    experience positive cash flow.

Aircraft
    and Engine Maintenance

The cost of scheduled inspections and repairs and routine
    maintenance costs for all aircraft and engines are charged to
    maintenance expense as incurred. Modifications that
    significantly enhance the operating performance or extend the
    useful lives of aircraft or engines are capitalized and
    amortized over the remaining life of the asset.

Intangible
    Assets

Intangible assets primarily consist of leasehold rights to
    airport owned gates. These assets are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the lease,
    approximately 20 years. The accumulated amortization
    related to the Company’s intangible assets at
    December 31, 2006, and 2005, was $5 million and
    $2 million, respectively. The Company periodically assesses
    its intangible assets for impairment in accordance with
    SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

;
    however, no impairments have been noted.

Revenue
    Recognition

Tickets sold are initially deferred as “Air traffic
    liability”. Passenger revenue is recognized when
    transportation is provided. “Air traffic liability”
    primarily represents tickets sold for future travel dates and
    estimated refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel
    dates. The majority of the Company’s tickets sold are
    nonrefundable. Tickets that are sold but not flown on the travel
    date (whether refundable or nonrefundable) can be reused for
    another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or refunded
    (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or
    partial tickets) expire unused. The Company estimates the amount
    of future refunds and exchanges, net of forfeitures, for all
    unused tickets once the flight date has passed. These estimates
    are based on historical experience over many years. The Company
    and members of the airline industry have consistently applied
    this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited
    tickets at the date travel is provided. Estimated future refunds
    and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are
    constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange
    activity to validate the accuracy of the Company’s revenue
    recognition method with respect to forfeited tickets.

Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale
    activity or historical Customer travel patterns can result in
    actual refunds, exchanges or forfeited tickets differing
    significantly from estimates; however, these differences have
    historically not been material. Additional factors that may
    affect estimated refunds, exchanges, and forfeitures include,
    but may not be limited to, the Company’s refund and
    exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares,
    and fare sale activity. The Company’s estimation techniques
    have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as
    with any estimates, actual refund and exchange activity may vary
    from estimated amounts.

Frequent
    Flyer Program

The Company accrues the estimated incremental cost of providing
    free travel for awards earned under its Rapid Rewards frequent
    flyer program. The estimated incremental cost includes direct
    passenger costs such as fuel, food, and other operational costs,
    but does not include any contribution to overhead or profit. The
    Company also sells frequent flyer credits and related services
    to companies participating in its Rapid Rewards frequent flyer
    program. Funds received from the sale of flight segment credits
    are accounted for under the residual value method. The portion
    of those funds associated with future travel are deferred and
    recognized as “Passenger revenue” when the ultimate
    free travel awards are flown or the credits expire unused. The
    portion of the funds not associated with future travel are
    recognized in “Other revenue” in the period earned.

Advertising

The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
    Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005, and 2004 was $182 million, $173 million, and
    $158 million, respectively.

Share-Based
    Employee Compensation

The Company has stock-based compensation plans covering the
    majority of its Employee groups, including a plan covering the
    Company’s Board of Directors and plans related to
    employment contracts with one Executive Officer of the Company.
    The Company accounts for stock-based compensation utilizing the
    fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment”. See Note 13.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Financial
    Derivative Instruments

The Company accounts for financial derivative instruments
    utilizing Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 133 (SFAS 133), “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended. The
    Company utilizes various derivative instruments, including crude
    oil, unleaded gasoline, and heating oil-based derivatives, to
    attempt to reduce the risk of its exposure to jet fuel price
    increases. These instruments primarily consist of purchased call
    options, collar structures, and fixed-price swap agreements, and
    upon proper qualification are accounted for as cash-flow hedges,
    as defined by SFAS 133. The Company has also entered into
    interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of its
    fixed-rate debt to floating rates. These interest rate hedges
    are accounted for as fair value hedges, as defined by
    SFAS 133.

Since the majority of the Company’s financial derivative
    instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the Company
    estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of
    instrument, the values are determined by the use of present
    value methods or standard option value models with assumptions
    about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying
    markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for
    jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet
    fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging
    instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required
    by SFAS 133. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through
    utilization of a statistical-based regression equation with data
    from market forward prices of like commodities. This equation is
    then adjusted for certain items, such as transportation costs,
    that are stated in the Company’s fuel purchasing contracts
    with its vendors. See Note 10 for further information on
    SFAS 133 and financial derivative instruments.

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for deferred income taxes utilizing
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109
    (SFAS 109), “Accounting for Income Taxes”, as
    amended. SFAS 109 requires an asset and liability method,
    whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based
    on the tax effects of temporary differences between the
    financial statements and the tax bases of assets and
    liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. When
    appropriate, in accordance with SFAS 109, the Company
    evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred
    tax assets.

Accounting
    Changes and Recent Accounting Developments

Aircraft
    and Engine Maintenance

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company changed its method
    of accounting for scheduled airframe inspection and repairs for

737-300

and

737-500

aircraft from the deferral method to the direct expense method.
    The Company recorded the change in accounting in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”
    (SFAS 154), which was effective for calendar year companies
    on January 1, 2006. SFAS 154 requires that all
    elective accounting changes be made on a retrospective basis. As
    such, the accompanying financial statements and footnotes were
    adjusted in first quarter 2006 to apply the direct expense
    method retrospectively to all prior periods.

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, Maintenance
    materials and repairs expense was increased by $15 million
    in each year, resulting in a reduction in net income of
    $9 million for each year. Net income per share, basic and
    diluted, was each reduced by $.01 per share for both 2004
    and 2005. The impact of adopting the direct expense method on
    net income for 2006 was not material.

Share-Based
    Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment” using the modified retrospective
    transition method. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates
    the use of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
    (APB 25), “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” and related Interpretations, and the intrinsic
    value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize
    the cost of Employee services received in exchange for awards of
    equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those
    awards, in the financial statements. Under the modified
    retrospective transition method, all prior periods have been
    retrospectively adjusted to conform to the requirements of
    SFAS 123R.

As part of the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company recorded
    cumulative share-based compensation expense, net of taxes, of
    $409 million for the period

1995-2005,

resulting in a reduction to Retained earnings in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. This
    adjustment, along with the creation of a net Deferred income tax
    asset in the amount of $130 million, resulted in an
    offsetting increase to Capital in excess of

Postretirement
    Benefits

In September 2006, the FASB issued statement No. 158,
    “Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pensions and
    Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106, and 123R,” (SFAS 158). On
    December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and
    disclosure provisions of Statement 158. Statement 158
    requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans (collectively, “postretirement
    benefit plans”) to recognize the funded status of their
    postretirement benefit plans in the statement of financial
    position, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit
    obligations as of the date of the fiscal year-end statement of
    financial position, and provide additional disclosures. The
    effect of adopting Statement 158 on the Company’s
    financial

condition at December 31, 2006 has been included in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements.
    Statement 158 did not have an effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial condition at December 31, 2005 or
    2004. See Note 14 for further discussion.

Recent
    Accounting Developments

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48), which clarifies
    the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions,
    as defined. FIN 48 seeks to reduce the diversity in
    practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and
    measurement related to accounting for income taxes. This
    interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect the
    interpretation will have a material impact on its results from
    operations or financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”

,

(SFAS 157).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with
    earlier application encouraged. Any amounts recognized upon
    adoption as a cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to
    the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of
    adoption. The Company has not yet determined the impact of this
    Statement on its financial condition and results of operations.

Acquisition
    of Certain Assets

In fourth quarter 2004, Southwest was selected as the winning
    bidder at a bankruptcy-court approved auction for certain ATA
    Airlines, Inc. (ATA) assets. As part of the transaction, which
    was approved in December 2004, Southwest agreed to pay
    $40 million for certain ATA assets, consisting of the
    leasehold rights to six of ATA’s leased Chicago Midway
    Airport gates and the rights to a leased aircraft maintenance
    hangar at Chicago Midway Airport. In addition, Southwest
    provided ATA with $40 million in

debtor-in-possession

financing while ATA remained in bankruptcy, and also guaranteed
    the repayment of an ATA construction loan to the City of Chicago
    for $7 million. As part of this original transaction,
    Southwest committed, upon ATA’s emergence from bankruptcy,
    to convert the

debtor-in-possession

financing to a term loan, payable over five years, and to invest
    $30 million cash in ATA convertible preferred stock.

During fourth quarter 2005, ATA entered into an agreement in
    which an investor, MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities
    Partners II, would provide financing to enable ATA to
    emerge from bankruptcy. As part of this transaction, Southwest
    entered into an agreement with ATA to acquire the leasehold
    rights to four additional leased gates at Chicago Midway Airport
    in exchange for a $20 million reduction in the
    Company’s

debtor-in-possession

loan. Upon ATA’s emergence from bankruptcy, which took
    place on February 28, 2006, ATA repaid the remaining
    $20 million balance of the

debtor-in-possession

financing to the Company, and provided a letter of credit to
    support Southwest’s obligation under the construction loan
    to the City of Chicago. In addition, Southwest was relieved of
    its commitment to purchase ATA convertible preferred stock.

Southwest and ATA agreed on a code share arrangement, which was
    approved by the Department of Transportation in January 2005.
    Under the agreement, which has since been expanded, each carrier
    can exchange passengers on certain designated flights. Sales of
    the code share flights began in January 2005, with travel dates
    beginning in February 2005. As part of the December 2005
    agreement with ATA, Southwest has enhanced its codeshare
    arrangement with ATA to include additional flights and
    destinations, among other items. In addition, the Company and
    ATA have instituted enhancements to Southwest’s Rapid
    Rewards frequent flyer program to provide new award destinations
    via ATA.

Commitments

The Company’s contractual purchase commitments primarily
    consist of scheduled aircraft acquisitions from Boeing. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company had contractual purchase
    commitments with Boeing for 37

737-700

aircraft deliveries in 2007, 30 scheduled for delivery in 2008,
    18 in 2009, and ten each in

2010-2012.

In addition, the Company has options and purchase rights for an
    additional 168

737-700s

that it may acquire during

2008-2014.

The Company has the option, which must be exercised
    18 months prior to the contractual delivery date, to
    substitute

737-600s

or

737-800s

for
    the

737-700s.

As
    of December 31, 2006, aggregate funding needed for firm
    commitments is approximately $3.1 billion, subject to
    adjustments for inflation, due as follows: $1.0 billion in
    2007, $758 million in 2008, $467 million

Revolving
    Credit Facility

The Company has a revolving credit facility under which it can
    borrow up to $600 million from a group of banks. The
    facility expires in August 2010 and is unsecured. At the
    Company’s option, interest on the facility can be
    calculated on one of several different bases. For most
    borrowings, Southwest would anticipate choosing a floating rate
    based upon LIBOR. If the facility had been fully drawn at
    December 31, 2006, the spread over LIBOR would be 62.5
    basis points given Southwest’s credit rating at that date.
    The facility also contains a financial covenant requiring a
    minimum coverage ratio of adjusted pretax income to fixed
    obligations, as defined. As of December 31, 2006, the
    Company is in compliance with this covenant, and there are no
    outstanding amounts borrowed under this facility.

During December 2006, the Company issued $300 million
    senior unsecured Notes due 2016. The notes bear interest at
    5.75 percent, payable semi-annually in arrears, with the
    first payment due on June 15, 2007. Southwest used the net
    proceeds from the issuance of the

    STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

notes, approximately $297 million, for general corporate
    purposes.

During 2006, the Company redeemed the balance of its
    $529 million face value Pass Through Certificates;
    $65 million for the

Class A-1

certificates was redeemed in May 2006 and $464 million for
    the

Class A-2

and Class B certificates was redeemed in November 2006. The
    Company’s interest rate swap agreement associated with the

Class A-2

certificates, which was reflected as a reduction in the value of
    that debt in the amount of $6 million at December 31,
    2005, expired concurrent with the redemption of those
    certificates in November 2006.

During 2006, the Company redeemed two separate $29 million
    non-interest bearing notes on their maturity dates of
    February 24, 2006 and April 28, 2006, respectively.

During February 2005, the Company issued $300 million
    senior unsecured Notes due 2017. The notes bear interest at
    5.125 percent, payable semi-annually in arrears, with the
    first payment made on September 1, 2005. Southwest used the
    net proceeds from the issuance of the notes, approximately
    $296 million, for general corporate purposes.

In fourth quarter 2004, the Company entered into four identical

13-year

floating-rate financing arrangements, whereby it borrowed a
    total of $112 million from French banking partnerships.
    Although the interest on the borrowings are at floating rates,
    the Company estimates that, considering the full effect of the
    “net present value benefits” included in the
    transactions, the effective economic yield over the

13-year

term
    of the loans will be approximately LIBOR minus 45 basis
    points. Principal and interest are payable semi-annually on
    June 30 and December 31 for each of the loans, and the
    Company may terminate the arrangements in any year on either of
    those dates, with certain conditions. The Company pledged four
    aircraft as collateral for the transactions.

In September 2004, the Company issued $350 million senior
    unsecured Notes due 2014. The notes bear interest at
    5.25 percent, payable semi-annually in arrears, on
    April 1 and October 1. Concurrently, the Company
    entered into an interest-rate swap agreement to convert this
    fixed-rate debt to a floating rate. See Note 10 for more
    information on the interest-rate swap agreement. Southwest used
    the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes, approximately
    $346 million, for general corporate purposes.

On March 1, 2002, the Company issued $385 million
    senior unsecured Notes due March 1, 2012. The notes bear
    interest at 6.5 percent, payable semi-annually on
    March 1 and September 1. Southwest used the net
    proceeds from the issuance of the notes, approximately
    $380 million, for general corporate purposes. During 2003,
    the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement
    relating to these notes. See Note 10 for further
    information.

In fourth quarter 1999, the Company entered into two identical

13-year

floating rate financing arrangements, whereby it borrowed a
    total of $56 million from French banking partnerships.
    Although the interest on the borrowings are at floating rates,
    the Company estimates that, considering the full effect of the
    “net present value benefits” included in the
    transactions, the effective economic yield over the

13-year

term
    of the loans will be approximately LIBOR minus 67 basis points.
    Principal and interest are payable semi-annually on June 30
    and December 31 for each of the loans and the Company may
    terminate the arrangements in any year on either of those dates,
    with certain conditions. The Company pledged two aircraft as
    collateral for the transactions.

On February 28, 1997, the Company issued $100 million
    of senior unsecured


/


% Debentures
    due March 1, 2027. Interest is payable semi-annually on
    March 1 and September 1. The debentures may be
    redeemed, at the option of the Company, in whole at any time or
    in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the
    greater of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued
    interest at the date of redemption or the sum of the present
    values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and
    interest thereon, discounted to the date of redemption at the
    comparable treasury rate plus 20 basis points, plus accrued
    interest at the date of redemption.

During 1992, the Company issued $100 million of senior
    unsecured


/


% Notes
    due September 1, 2007. Interest is payable semi-annually on
    March 1 and September 1. The notes are not redeemable

The net book value of the assets pledged as collateral for the
    Company’s secured borrowings, primarily aircraft and
    engines, was $164 million at December 31, 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, aggregate annual principal
    maturities of debt and capital leases (not including amounts
    associated with interest rate swap agreements, and interest on
    capital leases) for the five-year period ending
    December 31, 2011, were $123 million in 2007,

    respectively. The majority of the Company’s terminal
    operations space, as well as 84 aircraft, were under operating
    leases at December 31, 2006. Future minimum lease payments

    a stated percentage of the lessor’s defined cost of the
    aircraft.

9.

Consolidation
    of Reservations Centers

In November 2003, the Company announced the consolidation of its
    nine Reservations Centers into six, effective February 28,
    2004. This decision was made in response to the established
    shift by Customers to the internet as a preferred way of booking
    travel. The Company’s website,

www.southwest.com

,
    now accounts for over 70 percent of ticket bookings and, as
    a consequence, demand for phone contact has dramatically
    decreased. During first quarter 2004, the Company closed its
    Reservations Centers located in Dallas, Texas, Salt Lake City,
    Utah, and Little Rock, Arkansas. The Company provided the 1,900
    affected Employees at these locations the opportunity to
    relocate to another of the Company’s remaining six centers.
    Those Employees choosing not to relocate, approximately
    55 percent of the total affected, were offered support
    packages, which included severance pay, flight benefits, medical
    coverage, and job-search assistance, depending on length of
    service with the Company. The total cost associated with the
    Reservations Center consolidation, recognized in first quarter
    2004, was approximately $18 million. Employee severance and
    benefit costs were reflected in “Salaries, wages, and
    benefits,” and the majority of other costs in “Other

    Income. The total remaining amount accrued (not yet paid) was
    immaterial at December 31, 2006.

10.

Derivative
    and Financial Instruments

Fuel
    Contracts

Airline operators are inherently dependent upon energy to
    operate and, therefore, are impacted by changes in jet fuel
    prices. Jet fuel and oil consumed during 2006, 2005, and 2004
    represented approximately 26.2 percent, 19.6 percent,
    and 16.3 percent of Southwest’s operating expenses,
    respectively. The reason that fuel and oil has become an
    increasingly large portion of the Company’s operating
    expenses has been due to the dramatic increase in all energy
    prices over this period. The Company endeavors to acquire jet
    fuel at the lowest possible cost. Because jet fuel is not traded
    on an organized futures exchange, there are limited
    opportunities to hedge directly in jet fuel. However, the
    Company has found that financial derivative instruments in other
    commodities, such as crude oil, and refined products such as
    heating oil and unleaded gasoline, can be useful in decreasing
    its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company does not
    purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for
    trading purposes.

The Company has utilized financial derivative instruments for
    both short-term and long-term time frames. In addition to the
    significant protective fuel derivative positions the Company had
    in place during 2006, the Company also has significant future
    positions. The Company currently has a mixture of purchased call
    options, collar structures, and fixed price swap agreements in
    place to protect against nearly 95 percent of its 2007
    total anticipated jet fuel requirements at average crude oil
    equivalent prices of approximately $50 per barrel, and has
    also added refinery margins on most of those positions. Based on
    current growth plans, the Company also has fuel derivative
    contracts in place for 65 percent of its expected fuel
    consumption for 2008 at approximately $49 per barrel, over
    50 percent for 2009 at approximately $51 per barrel,
    over 25 percent for 2010 at $63 per barrel,
    approximately 15 percent in 2011 at $64 per barrel, and
    15 percent in 2012 at $63 per barrel.

Upon proper qualification, the Company endeavors to account for
    its fuel derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, as defined
    in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

, as amended (SFAS 133). Under SFAS 133,
    all derivatives designated as hedges that meet certain
    requirements are granted special hedge accounting treatment.
    Generally, utilizing the special hedge accounting, all periodic
    changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as hedges
    that are considered to be effective, as defined, are recorded in
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income” until the
    underlying jet fuel is consumed. See Note 11 for further
    information on Accumulated other comprehensive income. The
    Company is exposed to the risk that periodic changes will not be
    effective, as defined, or that the derivatives will no longer
    qualify for special hedge accounting. Ineffectiveness, as
    defined, results when the change in the fair value of the
    derivative instrument exceeds the change in the value of the
    Company’s expected future cash outlay to purchase and
    consume jet fuel. To the extent that the periodic changes in the
    fair value of the derivatives are not effective, that
    ineffectiveness is recorded to Other gains and losses in the
    income statement. Likewise, if a hedge ceases to qualify for
    hedge accounting, any change in the fair value of derivative
    instruments since the last period is recorded to Other gains and
    losses in the income statement in the period of the change.

Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative
    positions based in other crude oil related commodities,
    especially given the magnitude of the current fair market value
    of the Company’s fuel derivatives and the recent volatility
    in the prices of refined products. Due to the volatility in
    markets for crude oil and related products, the Company is
    unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period,
    including the loss of hedge accounting, which could be
    determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the
    aggregate. This may result, and has resulted, in increased
    volatility in the Company’s results. The significant
    increase in the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized
    gains and losses on derivative contracts settling in future
    periods recorded during 2005 and 2006 has been due to a number
    of factors. These factors included: the significant fluctuation
    in energy prices, the number of derivative positions the Company
    holds, significant weather events that have affected refinery
    capacity and the production of refined products, and the
    volatility of the different types of products the Company uses
    for protection. The number of instances in which the Company has
    discontinued hedge accounting for specific hedges and for
    specific refined products, such as unleaded gasoline, has
    increased recently, primarily due to these reasons. In these
    cases, the Company has determined that the hedges will not
    regain effectiveness in the time period remaining until
    settlement and therefore must discontinue special hedge



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

accounting, as defined by SFAS 133. When this happens, any
    changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are marked
    to market through earnings in the period of change. However,
    even though these derivatives may not qualify for SFAS 133
    special hedge accounting, the Company continues to hold the
    instruments as it believes they continue to represent good
    “economic hedges” in its goal to minimize jet fuel
    costs. As the fair value of the Company’s hedge positions
    increases in amount, there is a higher degree of probability
    that there will be continued variability recorded in the income
    statement and that the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and
    unrealized gains or losses for changes in value of the
    derivatives recorded in future periods will be material. This is
    primarily due to the fact that small differences in the
    correlation of crude oil related products are leveraged over
    large dollar volumes.

Primarily due to the significant decrease in fair values of the
    Company’s fuel derivatives and the loss of hedge accounting
    for specific hedges, during 2006, the Company recognized
    approximately $101 million of net losses in Other (gains)
    losses, net, related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges and
    the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel derivatives. Of
    this net total, approximately $42 million was unrealized,

mark-to-market

losses for changes in fair value of derivatives as a result of
    the discontinuation of hedge accounting for certain contracts
    that will settle in future periods; $20 million was
    ineffectiveness and

mark-to-market

losses related to contracts that settled during 2006; and
    $39 million was losses related to unrealized
    ineffectiveness for changes in value of hedges designated for
    future periods. During 2005, the Company recognized
    approximately $110 million of additional gains in Other
    (gains) losses, net, related to the ineffectiveness of its
    hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel
    derivatives. Of this amount, approximately $77 million was
    gains from unrealized,

mark-to-market

changes in the fair value of derivatives due to the
    discontinuation of hedge accounting for certain contracts that
    will settle in future periods, approximately $9 million was
    gains from ineffectiveness associated with hedges designated for
    future periods, and $24 million was ineffectiveness and

mark-to-market

gains related to hedges that settled during 2005. During 2004,
    the Company recognized approximately $13 million of
    additional expense in “Other (gains) losses, net,”
    related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges. During 2006, 2005,
    and 2004, the Company recognized approximately $52 million,
    $35 million, and $24 million of net expense,
    respectively, related to amounts excluded from the
    Company’s measurements of hedge effectiveness, in Other
    (gains) losses, net.

During 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company recognized pretax gains
    in Fuel and oil expense of $634 million, $892 million,
    and $455 million, respectively, from hedging activities. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately $42 million
    and $83 million due from third parties from settled
    derivative contracts is included in Accounts and other
    receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
    fair value of the Company’s financial derivative
    instruments at December 31, 2006, was a net asset of
    approximately $999 million. The current portion of these
    financial derivative instruments, $369 million, is
    classified as Fuel derivative contracts and the long-term
    portion, $630 million, is classified as Other assets in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the derivative
    instruments, depending on the type of instrument, was determined
    by the use of present value methods or standard option value
    models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those
    observed in underlying markets.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately
    $584 million in unrealized gains, net of tax, in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income related to fuel hedges.
    Included in this total are approximately $243 million in
    net unrealized gains that are expected to be realized in
    earnings during 2007.

Interest
    Rate Swaps

The Company is party to an interest rate swap agreement relating
    to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due
    2012, in which the floating rate is set in arrears. Under the
    agreement, the Company pays the London InterBank Offered Rate
    (LIBOR) plus a margin every six months and receives 6.5% every
    six months on a notional amount of $385 million until 2012.
    The average floating rate paid under this agreement during 2006
    is estimated to be 7.63 percent based on actual and forward
    rates at December 31, 2006.

The Company is also a party to an interest rate swap agreement
    relating to its $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured
    notes due 2014, in which the floating rate is set in advance.
    Under this agreement, the Company pays LIBOR plus a margin every
    six months and receives 5.25% every six months on a notional
    amount of $350 million until 2014. The average floating
    rate paid under this agreement during 2006 was 5.69 percent.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

The primary objective for the Company’s use of interest
    rate hedges is to reduce the volatility of net interest income
    by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities.
    The Company’s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair
    value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. The fair value of the
    interest rate swap agreements, which are adjusted regularly, are
    recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as necessary, with a
    corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the long-term
    debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements,
    excluding accrued interest, at December 31, 2006, was a
    liability of approximately $30 million and is recorded in
    “Other deferred liabilities” in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. In accordance with fair value hedging, the
    offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value
    of long-term debt. See Note 7.

Outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the Company
    to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
    counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not
    expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their
    obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial
    instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a
    positive fair value at the reporting date. To manage credit
    risk, the Company selects and periodically reviews
    counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a
    single counterparty, and monitors the market position of the
    program and its relative market position with each counterparty.
    At December 31, 2006, the Company had agreements with eight
    counterparties containing early termination rights

and/or

bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if
    market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or
    credit ratings fall below certain levels. At December 31,
    2006, the Company held $540 million in fuel hedge related
    cash collateral deposits under these bilateral collateral
    provisions. These collateral deposits serve to decrease, but not
    totally eliminate, the credit risk associated with the
    Company’s hedging program. The cash deposits, which can
    have a significant impact on the Company’s cash balance and
    cash flows as of and for a particular operating period, are
    included in “Accrued liabilities” on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet and are included as “Operating cash
    flows” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the
    Company’s long-term debt and fuel contracts at
    December 31, 2006 were as follows:

Comprehensive income includes changes in the fair value of
    certain financial derivative instruments, which qualify for
    hedge accounting, and unrealized gains and losses on certain
    investments. Comprehensive income totaled $189 million,
    $959 million, and $510 million for 2006, 2005, and
    2004, respectively. The differences between “Net

Common
    Stock

The Company has one class of common stock. Holders of shares of
    common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if
    declared by the Board of Directors and are entitled to one vote
    per share on all matters submitted to a vote of the
    shareholders. At December 31, 2006, the Company had
    208 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance
    pursuant to Employee stock benefit plans (of which
    39 million shares have not been granted.)

In January 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the
    Company’s common stock, utilizing proceeds from the
    exercise of Employee stock options. Repurchases were made in
    accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or
    in private transactions from time to time, depending on market
    conditions. During first quarter 2005, the Company completed
    this program. In total, the Company repurchased approximately
    20.9 million of its common shares during the course of the
    program.

In 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized three
    separate programs for the repurchase of up to a total of
    $1.0 billion of the Company’s Common Stock —
    $300 million authorized in January 2006, $300 million
    authorized in May 2006, and $400 million authorized in
    November 2006. Repurchases have been made in accordance with
    applicable securities laws in the open market or in private
    transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions.
    Through December 31, 2006, these programs resulted in the
    2006 repurchase of a total of 49 million shares for
    $800 million.

Stock
    Plans

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company has share-based compensation plans covering the
    majority of its Employee groups, including plans adopted via
    collective bargaining, a plan covering the Company’s Board
    of Directors, and plans related to employment contracts with one
    Executive Officer of the Company. Effective January 1,
    2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions
    of SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”
    using the modified retrospective transition method. Among other
    items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of APB 25 and the
    intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to
    recognize the cost of Employee services received in exchange for
    awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value
    of those awards, in the financial statements.

Under the modified retrospective method, compensation cost is
    recognized in the financial statements beginning with the
    effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for
    all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on
    the requirements of SFAS 123 for all unvested awards
    granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R. In
    addition, results for prior periods were retrospectively
    adjusted in first quarter 2006 utilizing the pro forma
    disclosures in those prior financial statements, except as
    noted. The Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 reflects share-based
    compensation cost of $80 million, $80 million, and
    $135 million, respectively. The total tax benefit
    recognized from share-based compensation arrangements for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, was
    $27 million, $25 million, and $46 million,
    respectively. The Company’s earnings



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

before income taxes (net of profitsharing), and net earnings for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, were reduced by
    $68 million and $41 million, respectively, compared to
    the previous accounting method under APB 25. Net income per
    share, basic and diluted were reduced by $.05 and $.05 for the
    year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the previous
    accounting method under APB 25. As a result of the
    SFAS 123R retroactive application, for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, net income was reduced by
    $55 million, net income per share, basic was reduced by
    $.08, and net income per share, diluted was reduced by $.06. For
    the year ended December 31, 2004, net income was reduced by
    $89 million, net income per share, basic was reduced by
    $.12, and net income per share, diluted was reduced by $.10.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company was
    required to record benefits associated with the tax deductions
    in excess of recognized compensation cost as an operating cash
    flow. However, SFAS 123R requires that such benefits be
    recorded as a financing cash inflow and corresponding operating
    cash outflow. In the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash
    Flows for years ended December 31, 2005, and 2004, the
    respective $47 million, and $23 million tax benefits
    classified as financing cash flows (and corresponding operating
    cash outflows) have been conformed to the current year
    presentation.

Stock
    Plans

The Company has stock plans covering Employees subject to
    collective bargaining agreements (collective bargaining plans)
    and stock plans covering Employees not subject to collective
    bargaining agreements (other Employee plans). None of the
    collective bargaining plans were required to be approved by
    shareholders. Options granted to Employees under collective
    bargaining plans are non-qualified, granted at or above the fair
    market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of
    grant, and generally have terms ranging from six to twelve
    years. Neither Executive Officers nor members of the
    Company’s Board of Directors are eligible to participate in
    any of these collective bargaining plans. Options granted to
    Employees through other Employee plans are both qualified as
    incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
    and non-qualified stock options, granted at the fair market
    value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant,
    and have ten-year terms. All of the options included under the
    heading of “Other Employee Plans” have been approved
    by shareholders, except the plan covering non-management,
    non-contract Employees, which had options outstanding to
    purchase 5.5 million shares of the Company’s Common
    Stock as of December 31, 2006. Although the Company does
    not have a formal policy per se, upon option exercise, the
    Company will typically issue Treasury stock, to the extent such
    shares are available.

Vesting terms for the collective bargaining plans differ based
    on the grant made, and have ranged in length from immediate
    vesting to vesting periods in accordance with the period covered
    by the respective collective bargaining agreement. For
    “Other Employee Plans,” options vest and become fully
    exercisable over three, five, or ten years of continued
    employment, depending upon the grant type. For grants in any of
    the Company’s plans that are subject to graded vesting over
    a service period, Southwest recognizes expense on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
    entire award. None of the Company’s grants include
    performance-based or market-based vesting conditions, as defined.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
    grant using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    following weighted-average assumptions were used for grants made
    under the fixed option plans for the current and prior year:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use
    in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that
    have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
    addition, option valuation models require the input of somewhat
    subjective assumptions including expected stock price
    volatility. For 2006 and 2005, the Company has relied on
    observations of both historical volatility trends as well as
    implied future volatility observations as determined by
    independent third parties. For both 2006 and 2005 stock option
    grants, the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Company utilized expected volatility based on the expected life
    of the option, but within a range of 25% to 27%. Prior to 2005,
    the Company relied exclusively on historical volatility as an
    input for determining the estimated fair value of stock options.
    In determining the expected life of the option grants, the
    Company has observed the actual terms of prior grants with
    similar characteristics, the actual vesting schedule of the
    grant, and assessed the expected risk tolerance of different
    optionee groups. The risk-free interest rates used, which were
    actual U.S. Treasury zero-coupon rates for bonds matching
    the expected term of the option as of the option grant date,
    ranged from 4.26% to 5.24% for the year ended December 31,
    2006, from 3.37% to 4.47% for 2005, and from 2.16% to 4.62% for
    2004.

The fair value of options granted under the fixed option plans
    during the year ended December 31, 2006, ranged from $2.48
    to $6.99, with a weighted-average fair value of $5.47. The fair
    value of options granted under the fixed option plans during
    2005 ranged from $2.90 to $6.79, with a weighted-average fair
    value of $4.49. The fair value of options granted under the
    fixed option plans during 2004 ranged from $3.45 to $7.83, with
    a weighted-average fair value of $4.49.

    $262 million, $179 million, and $106 million,
    respectively. The total fair value of shares vesting during the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, was
    $112 million, $96 million, and $114 million,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2006, there was
    $74 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related
    to share-based compensation arrangements, which is expected to
    be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.
    The total recognition period for the remaining unrecognized
    compensation cost is approximately ten years; however, the
    majority of this cost will be recognized over the next two
    years, in accordance with vesting provisions.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

Under the amended 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP),
    which has been approved by shareholders, the Company is
    authorized to issue up to a remaining balance of
    7.8 million shares of Common Stock to Employees of the
    Company. These shares may be issued at a price equal to
    90 percent of the market value at the end of each monthly
    purchase period. Common Stock purchases are paid for through
    periodic payroll deductions. For the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, participants under the
    plan purchased 1.2 million shares, 1.5 million shares,
    and 1.5 million shares at average prices of $14.86, $13.19,
    and $13.47, respectively. The weighted-average fair value of
    each purchase right under the ESPP granted for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, which is equal to the
    ten percent discount from the market value of the Common Stock
    at the end of each monthly purchase period, was $1.65, $1.47,
    and $1.50, respectively.

Non-Employee
    Director Grants and Incentive Plan

During the term of the 1996 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan
    (1996 Plan), upon initial election to the Board, non-Employee
    Directors received a one-time option grant to purchase
    10,000 shares of Southwest Common Stock at the fair market
    value of such stock on the date of the grant. The Company’s
    1996 Plan, which is administered by the Compensation Committee
    of the Board of Directors, has expired and no additional options
    may be granted from the plan. Outstanding stock options to the
    Board under the 1996 Plan become exercisable over a period of
    five years from the grant date and have a term of 10 years.
    In 2001, the Board adopted the Southwest Airlines Co. Outside
    Director Incentive Plan. The purpose of the plan is to align
    more closely the interests of the non-Employee Directors with
    those of the Company’s Shareholders and to provide the
    non-Employee Directors with retirement income. To accomplish
    this



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

purpose, the plan compensates each non-Employee Director based
    on the performance of the Company’s Common Stock and defers
    the receipt of such compensation until after the non-Employee
    Director ceases to be a Director of the Company. Pursuant to the
    plan, on the date of the 2002 Annual Meeting of Shareholders,
    the Company granted 750 non-transferable Performance Shares to
    each non-Employee Director who had served as a Director since at
    least May 2001. Thereafter, on the date of each Annual Meeting
    of Shareholders, the Company will grant 750 Performance Shares
    to each non-Employee Director who has served since the previous
    Annual Meeting. A Performance Share is a unit of value equal to
    the Fair Market Value of a share of Southwest Common Stock,
    based on the average closing sale price of the Common Stock as
    reported on the New York Stock Exchange during a specified
    period. On the 30th calendar day following the date a
    non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a Director of the
    Company for any reason, Southwest will pay to such non-Employee
    Director an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common
    Stock during the 30 days preceding such last date of
    service multiplied by the number of Performance Shares then held
    by such Director. The plan contains provisions contemplating
    adjustments on changes in capitalization of the Company. The
    Company accounts for grants made under this plan as liability
    awards, as defined, and since the awards are not stock options,
    they are not reflected in the above tables. The fair value of
    the awards as of December 31, 2006, which is not material
    to the Company, is included in Accrued liabilities in the
    accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Taxes

A portion of the Company’s granted options qualify as
    incentive stock options (ISO) for income tax purposes. As such,
    a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost
    related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the
    fact that an ISO does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit
    unless there is a disqualifying disposition. Stock option grants
    of non-qualified options result in the creation of a deferred
    tax asset, which is a temporary difference, until the time that
    the option in exercised. Due to the treatment of incentive stock
    options for tax purposes, the Company’s effective tax rate
    from year to year is subject to variability.

Employee
    Retirement Plans

Defined
    Contribution Plans

The Company has defined contribution plans covering
    substantially all Southwest Employees. The Southwest Airlines
    Co. Profitsharing Plan is a money purchase defined contribution
    plan and Employee stock purchase plan. The Company also sponsors
    Employee savings plans under section 401(k) of the Internal
    Revenue Code, which include Company matching contributions. The
    401(k) plans cover substantially all Employees. Contributions
    under all defined contribution plans are primarily based on
    Employee compensation and performance of the Company.

Company contributions to all retirement plans expensed in 2006,
    2005, and 2004 were $301 million, $264 million, and
    $200 million, respectively.

Postretirement
    Benefit Plans

The Company provides postretirement benefits to qualified
    retirees in the form of medical and dental coverage. Employees
    must meet minimum levels of service and age requirements as set
    forth by the Company, or as specified in collective bargaining
    agreements with specific workgroups. Employees meeting these
    requirements, as defined, may use accrued sick time to pay for
    medical and dental premiums from the age of retirement until
    age 65.

The following table shows the change in the Company’s
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005:

The assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant
    effect on the amounts reported for the Company’s plan. A

The Company’s plans are unfunded, and benefits are paid as
    they become due. For 2006, both benefits paid and Company
    contributions to the plans were each $5 million. For 2005,
    both benefits paid and Company contributions to the plans were
    each $2 million. Estimated future benefit payments expected
    to be paid for each of the next five years are $6 million
    in 2007, $8 million in 2008, $10 million in 2009,
    $12 million in 2010, $15 million in 2011, and
    $106 million for the next five years thereafter.

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition
    and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158. SFAS 158
    required the Company to recognize the funded status (i.e., the
    difference between the fair value of plan assets and the
    projected benefit obligations) of its benefit plans in the
    December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet, with a
    corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    income, net of tax. The net adjustment to accumulated other
    comprehensive income at adoption of $11 million
    ($7 million net of tax) represents the net unrecognized
    actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs. The
    effects of adopting the provisions of SFAS 158 on the
    Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31,
    2006, are presented in the following table.

The following table shows the calculation of the accrued

For the year 2004, Southwest Airlines Co. had a tax net
    operating loss of $616 million for federal income tax
    purposes. The Company carried a portion of this net operating
    loss back to prior periods, resulting in a $35 million
    refund of federal taxes previously paid. This refund was
    received during 2005. The Company applied a portion of this
    2004 net operating loss to the 2005 and 2006 tax years,
    resulting in the payment of no regular federal income taxes for
    these years. The remaining portion of the Company’s federal
    net operating loss that can be carried forward to future years
    is estimated at $59 million, and expires in 2024.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Southwest Airlines Co. as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Southwest Airlines Co. at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, in 2006 the Company changed its method of accounting
    for scheduled airframe inspection and repairs on a retrospective
    basis, changed its method of accounting for share-based
    compensation using the modified-retrospective method, and
    changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefit
    plans.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Southwest Airlines Co.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission and our report dated January 30,
    2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting, that Southwest Airlines Co. maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Southwest Airlines’ management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Southwest
    Airlines Co. maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
    Also, in our opinion, Southwest Airlines Co. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Southwest Airlines Co. as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholder’s equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006 of Southwest Airlines Co. and our report
    dated January 30, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The
    Company maintains controls and procedures designed to ensure
    that it is able to collect the information it is required to
    disclose in the reports it files with the SEC, and to record,
    process, summarize and disclose this information within the time
    periods specified in the rules of the SEC. Based on an
    evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report
    conducted by the Company’s management, with the
    participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial
    Officers, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers
    believe that these controls and procedures are effective to
    ensure that the Company is able to collect, process and disclose
    the information it is required to disclose in the reports it
    files with the SEC within the required time periods.

The certifications of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer required under Section 302 of
    the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been filed as Exhibits 31.1 and
    31.2 to this report. Additionally, in 2006 the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer certified to the New York Stock Exchange
    (“NYSE”) that he was not aware of any violation by the
    Company of the NYSE’s corporate governance listing
    standards.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

Management of the Company is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board
    of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
    published financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation.

Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and
    Chief Financial Officers, assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework. Based on this
    assessment,



management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and
    Chief Financial Officers, believes that, as of December 31,
    2006, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
    has been audited by Ernst & Young, LLP, the independent
    registered public accounting firm who also audited the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.
    Ernst & Young’s attestation report on
    management’s assessment of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting is included herein.

    Exchange have issued multiple new regulations, requiring the
    implementation of policies and procedures in the corporate
    governance area. In complying with new regulations requiring the
    institution of policies and procedures, it has been the goal of
    Southwest’s Board of Directors and senior leadership to do
    so in a way which does not inhibit or constrain Southwest’s
    unique culture, and which does not unduly impose a bureaucracy
    of forms and checklists. Accordingly, formal, written policies
    and procedures have been adopted in the simplest possible way,
    consistent with legal requirements, including a Code of Ethics
    applicable to the Company’s principal executive officer,
    principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer or
    controller. The Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines,
    its charters for each of its Audit, Compensation, Nominating and
    Corporate Governance Committees and its Code of Ethics covering
    all Employees are available on the Company’s website,

    Financial Officer, Controller, and persons performing similar
    functions on the Company’s website, at
