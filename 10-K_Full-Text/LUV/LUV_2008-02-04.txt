PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Southwest Airlines Co. is a major passenger airline that
    provides scheduled air transportation in the United States.
    Based on the most recent data available from the
    U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”),
    Southwest is the largest air carrier in the United States, as
    measured by the number of originating passengers boarded and the
    number of scheduled domestic departures. Southwest commenced
    Customer Service on June 18, 1971, with three Boeing 737
    aircraft serving three Texas cities — Dallas, Houston,
    and San Antonio. As of December 31, 2007, Southwest
    operated 520 Boeing 737 aircraft and provided service to
    64 cities in 32 states throughout the United States.
    In 2007, Southwest recommenced service to San Francisco
    International Airport.

Southwest focuses principally on point-to-point, rather than

hub-and-spoke,

service, providing its markets with frequent, conveniently timed
    flights and low fares. As of December 31, 2007, Southwest
    served 411 nonstop city pairs. Historically, Southwest has
    served predominantly short-haul routes, with high frequencies.
    In recent years, Southwest has complemented this service with
    more medium to long-haul routes, including transcontinental
    service.

Southwest has a low cost structure, enabling it to charge low
    fares. Adjusted for stage length, Southwest has lower unit
    costs, on average, than most major network carriers.
    Southwest’s low cost advantage is facilitated by reliance
    upon a single aircraft type, an operationally efficient route
    structure, and highly productive Employees.

Fuel Cost
    Impact and Related Growth Plans and Initiatives

Fuel prices can have a significant impact on Southwest’s
    profitability. From October 1, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007, the average cost per gallon for jet fuel
    was $1.87. Southwest’s average cost of jet fuel, net of
    hedging gains and excluding fuel taxes, over the past five years
    was as follows:

Fuel costs, coupled with evidence of slowing economic growth and
    the impact of labor costs, led to the Company’s decision in
    2007 to slow capacity growth through a combination of schedule
    adjustments and fleet changes. The Company has been working on
    optimizing its flight schedule by reducing frequency on less
    profitable routes and reallocating capacity to potentially more
    rewarding markets. This in turn has allowed the Company to
    reduce the number of aircraft it will add to its fleet in 2008.
    As discussed further below under “Properties,” the
    Company has also adjusted its aircraft deliveries from Boeing.

In addition to schedule adjustments, the Company has developed
    several initiatives designed to enhance Customer Service and to
    help offset increasing costs through improving future revenues.
    These initiatives include, among others:

•

Implementation of a new Customer boarding method for flights;

•

Commencement of a significant gate re-design to enhance the
    airport experience for Customers;

•

Introduction of a new fare structure, including a “Business
    Select” product;

•

Introduction of enhancements to the Company’s Rapid Rewards
    frequent flyer program;

•

Launch of a new advertising campaign;

•

Announcement of an expansion of the Company’s GDS (Global
    Distribution System) and corporate travel account
    efforts; and

•

Exploration of international codeshare alliances.

The Company’s initiatives are discussed in more detail
    below under “Operating Strategies and Marketing.” Fuel
    costs and Southwest’s fuel hedging activities are discussed
    in more detail below under “Risk Factors” and
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

Regulation

The airline industry is regulated heavily, especially by the
    federal government. Examples of such regulation include:

Economic
    and Operational Regulation

•

Aviation Taxes.

The statutory authority for
    the federal government to collect aviation taxes, which are
    used, in part, to finance the nation’s airport and air
    traffic control systems, and the authority of the



Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) to expend
    those funds must be periodically reauthorized by the U.S.
    Congress. This authority was scheduled to expire on
    September 30, 2007. However, Congress has approved a
    temporary extension of this authority through February 29,
    2008. Similar temporary extensions or a reauthorization for a
    fixed term are expected to occur in 2009. Other proposals being
    considered by Congress in connection with the FAA
    reauthorization legislation include: (i) the imposition of
    new user fees on jet-powered aircraft, (ii) an increase in
    the amount of airport passenger facility charges, and
    (iii) the adoption of new unfunded mandates on commercial
    airlines such as passenger-rights standards and labor protection
    provisions, any of which could have an impact on the
    Company’s operations.

•

U.S. Department of Transportation.

The
    DOT has significant regulatory jurisdiction over passenger
    airlines. To provide passenger transportation in the United
    States, a domestic airline is required to hold a Certificate of
    Public Convenience and Necessity issued by the DOT. A
    certificate is unlimited in duration and generally permits the
    Company to operate among any points within the United States and
    its territories and possessions. The DOT may revoke a
    certificate, in whole or in part, for intentional failure to
    comply with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders, or
    the terms of the certificate itself. The DOT also has
    jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection
    matters such as advertising, denied boarding compensation,
    baggage liability, and access for persons with disabilities. The
    DOT may impose civil penalties on air carriers for violations of
    its regulations in these areas.

•

Wright Amendment.

The International Air
    Transportation Competition Act of 1979, as amended (the
    “Act”), imposed restrictions on the provision of air
    transportation to and from Dallas Love Field. The applicable
    portion of the Act, commonly known as the “Wright
    Amendment,” impacted Southwest’s scheduled service by
    prohibiting the carrying of nonstop and through passengers on
    commercial flights between Dallas Love Field and all states
    outside of Texas, with the exception of the following states
    (the “Wright Amendment States”): Alabama, Arkansas,
    Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, and
    Oklahoma. In addition, the Wright Amendment only permitted an
    airline to offer flights between Dallas Love Field and the
    Wright Amendment States to the extent the airline did not offer
    or provide any through service or ticketing with another air
    carrier at Dallas Love Field and did not market service to or
    from Dallas Love Field and any point outside of a Wright
    Amendment State. In other words, a Customer could not purchase a
    single ticket between Dallas Love Field and any destination
    other than a Wright Amendment State. The Wright Amendment did
    not restrict flights operated with aircraft having 56 or fewer
    passenger seats, nor did it restrict Southwest’s intrastate
    Texas flights or its air service to or from points other than
    Dallas Love Field.

In 2006, Southwest entered into an agreement with the City of
    Dallas, the City of Fort Worth, American Airlines, Inc.,
    and the DFW International Airport Board. Pursuant to this
    agreement, the five parties sought enactment of legislation to
    amend the Act. Congress responded by passing the Wright
    Amendment Reform Act of 2006 (the “Reform Act”). The
    Reform Act immediately repealed through service and ticketing
    restrictions, thereby allowing the purchase of a single ticket
    between Dallas Love Field and any U.S. destination (while
    still requiring the Customer to make a stop in a Wright
    Amendment State), and reduced the maximum number of gates
    available for commercial air service at Dallas Love Field from
    32 to 20. Southwest currently uses 15 gates at Dallas Love
    Field. Pursuant to the Reform Act and local agreements with the
    City of Dallas with respect to gates, Southwest can expand
    scheduled service from Dallas Love Field and intends to do so.
    The Reform Act also provides for substantial repeal of the
    remainder of the Wright Amendment in 2014.

Safety
    and Health Regulation

The Company and its third-party maintenance providers are
    subject to the jurisdiction of the FAA with respect to the
    Company’s aircraft maintenance and operations, including
    equipment, ground facilities, dispatch, communications, flight
    training personnel, and other matters affecting air safety. To
    ensure compliance with its regulations, the FAA requires
    airlines to obtain, and Southwest has obtained, operating,
    airworthiness, and other certificates. These certificates are
    subject to suspension or revocation for cause. In addition,
    pursuant to FAA regulations, the Company has established, and
    the FAA has approved, the Company’s operations
    specifications and a maintenance program for the Company’s



aircraft, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major
    overhauls. The FAA, acting through its own powers or through the
    appropriate U.S. Attorney, also has the power to bring
    proceedings for the imposition and collection of fines for
    violation of the Federal Aviation Regulations.

The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and
    local laws and regulations relating to occupational safety and
    health, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration
    and Food and Drug Administration regulations.

Security
    Regulation

Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001,
    Congress enacted the Aviation and Transportation Security Act
    (the “Aviation Security Act”). The Aviation Security
    Act established the Transportation Security Administration (the
    “TSA”), a division of the U.S. Department of
    Homeland Security that is responsible for certain civil aviation
    security matters. The Aviation Security Act also mandated, among
    other things, improved flight deck security, deployment of
    federal air marshals onboard flights, improved airport perimeter
    access security, airline crew security training, enhanced
    security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail,
    employees, and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of
    security screening personnel, additional provision of passenger
    data to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and enhanced
    background checks. Under the Aviation Security Act,
    substantially all security screeners at airports are federal
    employees, and significant other elements of airline and airport
    security are overseen and performed by federal employees,
    including federal security managers, federal law enforcement
    officers, and federal air marshals.

Enhanced security measures have impacted the Company’s
    business. In particular, they have had a significant impact on
    the airport experience for passengers. For example, in the third
    quarter of 2006, the TSA mandated new security measures in
    response to a terrorist plot uncovered by authorities in London.
    These rules, which primarily regulate the types of liquid items
    that can be carried onboard aircraft, have had a negative impact
    on air travel, especially on shorthaul routes and with business
    travelers. Although the TSA has relaxed some of its
    requirements, the Company is not able to predict the ongoing
    impact, if any, that these security changes will have on
    passenger revenues, both in the shortterm and the longterm. The
    Company has made significant investments to address the impact
    of these types of regulations, including investments in
    facilities, equipment, and technology to process Customers
    efficiently and restore the airport experience. The
    Company’s Automated Boarding Passes and self service kiosks
    have reduced the number of lines in which a Customer must wait.
    In addition, the Company’s gate readers at all of its
    airports have improved the boarding reconciliation process. The
    Company also offers baggage checkin through self service kiosks
    at certain airport locations, as well as Internet checkin and
    transfer boarding passes at the time of checkin.

Enhanced security measures have also impacted the Company’s
    business through the imposition of security fees on the
    Company’s Customers and on the Company. Under the Aviation
    Security Act, funding for passenger security is provided in part
    by a $2.50 per enplanement security fee, subject to a maximum of
    $5.00 per one-way trip. The Aviation Security Act also allows
    the TSA to assess an Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee
    (“ASIF”) on each airline. Southwest’s ASIF
    liability was originally set at $24 million per year. Effective
    in 2005, the TSA unilaterally increased the amount to $50
    million. Southwest and 22 other airlines are joined in
    litigation presently pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals
    against the TSA to challenge that increase.

Environmental
    Regulation

The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 gives airport
    operators the right, under certain circumstances, to implement
    local noise abatement programs, so long as they do not
    unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or
    the national air transportation system. Some airports have
    established airport restrictions to limit noise, including
    restrictions on aircraft types to be used, and limits on the
    number of hourly or daily operations or the time of operations.
    These types of restrictions can cause curtailments in service or
    increases in operating costs and could limit the ability of
    Southwest to expand its operations at the affected airports.

The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and
    local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
    environment, including the discharge or disposal of materials
    such as chemicals, hazardous waste, and aircraft deicing fluid.
    Regulatory developments pertaining to such things as control of
    engine exhaust emissions from ground support equipment and
    prevention of leaks from underground aircraft fueling systems
    could increase operating costs in the airline industry. The
    Company does not believe, however, that presently pending
    environmental regulatory developments will have a material
    impact on the Company’s capital expenditures or otherwise
    adversely affect its operations, operating costs,



or competitive position. However, legislation has been
    introduced in the U.S. Congress to regulate so-called
    “green house gas emissions.” The legislation could
    impose unknown costs or restrictions on all
    transportation-related activities, the impact of which is
    presently unpredictable. Additionally, in conjunction with
    airport authorities, other airlines, and state and local
    environmental regulatory agencies, the Company is undertaking
    voluntary investigation or remediation of soil or groundwater
    contamination at several airport sites. The Company does not
    believe that any environmental liability associated with such
    sites will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    operations, costs, or profitability.

The Company has appointed a “Green Team” to target
    areas of environmental improvement in all aspects of the
    Company’s business, while at the same time remaining true
    to the Company’s low cost philosophy. As part of this
    initiative, during 2008, the Company will be publishing an
    Environmental Report describing the Company’s strategies to
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions and addressing other
    environmental matters such as waste management and recycling.

Regulation
    of Customer Service Practices

From time to time, the airline industry has been faced with
    possible legislation dealing with certain Customer Service
    practices. As a compromise with Congress, the industry, working
    with the Air Transport Association, has responded by adopting
    and filing with the DOT written plans disclosing commitments to
    improve performance. Southwest Airlines’ Customer Service
    Commitment is a comprehensive plan that embodies the Mission
    Statement of Southwest Airlines: dedication to the highest
    quality of Customer Service delivered with a sense of warmth,
    friendliness, individual pride, and Company Spirit. The Customer
    Service Commitment can be reviewed by clicking on “About
    Southwest” at

www.southwest.com

. The DOT and
    Congress monitor the industry’s plans, and there can be no
    assurance that legislation or regulations will not be proposed
    in the future to regulate airline Customer Service practices.

Operating
    Strategies and Marketing

General
    Operating Strategies

Southwest focuses principally on point-to-point service, rather
    than the

hub-and-spoke

service provided by most major U.S. airlines. The

“hub-and-spoke”

system concentrates most of an airline’s operations at a
    limited number of hub cities and serves most other destinations
    in the system by providing one-stop or connecting service
    through the hub. Point-to-point service allows for more direct
    nonstop routing than the hub and spoke system, minimizing
    connections, delays, and total trip time. As a result,
    approximately 78 percent of Southwest’s Customers fly
    nonstop. Southwest’s average aircraft trip stage length in
    2007 was 629 miles with an average duration of
    approximately 1.8 hours, as compared to an average aircraft
    trip stage length of 622 miles and an average duration of
    approximately 1.7 hours in 2006. Point-to-point service
    also enables Southwest to provide its markets with frequent,
    conveniently timed flights and low fares. Examples of markets
    offering frequent daily flights are: Dallas Love Field to
    Houston Hobby, 30 weekday roundtrips; Phoenix to Las Vegas,
    18 weekday roundtrips; and Los Angeles International to
    Oakland, 20 weekday roundtrips. Southwest complements these
    high-frequency shorthaul routes with longhaul nonstop service
    between markets such as Phoenix and Tampa Bay, Las Vegas and
    Orlando, and Nashville and Oakland.

Southwest serves many conveniently located secondary or downtown
    airports such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Chicago
    Midway, Baltimore-Washington International, Burbank, Manchester,
    Oakland, San Jose, Providence,
    Ft. Lauderdale/Hollywood, and Long Island Islip airports,
    which are typically less congested than other airlines’ hub
    airports. This operating strategy enables the Company to achieve
    high asset utilization because aircraft can be scheduled to
    minimize the amount of time they are on the ground. This in turn
    reduces the number of aircraft and gate facilities that would
    otherwise be required. The Company is also able to simplify
    scheduling, maintenance, flight operations, and training
    activities by operating only one aircraft type, the Boeing 737.
    All of these strategies enhance the Company’s ability to
    sustain high Employee productivity and reliable ontime
    performance.

Simplified
    Fare Structure

Southwest employs a relatively simple fare structure, featuring
    low, unrestricted, unlimited, everyday coach fares, as well as
    even lower fares available on a restricted basis. As of
    November 1, 2007, Southwest’s highest non-codeshare,
    oneway unrestricted walkup fare offered was $399 for its longest
    flights. Substantially lower walkup fares are generally
    available on Southwest’s short and medium haul flights.

In November 2007, Southwest announced enhancements to its fare
    structure and unveiled a new fare display on its web site,

www.southwest.com

. Instead of a large display with
    numerous fare categories, Southwest has streamlined the process
    by bundling fares into three



major fare columns: “Business Select,”
    “Business,” and “Wanna Get Away,” with the
    goal of making it easier for Customers to choose the fare they
    want. The new “Business Select” fare is part of the
    Company’s initiative to increase offerings and improve
    productivity for the business traveler. Customers who purchase
    the Business Select fare are allowed to be among the first
    Customers to board the aircraft. They also receive extra Rapid
    Rewards credit for the flight and a free drink.

Enhanced
    Boarding Method and Updated Gate Design

During fourth quarter 2007, the Company introduced an enhanced
    boarding method, which is designed to significantly reduce the
    time a Customer spends standing in line at the gate. The
    enhanced boarding process automatically reserves a place for a
    Customer in the Customer’s boarding group at the time of
    check-in by assigning a specific position number within the A,
    B, or C boarding group. Customers then board the aircraft in
    that numerical order. The new boarding method also allows for
    future enhancements, such as product customization and
    additional incentives for business and leisure travelers.

The Company has also commenced modification of its gate areas
    with columns and signage that facilitate the new boarding
    process. The “extreme gate makeover” is also designed
    to improve the airport experience for all of the Company’s
    Customers by including (i) a business focused area with
    padded seats, tables with power outlets, power stations with
    stools, and a flat screen television for news programming; and
    (ii) a family area with smaller tables and chairs,
    “kid friendly” programming on a flat screen
    television, and power stations for charging electrical devices.
    The updated gate design is scheduled to be completed during 2008
    at virtually all airports served by the Company.

Rapid
    Rewards Frequent Flyer Program

Southwest’s frequent flyer program, Rapid Rewards, is based
    on trips flown rather than mileage. Rapid Rewards Customers earn
    a credit for each one-way trip flown or two credits for each
    roundtrip flown. Rapid Rewards Customers can also earn credits
    by using the services of non-airline partners, which include car
    rental agencies, hotels, and credit card partners, including the
    Southwest Airlines
    Chase

®

Visa card. Rapid Rewards offers two types of travel awards. The
    Rapid Rewards Award Ticket (“Award Ticket”) offers one
    free roundtrip award, valid to any destination available on
    Southwest, after the accumulation of 16 credits within
    24 months. The Rapid Rewards Companion Pass
    (“Companion Pass”) is granted for accumulating
    100 credits within a consecutive twelve-month period. The
    Companion Pass offers unlimited free roundtrip travel, to any
    destination available on Southwest, for a designated companion
    of the qualifying Rapid Rewards Member. For the designated
    companion to use this pass, the Rapid Rewards Member must
    purchase a ticket or use an Award Ticket. Additionally, the
    Rapid Rewards Member and designated companion must travel
    together on the same flight.

Award Tickets and Companion Passes are automatically generated
    when earned by the Customer rather than allowing the Customer to
    bank credits indefinitely. Award Tickets are valid for
    12 months after issuance and are subject to seat
    restrictions. Companion Passes have no seat restrictions or
    “Black out” dates.

The Company also sells credits to business partners, including
    credit card companies, hotels, and car rental agencies. These
    credits may be redeemed for Award Tickets having the same
    program characteristics as those earned by flying.

During 2007, the Company enhanced its Rapid Rewards program and
    rolled out a new business traveler focused marketing campaign.
    Rapid Rewards Members who fly 32 or more qualifying one-way
    flights within a

12-month

period receive priority boarding privileges for an entire year.
    In addition, if travel is purchased at least 36 hours prior
    to flight time, these passengers also receive the best boarding
    pass number available (generally, an “A” boarding
    pass). Customers on this “A-List” are also
    automatically checked in for their flight in advance of
    departure. During 2007, Southwest also introduced a new Freedom
    Award, which allows Rapid Rewards Members the opportunity to
    exchange two standard Award Tickets for one Freedom Award. The
    Freedom Award is free of seat restrictions, except for a limited
    number of blackout dates around major holidays.

Customers redeemed approximately 2.8 million,
    2.7 million, and 2.6 million Award Tickets and flights
    on Companion Passes during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
    The amount of free travel award usage as a percentage of total
    Southwest revenue passengers carried was 6.2 percent in
    2007, 6.4 percent in 2006, and 6.6 percent in 2005.
    The number of fully earned Award Tickets and partially earned
    awards outstanding at December 31, 2007 was approximately
    11.6 million, of which approximately 81 percent were
    partially earned awards. The number of fully earned Award
    Tickets and partially earned awards outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 was approximately 10.1 million, of
    which



approximately 81 percent were partially earned awards.
    However, due to the expected expiration of a portion of credits
    making up partial awards, not all of them will eventually turn
    into useable Award Tickets. In addition, not all Award Tickets
    will be redeemed for future travel. Since the inception of Rapid
    Rewards in 1987, approximately 15 percent of all fully
    earned Award Tickets have expired without being used. The number
    of Companion Passes outstanding at December 31, 2007 and
    2006 was approximately 65,000 and 58,000, respectively. The
    Company currently estimates that an average of three to four
    trips will be redeemed per outstanding Companion Pass.

The Company accounts for its Rapid Rewards program obligations
    by recording, at the time an award is earned, a liability for
    the estimated incremental cost of the use of flight awards the
    Company expects to be redeemed. The estimated incremental cost
    includes direct passenger costs such as fuel, food, and other
    operational costs, but does not include any contribution to
    overhead or profit. Revenue from the sale of credits to business
    partners and associated with future travel is deferred and
    recognized when the ultimate free travel award is flown or the
    credits expire unused. The liability for free travel awards
    earned but not used at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was not
    material to the Company’s business.

Southwest.com;
    Expansion of GDS Participation and Corporate Travel Account
    Efforts

Southwest was the first major airline to introduce a Ticketless
    travel option, eliminating the need to print and then process a
    paper ticket altogether, and the first to offer Ticketless
    travel through the Company’s web site at

www.southwest.com

. For the year ended December 31,
    2007, more than 95 percent of Southwest’s Customers
    chose the Ticketless travel option, and nearly 74 percent
    of Southwest’s passenger revenues came through its web site
    (including SWABiz revenues), which has become a vital part of
    the Company’s distribution strategy.

In 2007, in order to better attract business travelers,
    Southwest began exploring selling tickets through channels in
    addition to its own reservation system, web site, and the Sabre
    System. Southwest is continuing its efforts to provide travel
    agent and professional travel manager partners with increased
    and cost effective access to its fares and inventory. In
    particular, during 2007, Southwest announced an expansion of its
    GDS (Global Distribution System) and corporate travel account
    efforts through a ten-year content distribution agreement with
    Travelport’s Galileo, a leading provider of global
    distribution services. The agreement has recently been expanded
    to include Worldspan, another of Travelport’s global
    distribution systems. Through the agreement, Southwest intends
    that all of its published fares and inventory, with the
    exception of Southwest’s exclusive web fares, will
    eventually be available to Galileo-connected travel agencies in
    North America.

RNP

During 2007, Southwest announced an agreement with Naverus, an
    aviation consulting firm in Seattle, Washington, to partner on
    development of a Required Naviation Performance
    (“RNP”) program. RNP combines GPS (Global Positioning
    System), the capabilities of advanced aircraft avionics, and new
    flight procedures for the purpose of achieving safer, more
    efficient, and environmentally friendly flight operations. RNP
    procedures are designed to reduce fuel consumption, improve
    safety, and minimize emissions and noise, while simultaneously
    taking advantage of the high-performance characteristics that
    exist in an airline’s fleet.

Codesharing

Southwest implemented codesharing in 2005 with ATA Airlines.
    Under its codeshare arrangement with ATA, Southwest may market
    and sell tickets for certain flights on ATA that are identified
    by Southwest’s designator code (for example, “WN
    Flight 123”). Conversely, ATA may market and sell tickets
    under its code designator (TZ) for certain flights on Southwest.
    Any flight bearing a Southwest code designator that is operated
    by ATA is disclosed in Southwest’s reservations systems and
    on the Customer’s flight itinerary, boarding pass, and
    ticket, if a paper ticket is issued. As a result of the ATA
    codeshare arrangement, Southwest’s Customers are able to
    purchase single ticket service on Southwest connecting to
    ATA’s service to Hawaii and Dallas Fort Worth
    International Airport. Also, members of Southwest’s and
    ATA’s respective frequent flier programs are able to earn
    and redeem awards in the other carrier’s program. Finally,
    beginning in 2006, Southwest began selling ATA-only service at

www.southwest.com

. Other than the ATA arrangement,
    Southwest does not interline or offer joint fares with other
    airlines, nor does Southwest have any marketing or commuter
    feeder relationships with other carriers; however Southwest is
    currently exploring international codeshare opportunities.

Management
    Information Systems

Southwest is continuing to invest in technology to support the
    initiatives discussed above as well as Southwest’s ongoing
    operations. Southwest is currently



developing a system to replace its current point of sale
    application in the stations and its refunds system in the back
    office. Additionally, Southwest has purchased technology that
    will replace its existing Ticketless system and revenue
    accounting system. The new systems are designed to, among other
    things, enhance data flow and thereby increase Southwest’s
    operational efficiencies and Customer Service capabilities.
    Southwest is also working to replace its back office accounting
    systems, payroll system, and human resource information system,
    with a goal of completion sometime during 2009.

Competition

The airline industry is highly competitive. The Company believes
    the principal competitive factors in the industry are:

•

Fares;

•

Customer Service;

•

Costs;

•

Frequency and convenience of scheduling;

•

Frequent flyer benefits; and

•

Efficiency and productivity, including effective selection and
    use of aircraft.

Southwest currently competes with other airlines on all of its
    routes. Some of these airlines have larger fleets than Southwest
    and some may have wider name recognition in certain markets. In
    addition, some major U.S. airlines have established
    extensive marketing or codesharing alliances, including
    Northwest Airlines/Continental Airlines/Delta Air Lines;
    American Airlines/Alaska Airlines; and United Airlines/US
    Airways. These alliances are more extensive than
    Southwest’s arrangement with ATA Airlines and enable these
    carriers to expand their destinations and marketing
    opportunities. In addition, some airlines are able to offset
    less profitable domestic fares with more profitable
    international fares. As discussed above, the Company is
    evaluating international code sharing opportunities.

The Company is also subject to varying degrees of competition
    from surface transportation in its shorthaul markets. This
    competition can be more significant during economic downturns.
    Although price is a competitive factor in these instances, the
    Company believes frequency and convenience of scheduling,
    facilities, transportation safety and security procedures, and
    Customer Service are also of great importance to many passengers.

The competitive landscape for airlines has changed significantly
    over the last few years. Following the terrorist attacks on
    September 11, 2001, the airline industry, as a whole,
    incurred substantial losses through 2005. The war in Iraq and
    significant increases in the cost of fuel have exacerbated
    industry challenges. As a result, a number of carriers have
    sought relief from financial obligations in bankruptcy,
    including UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines; ATA
    Airlines; US Airways; Northwest Airlines Corporation, the parent
    of Northwest Airlines; and Delta Air Lines. UAL Corporation and
    ATA Airlines emerged from bankruptcy in 2006, and Northwest
    Airlines Corporation and Delta Air Lines emerged from bankruptcy
    in 2007. US Airways’ emergence from bankruptcy in 2005
    culminated in its merger with America West Airlines in September
    of that year. Other, smaller carriers have ceased operations
    entirely. In addition, post-9/11, many carriers shrank capacity,
    grounded their most inefficient aircraft, cut back on
    unprofitable service, and furloughed employees. Reorganization
    in bankruptcy, and even the threat of bankruptcy, has allowed
    carriers to decrease operating costs through renegotiated labor,
    supply, and financing contracts. As a result, differentials in
    cost structures between traditional

hub-and-spoke

carriers and low cost carriers have significantly diminished.
    Nevertheless, throughout this entire time period, Southwest has
    continued to maintain its cost advantage, improve Employee
    productivity, pursue steady, controlled growth, and provide
    outstanding Service to its Customers. The factors discussed
    above have, however, led to more intense competition in the
    airline industry, generally. In 2006, some carriers began
    reporting profitable results for the first time since 9/11.

The re-emerging competitiveness of some of the larger carriers,
    such as United, US Airways, and American, has put pressure on
    smaller carriers such as AirTran Airways, JetBlue, and Frontier.
    Like Southwest, several other carriers, large and small, have
    announced scaled back growth plans, and some carriers have
    expressed interest in industry consolidation. The Company cannot
    predict the timing or extent of any such consolidation or its
    impact (either positive or negative) on the Company’s
    operations or results of operations.

Insurance

The Company carries insurance of types customary in the airline
    industry and at amounts deemed adequate to protect the Company
    and its property and to comply both with federal regulations and
    certain of the Company’s credit and lease agreements. The
    policies principally provide coverage for public and passenger
    liability, property damage, cargo and baggage liability, loss or
    damage



to aircraft, engines, and spare parts, and workers’
    compensation.

Following the terrorist attacks, commercial aviation insurers
    significantly increased the premiums and reduced the amount of
    war-risk coverage available to commercial carriers. Through the
    2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, the
    federal government has continued to provide supplemental,
    first-party, war-risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers
    for renewable

60-day

periods, at substantially lower premiums than prevailing
    commercial rates and for levels of coverage not available in the
    commercial market. The government-provided supplemental coverage
    from the Wartime Act is currently set to expire on
    March 30, 2008. Although another extension beyond this date
    is expected, if such coverage is not extended by the government,
    the Company could incur substantially higher insurance costs or
    unavailability of adequate coverage in future periods.

Seasonality

The business of the Company is somewhat seasonal. Quarterly
    operating income and, to a lesser extent, revenues have
    historically tended to be lower in the first quarter (January 1
    - March 31) and fourth quarter (October 1 - December 31).

Employees

At December 31, 2007, Southwest had 34,378 active full-time
    equivalent Employees, consisting of 13,885 flight, 2,079
    maintenance, 13,921 ground, Customer, and fleet service, and
    4,493 management, accounting, marketing, and clerical personnel.

Southwest has ten collective bargaining agreements, which
    covered approximately 82 percent of Southwest’s
    Employees as of December 31, 2007. Southwest’s
    relations with labor unions are governed by the Railway Labor
    Act (the “RLA”), which establishes the right of
    airline employees to organize and bargain collectively. Under
    the RLA, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline
    and a labor union generally does not expire, but instead becomes
    amendable as of a stated date. If either party wants to modify
    the terms of the agreement, it must notify the other party in
    the manner required by the RLA

and/or

described in the agreement. After receipt of such notice, the
    parties must meet for direct negotiations, and, if no agreement
    is reached, either party may request the National Mediation
    Board (the “NMB”) to appoint a federal mediator. If no
    agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may determine that an
    impasse exists and offer binding arbitration to the parties. If
    either party rejects binding arbitration, a

30-day

“cooling off” period begins. At the end of this

30-day

period, the parties may engage in “self-help,” unless
    a Presidential Emergency Board is established to investigate and
    report on the dispute. The appointment of a Presidential
    Emergency Board maintains the “status quo” for an
    additional 60 days. If the parties do not reach agreement
    during this period, the parties may then engage in
    “self-help.” “Self-help” includes, among
    other things, a strike by the union or the airline’s
    imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the
    hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers. The
    following table sets forth the Company’s Employee groups
    and collective bargaining status:

    8,500 eligible Employees elected to participate in the program.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Southwest’s
    business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft
    fuel. Continued periods of high fuel costs and/or significant
    disruptions in the supply of fuel could adversely affect the
    Company’s results of operations.

Airlines are inherently dependent upon energy to operate and,
    therefore, are impacted by changes in the prices of jet fuel.
    The cost of fuel, which has been at historically high levels
    over the last three years, is largely unpredictable and has a
    significant impact on the Company’s results of operations.
    Jet fuel and oil consumed for fiscal 2007 and 2006 represented
    approximately 28 percent and 26 percent of
    Southwest’s operating expenses, respectively. In both
    years, jet fuel costs were the second largest expense incurred
    by the Company, following only salaries, wages, and benefits.
    These costs contributed to the Company’s decision during
    2007 to slow growth and could continue to impact growth
    decisions.

Fuel availability, as well as pricing, is also impacted by
    political and economic factors. The Company does not currently
    anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability;
    however, it is difficult to predict the future availability of
    jet fuel due to the following, among other, factors: dependency
    on foreign imports of crude oil and the potential for
    hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas; limited
    refining capacity; and the possibility of changes in
    governmental policies on jet fuel production, transportation,
    and marketing. Significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft
    fuel could adversely affect the Company’s business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.



The Company’s profitability is impacted in part by its
    ability to pass fuel cost increases through to the consumer in
    the form of fare increases. Due to the competitive nature of the
    airline industry, the Company’s ability to increase fares
    is limited, and it is not certain that future fuel cost
    increases can be covered by increasing fares. Fare increases are
    even more difficult to achieve in uncertain economic
    environments, as low fares are often used to stimulate demand.

From time to time the Company enters into fuel derivative
    contracts to protect against rising fuel costs. Changes in the
    Company’s overall fuel hedging strategy, the ability of the
    commodities used in fuel hedging (principally crude oil, heating
    oil, and unleaded gasoline) to qualify for special hedge
    accounting, and the effectiveness of the Company’s fuel
    hedges pursuant to highly complex accounting rules, are all
    significant factors impacting the Company’s results of
    operations. For more information on Southwest’s fuel
    hedging arrangements, see “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
    and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Southwest’s
    business is labor-intensive; Southwest could be adversely
    affected if it were unable to maintain satisfactory relations
    with any unionized or other Employee work group.

The airline business is labor intensive, and the Company’s
    results are subject to variations in labor-related job actions.
    Salaries, wages, and benefits represented 35.4 percent of
    the Company’s operating expenses for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. In addition, as of December 31,
    2007, approximately 82 percent of the Company’s
    Employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by
    labor unions. The Company’s Ramp, Operations, Provisioning,
    and Freight Agents are subject to an agreement with the
    Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO (“TWU”),
    which becomes amendable on June 30, 2008. The Company and
    TWU are in discussions on a new agreement. The Company’s
    Pilots are subject to an agreement with the Southwest Airlines
    Pilots’ Association (“SWAPA”), which became
    amendable during September 2006. The Company and SWAPA are in
    discussions on a new agreement. Although, historically, the
    Company’s relationships with its Employees have been good,
    the following items could have a significant impact on the
    Company’s results of operations: results of labor contract
    negotiations, employee hiring and retention rates, pay rates,
    outsourcing costs, the impact of work rules, and costs for
    health care.

Southwest’s
    business is affected by many changing economic conditions and
    other conditions beyond its control.

The Company’s business, and the airline industry in
    general, is particularly impacted by changes in economic
    conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as
    higher unemployment rates, higher interest rates,
    housing-related pressures (such as recent issues in the subprime
    mortgage market), and increased operating costs can reduce
    consumer spending or cause shifts in spending. A general
    reduction or shift in discretionary spending can result in
    decreased demand for leisure and business travel and can also
    impact the Company’s ability to raise fares to counteract
    increased fuel and labor costs.

The Company’s business, and the airline industry in
    general, is also impacted by other conditions that are largely
    outside of the Company’s control, including, among others:

•

Actual or threatened war, terrorist attacks, and political
    instability;

•

Changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns,
    or demographic trends;

•

Actual or potential disruptions in the air traffic control
    system;

•

Increases in costs of safety, security, and environmental
    measures; and

•

Weather and natural disasters.

Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the
    number of passengers carried, a relatively small change in the
    number of passengers can have a disproportionate effect on an
    airline’s operating and financial results. Therefore, any
    general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of
    any of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s
    business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The
    Company relies on technology to operate its business and
    continues to implement substantial changes to its information
    systems; any failure or disruption in the Company’s systems
    could adversely impact the Company’s
    operations.

The Company has historically been dependent on automated systems
    and technology to operate its business, enhance Customer Service
    and back office support systems, and increase Employee
    productivity, including the Company’s computerized airline
    reservation system, flight operations systems, telecommunication
    systems, website at

www.southwest.com

, Automated Boarding



Passes system, and its self service kiosks. The Company has
    become increasingly dependent on its systems and technology to
    maintain and support the growth of its business. Therefore, the
    Company’s ability to expand and update its information
    technology infrastructure in response to its growth and changing
    needs is increasingly important to the operation of its business
    generally and the implementation of its new initiatives. Any
    issues with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or
    any material failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security
    failure of these systems, could harm the Company’s ability
    to effectively operate its business. In addition, the
    Company’s growth strategies are dependent on its ability to
    effectively implement technology advancements.

The
    Company’s inability to successfully implement its revenue
    initiatives could adversely affect its results of
    operations.

As discussed above, the Company has implemented and intends to
    continue to implement revenue initiatives that are designed to
    help offset increasing costs. The implementation of the
    Company’s initiatives has and will involve significant
    investments by the Company of time and money and could be
    impacted by (i) the Company’s ability to timely
    implement and maintain the necessary information technology
    systems and infrastructure (as discussed above), and
    (ii) the extent and timing of the Company’s investment
    of incremental operating expenses and capital expenditures to
    develop and implement its initiatives and the Company’s
    corresponding ability to effectively control operating expenses.
    Because the Company has limited experience with some of its
    strategic initiatives, it cannot ensure that they will be
    successful or profitable either over the short or long term. The
    Company’s ability to effectively and timely prioritize and
    implement its initiatives will also affect when and if they will
    have a positive impact on the Company’s profitability.

The
    travel industry continues to face on-going security concerns and
    cost burdens; further threatened or actual terrorist attacks, or
    other hostilities, could significantly harm the Company’s
    industry and its business.

The attacks of September 11, 2001, materially impacted, and
    continue to impact, air travel and the results of operations for
    Southwest and the airline industry generally. The Department of
    Homeland Security and the TSA have implemented numerous security
    measures that affect airline operations and costs. Substantially
    all security screeners at airports are now federal employees,
    and significant other elements of airline and airport security
    are now overseen and performed by federal employees, including
    federal security managers, federal law enforcement officers, and
    federal air marshals. Enhanced security procedures, including
    enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail,
    employees, and vendors, introduced at airports since the
    terrorist attacks of September 11 have increased costs to
    airlines and have from time to time impacted demand for air
    travel.

Additional terrorist attacks, even if not made directly on the
    airline industry, or the fear of such attacks or other
    hostilities (including elevated national threat warnings or
    selective cancellation or redirection of flights due to terror
    threats) could have a further significant negative impact on
    Southwest and the airline industry. Additional international
    hostilities could potentially have a material adverse impact on
    the Company’s results of operations.

Airport
    capacity constraints and air traffic control inefficiencies
    could limit the Company’s growth; changes in or additional
    governmental regulation could increase the Company’s
    operating costs or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to
    conduct business.

Almost all commercial service airports are owned

and/or

operated by units of local or state government. Airlines are
    largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide
    adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost.
    Similarly, the federal government singularly controls all
    U.S. airspace, and airlines are completely dependent on the
    FAA to operate that airspace in a safe, efficient, and
    affordable manner. As discussed above under
    “Business — Regulation,” airlines are also
    subject to other extensive regulatory requirements. These
    requirements often impose substantial costs on airlines. The
    Company’s results of operations may be affected by changes
    in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies having
    jurisdiction over its operations, including, but not limited to:

•

Increases in airport rates and charges;

•

Limitations on airport gate capacity or other use of airport
    facilities;

•

Increases in taxes;

•

Changes in the law that affect the services that can be offered
    by airlines in particular markets and at particular airports;

•

Restrictions on competitive practices;



•

The adoption of regulations that impact customer service
    standards, such as security standards; and

•

The adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise
    regulations.

The
    airline industry is intensely competitive.

As discussed in more detail above under
    “Business — Competition,” the airline
    industry is extremely competitive. Southwest’s competitors
    include other major domestic airlines, as well as regional and
    new entrant airlines, and other forms of transportation,
    including rail and private automobiles. Southwest’s
    revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers in the
    areas of capacity, pricing, scheduling, codesharing, and
    promotions.

Southwest’s
    low cost structure is one of its primary competitive advantages,
    and many factors could affect the Company’s ability to
    control its costs.

Factors affecting the Company’s ability to control its
    costs include the price and availability of fuel, results of
    Employee labor contract negotiations, Employee hiring and
    retention rates, costs for health care, capacity decisions by
    the Company and its competitors, unscheduled required aircraft
    airframe or engine repairs, regulatory requirements, ability to
    access capital or financing at competitive rates in financial
    markets, and future financing decisions made by the Company. In
    addition, a key contributor to the Company’s low cost
    structure is its use of a single aircraft type, the Boeing 737.
    Although the Company is able to purchase some of these aircraft
    from parties other than Boeing, most of its purchases are direct
    from Boeing. Therefore, if the Company were unable to acquire
    additional aircraft from Boeing, or Boeing were unable or
    unwilling to provide adequate support for its products, the
    Company’s operations could be adversely impacted. In
    addition, the Company’s dependence on a single aircraft
    type could result in downtime for part or all of the
    Company’s fleet if mechanical or regulatory issues relating
    to the Boeing 737 aircraft type arise. However, given the
    Company’s years of experience with the Boeing 737 aircraft
    type and its longterm relationship with Boeing, the Company
    believes the advantages of operating a single fleet type
    outweigh the risks of its single aircraft strategy.

In 2007, the Company announced a reduction in its planned growth
    rate for fourth quarter 2007 and for full year 2008. A portion
    of this growth slowdown will be achieved through changes in the
    Company’s aircraft deliveries from Boeing. In 2008, the
    Company also plans to return from lease or sell a total of 22
    aircraft. In total, at December 31, 2007, the Company had
    firm orders, options and purchase rights for the purchase of
    Boeing 737 aircraft as follows:

Ground
    Facilities and Services

Southwest leases terminal passenger service facilities at each
    of the airports it serves, to which it has made various
    leasehold improvements. The Company leases the land and
    structures on a long-term basis for its maintenance centers
    (located at Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Phoenix Sky
    Harbor, and Chicago Midway), its flight training center at
    Dallas Love Field (which houses seven 737 simulators), and its
    corporate headquarters, also located at Dallas Love Field. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company operated six reservation
    centers. The reservation centers located in Chicago,
    Albuquerque, and Oklahoma City occupy leased space. The Company
    owns its Houston, Phoenix, and San Antonio reservation
    centers.

The Company performs substantially all line maintenance on its
    aircraft and provides ground support services at most of the
    airports it serves. However, the Company has arrangements with
    certain aircraft maintenance firms for major component
    inspections and repairs for its airframes and engines, which
    comprise the majority of the Company’s annual aircraft
    maintenance costs.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims
    arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not
    limited to, examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
    The IRS regularly examines the Company’s federal income tax
    returns and, in the course of those examinations, proposes
    adjustments to the Company’s federal income tax liability
    reported on such returns. It is the Company’s practice to
    vigorously contest those proposed adjustments that it deems
    lacking merit. The Company’s management does not expect the
    outcome in any of its currently ongoing legal proceedings or the
    outcome of any proposed adjustments presented to date by the
    IRS, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Year in
    Review

Several events were significant for Southwest during 2007. For
    example, Southwest:

* Extended its string of consecutive profitable years to 35 and
    consecutive profitable quarters to 67. Both of these marks are
    unmatched in the modern era of aviation results.

* Implemented a new Customer boarding method for flights to
    significantly reduce the average time a Customer spends waiting
    in line at the gate, while retaining the Company’s famous
    open seating policy once aboard the aircraft.

* Introduced a new fare structure including a “Business
    Select” product, which enables Customers to be among the
    first to board the aircraft. We also unveiled enhancements to
    our Rapid Rewards program.

* Began a significant gate re-design to enhance the airport
    experience for Customers, to be installed at virtually all
    airports served by the Company.

* Grew the Company’s fleet by 39 Boeing

737-700

aircraft to a total of 520 737s as of December 31, 2007.

* Earned $727 million (on a cash basis, before
    profitsharing and income taxes) from the expiration/settlement
    of fuel derivative instruments the Company had previously
    entered into to protect against jet fuel price increases.

* Incurred a one-time $25 million charge (before
    profitsharing and income taxes) related to an early retirement
    program that was offered by the Company and accepted by more
    than 600 Employees during third quarter 2007, as one of many
    efforts underway to improve the Company’s future
    profitability.

* Announced an expansion of our GDS (Global Distribution System)
    and corporate travel account efforts through an agreement with
    Travelport’s Galileo and Worldspan.

* Recommenced service to San Francisco International
    Airport, with the highest initial concentration of flights of
    any new city in the Company’s history.

* Repurchased 66 million shares of Company common stock
    totaling $1.0 billion through programs authorized by the
    Company’s Board of Directors.

Although the Company’s 2007 net income of
    $645 million ($.84 per share, diluted) exceeded its
    2006 net income of $499 million ($.61 per share,
    diluted), the increase was entirely driven by certain gains and
    losses, recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended
    (SFAS 133), that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in
    future periods. In fact, the Company’s operating income,
    which excludes these items, actually declined 15.3 percent
    from 2006 to 2007, primarily due to the significant increase in
    fuel costs, which the Company was not able to recover through
    increased revenues. The airline revenue environment was more
    difficult than the Company envisioned coming into 2007. This was
    due to a slowing economy as well as continued competitive
    pressures from both new airlines as well as those that have
    significantly reduced their cost structures through the
    bankruptcy process or the threat of bankruptcy. The Company did
    raise fares several times during 2007 in an attempt to offset
    fuel cost pressures; however, these increases did not keep up
    with the rapidly increasing fuel prices.

Looking ahead to 2008, the Company believes it has retained, and
    in some cases strengthened, its low-cost competitive advantages
    as demonstrated by its protective fuel hedging position,
    excellent Employees, and strong balance sheet. These enable
    Southwest to respond quickly to potential industry consolidation
    and to favorable market opportunities in the face of an
    uncertain economy and record energy prices. Based on current and
    projected energy prices for 2008 and expected growth plans, the
    Company believes net cash expenditures for jet fuel, which
    exclude certain FAS 133 gains and losses, could increase
    more than $500 million compared to 2007, even including the
    effects of fuel derivative contracts the Company has in place as
    of January 2008. The Company’s fuel derivative contracts in
    place for 2008 provide protection for over 70 percent of
    the Company’s expected jet fuel consumption at an average
    price of approximately $51 per barrel of crude oil. The Company
    is also currently expecting a significant increase in its
    aircraft engine maintenance activity in 2008. The Company will
    attempt to overcome the impact of higher anticipated 2008 fuel
    prices and other cost pressures through improved revenues and
    continued focus on non-fuel costs. Based on this current
    outlook, Southwest has reduced its previously planned growth
    rate for 2008. The Company currently plans to grow its fleet by
    a net seven aircraft. The Company will add 29 new

737-700

aircraft from Boeing, but plans to return from lease or sell a
    total of 22 aircraft, resulting in a net available seat mile
    (ASM) capacity



increase of four to five percent. For first quarter 2008, the
    Company’s year-over-year capacity increase is expected to
    slightly exceed six percent. Based on current plans, the
    Company’s fleet is scheduled to total 527 737s by the end
    of 2008.

Results
    of Operations

    Compared With 2006

Southwest’s profit of $645 million ($.84 per share,
    diluted) in 2007 was an increase of $146 million, or
    29.3 percent, compared to the Company’s 2006 net
    income of $499 million ($.61 per share, diluted). However,
    the Company’s net profit results in both 2007 and 2006
    include certain gains and losses, recorded in accordance with
    SFAS 133, that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in
    future periods. These adjustments, which are related to the
    ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for
    certain fuel derivatives, are included in “Other (gains)
    losses,” which is below the operating income line, in both
    periods. In 2007, these adjustments totaled net gains of
    $360 million. For 2006, these adjustments totaled net
    losses of $101 million. Therefore, Southwest believes
    operating income provides a better indication of the
    Company’s financial performance for both 2007 and 2006 than
    does net income. Southwest’s 2007 operating income was
    $791 million, a decrease of $143 million, or
    15.3 percent, compared to 2006. The decrease in operating
    income was driven primarily by a substantial increase in fuel
    expense, despite the fact that the Company once again benefited
    tremendously from its fuel hedging program. The Company had
    instruments in place to protect against over 90 percent of
    its fuel consumption needs at an average crude oil equivalent
    price of $50 per barrel. This resulted in a $686 million
    reduction to Fuel and oil expense during 2007, although, even
    with this protection, the Company’s average jet fuel cost
    per gallon increased from $1.53 in 2006 to $1.70 in 2007.
    Although fuel prices began 2007 at moderately high levels, they
    quickly increased and stayed at record levels throughout most of
    the second half of the year. Market crude oil prices flirted
    with $100 per barrel several times during 2007 and market
    (unhedged) jet fuel prices reached as high as $2.87 per gallon
    during the second half of the year.

Operating
    Revenues

Consolidated operating revenues increased $775 million, or
    8.5 percent, primarily due to a $707 million, or
    8.1 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase
    in passenger revenues was primarily due to an increase in
    capacity, as the Company added aircraft and flights, resulting
    in a 7.5 percent increase in available seat miles compared
    to 2006. The Company purchased a total of 37 new Boeing

737-700

aircraft during 2007, and added another two leased

737-700s

from a previous owner, resulting in the addition of 39 aircraft
    for the year. The Company attempted to combat high fuel prices
    through modest fare increases. However, general economic
    conditions as well as significant low-fare competition made it
    difficult to raise fares as much as the Company had done in
    2006. The Company’s passenger revenue yield per RPM
    (passenger revenues divided by revenue passenger miles)
    increased 1.2 percent compared to 2006. Unit revenue (total
    revenue divided by available seat miles) also increased
    0.9 percent compared to 2006 levels, as a result of the
    higher RPM yield. The Company has been encouraged by more recent
    year-over-year unit revenue trends, which improved each month
    during fourth quarter 2007. The improved trends have continued
    thus far in first quarter 2008. Because of the uncertainty
    surrounding our nation’s overall economy, however, it is
    difficult for the Company to precisely predict first quarter
    2008 revenues.

Consolidated freight revenues decreased $4 million, or
    3.0 percent, versus 2006. A $10 million, or
    8.5 percent, increase in freight revenues, resulting
    primarily from higher rates, was more than offset by a
    $14 million decline in mail revenues. The lower mail
    revenues were due to the Company’s decision to discontinue
    carrying mail for the U.S. Postal Service effective as of
    the end of second quarter 2006. The Company expects an increase
    in consolidated freight revenues during first quarter 2008,
    primarily due to an increase in capacity and higher rates
    charged. “Other revenues” increased $72 million,
    or 35.6 percent, compared to 2006, primarily from higher
    commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with
    certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored
    Chase

®

Visa card. The Company currently expects another increase in
    first quarter 2008, also due to higher commissions earned, and
    at a somewhat comparable rate to the 2007 increase.



Operating
    Expenses

Consolidated operating expenses for 2007 increased
    $918 million, or 11.3 percent, compared to a
    7.5 percent increase in capacity. Historically, changes in
    operating expenses for airlines are typically driven by changes

The Company’s 2007 CASM (cost per available seat mile)
    increased 3.4 percent compared to 2006. Approximately
    80 percent of this increase was solely due to the increase
    in fuel expense, net of gains from the Company’s fuel
    hedging program. The remainder of the increase was due to higher
    maintenance expense. All other operating expense categories
    combined to be approximately flat compared to 2006. Due to
    higher fuel prices, the Company has intensified its focus on
    controlling non-fuel costs and continues to mitigate wage rate
    and benefit cost pressures through productivity and efficiency
    improvements. The Company’s headcount per aircraft at
    December 31, 2007, was 66, versus a year-ago level of 68.
    From the end of 2003 to the end of 2007, Southwest’s
    headcount per aircraft decreased 22 percent, as the Company
    implemented various technology improvements, which improved
    efficiency and enabled the Company to grow capacity without a
    commensurate increase in headcount. Based on current cost
    trends, the Company expects first quarter 2008 unit costs
    to increase from first quarter 2007’s 8.93 cents, due
    primarily to a significant increase in fuel costs and the
    continuation of higher maintenance costs. The higher expected
    fuel costs are due to the fact that the Company’s
    protective position as to fuel derivative instruments is not as
    favorable as first quarter 2007, and current physical (unhedged)
    jet fuel prices are significantly higher than the prior year.

On an absolute dollar basis, Salaries, wages, and benefits
    increased $161 million, primarily from a $204 million
    increase in salaries and wages, partially offset by a
    $43 million decrease in benefits. The dollar increase in
    salaries and wages was due primarily to a 5.2 percent
    headcount increase, and the dollar decrease in benefits was due
    primarily to a $33 million decrease in profitsharing,
    attributable to lower income available for profitsharing, and a
    $43 million decrease in share-based compensation, due to
    fewer Employee stock options becoming vested during 2007 versus
    2006. These benefits decreases were partially offset by higher
    healthcare costs. Although the Company’s net income was
    higher than 2006, income available for profitsharing was lower,
    since the Company’s profitsharing plan does not consider
    the unrealized gains

and/or

losses the Company records in its fuel hedging program as a
    result of SFAS 133. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense
    per ASM decreased 2.1 percent compared to 2006, primarily
    due to lower profitsharing expense and lower share-based
    compensation expense, despite the increase in ASMs. See
    Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information on SFAS 133 and fuel hedging, and
    Note 13 for further information on share-based
    compensation. Based on current trends, the Company expects
    salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM in first quarter 2008 to
    be in line with first quarter 2007’s unit cost.

The Company’s Pilots are subject to an agreement with the
    Southwest Airlines Pilots’ Association (“SWAPA”),
    which became amendable during September 2006. The Company and
    SWAPA are currently in discussions on a new agreement.

The Company’s Flight Attendants are subject to an agreement
    with the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO
    (“TWU”), which becomes amendable in June 2008.

The Company’s Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, and Freight
    Agents are subject to an agreement with the TWU, which becomes
    amendable in July 2008. However,



the Company and TWU began negotiations on a new agreement in
    January 2008.

The Company’s Stock Clerks are subject to an agreement with
    the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the
    Company’s Mechanics are subject to an agreement with the
    Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association. Both of these
    agreements become amendable in August 2008.

The Company’s Customer Service and Reservations Agents are
    subject to an agreement with the International Association of
    Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, which becomes
    amendable in November 2008.

Fuel and oil expense increased $398 million, and on a
    per-ASM basis increased 10.4 percent versus 2006.
    Approximately 60 percent of the dollar increase was due to
    an increase in fuel prices, and the remainder was from an
    increase in gallons consumed to support the 7.5 percent
    capacity increase versus 2006. On a per-ASM basis, nearly the
    entire increase was due to higher fuel prices. The fuel
    derivative instruments the Company held for 2007 were not as
    favorable as those held in the prior year, as they were at
    higher average crude-oil equivalent prices than the instruments
    that settled/expired in 2006. Despite this, the Company’s
    hedging program resulted in the realization of $727 million
    in cash settlements during 2007. These settlements generated a
    2007 reduction to Fuel and oil expense of $686 million,
    compared to the prior year when the Company’s fuel
    derivative instruments resulted in a $634 million reduction
    to Fuel and oil expense. Even with these significant hedge
    positions in both years, the Company’s jet fuel cost per
    gallon increased 11.1 percent versus 2006. The average cost
    per gallon of jet fuel in 2007 was $1.70 compared to $1.53 in
    2006, excluding fuel-related taxes and net of hedging gains. See
    Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2007
    increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the
    Company has taken to improve the fuel efficiency of its
    aircraft, including the addition of blended winglets to all of
    the Company’s

737-700

aircraft. The Company is also in the process of installing
    blended winglets on a significant number of its

737-300

aircraft.

The Company holds a significant fuel hedge position for 2008,
    although for a lower percentage of forecasted consumption than
    in 2007. As of mid-January 2008, the Company is nearly
    75 percent protected with fuel derivative instruments for
    its first quarter 2008 jet fuel requirements, at an average
    crude oil equivalent price of $51 per barrel, and the majority
    of these positions effectively perform like option
    contracts — allowing the Company to benefit in most
    cases from energy price decreases. During first quarter 2007,
    market prices (unhedged) for jet fuel averaged $1.81 per gallon,
    and the Company had fuel derivatives in place to protect against
    nearly 100 percent of its fuel usage at a crude oil
    equivalent price of $50 per barrel. January 2008 average market
    prices (unhedged) for jet fuel have been in the $2.60 to $2.65
    range. Based on this difference in protection and current market
    conditions, the Company expects its first quarter 2008 jet fuel
    cost per gallon to be approximately $2.00 per gallon, excluding
    the impact of any hedge ineffectiveness and derivatives that do
    not qualify for hedge accounting as defined in SFAS 133. In
    addition, the Company had fuel derivative contracts in place for
    over 70 percent of its expected fuel consumption for the
    remainder of 2008 at approximately $51 per barrel; over
    55 percent in 2009 at approximately $51 per barrel; nearly
    30 percent in 2010 at approximately $63 per barrel; over
    15 percent in 2011 at $64 per barrel; and over
    15 percent in 2012 at $63 per barrel.

Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM increased
    21.6 percent compared to 2006, while increasing
    $148 million on a dollar basis. On a dollar basis, engine
    expense accounted for over 45 percent of the increase and
    airframe expense accounted for over 43 percent of the
    increase. With respect to airframe expense, the Company
    completed significantly more planned airframe inspection and
    repair events than in the prior year. These events, which are
    required based on the number of flight hours each individual
    aircraft has flown, were higher in number as well as cost per
    event, and were also due to the ongoing transition to a new
    airframe maintenance program for

737-300

and

737-500

aircraft which began in 2006. In engine expense, there was a
    significant increase in repairs for the Company’s

737-700

aircraft engines primarily due to the maturation of this fleet,
    which was introduced in 1997, and more repair events than
    expected. On a per-ASM basis, approximately 48 percent of
    the increase in maintenance materials and repairs was a result
    of the higher airframe expense, and approximately
    43 percent of the increase was due to the higher engine
    expense. In first quarter 2008, the Company expects an increase
    in maintenance materials and repairs per ASM compared to first
    quarter 2007 and fourth quarter 2007, due to higher engine
    expense for

737-700

aircraft as well as continued higher airframe expense from the
    transition of aircraft to the Company’s new airframe
    maintenance program for

737-300

and

737-500

aircraft.

Aircraft rentals expense per ASM decreased 5.9 percent and,
    on a dollar basis, decreased slightly. The decrease per ASM was
    due primarily to the fact that the Company increased overall
    ASMs by 7.5 percent, but the number of aircraft on
    operating lease increased by only two from 2006 to 2007. The
    Company added 37



purchased aircraft to its fleet during 2007, and leased two
    additional

737-700

aircraft. The Company currently expects similar year-over-year
    rental expense comparisons for first quarter 2008.

Landing fees and other rentals increased $65 million on a
    dollar basis and 5.7 percent on a per-ASM basis, compared
    to 2006. The dollar increase was due primarily to an increase in
    airport gate space to support the increase in capacity and trips
    flown versus 2006. On a per-ASM basis, the increase was due
    primarily to higher rates paid for airport space. The Company
    currently expects a year-over-year increase in landing fees and
    other rentals per ASM for first quarter 2008, primarily due to
    higher rates paid for airport space.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $40 million
    on a dollar basis compared to 2006, but was flat on a per-ASM
    basis. The dollar increase was due primarily to 37 new

737-700

aircraft purchased during 2007. Based on current fleet and
    growth plans, the Company expects a similar year-over-year
    comparison for first quarter 2008 on a per-ASM basis. See
    Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    information on the Company’s future aircraft deliveries.

Other operating expenses increased $108 million but were
    flat on a per-ASM basis, compared to 2006. On a dollar basis,
    approximately 20 percent of the increase was due to an
    increase in revenue-related costs associated with the
    8.1 percent increase in passenger revenues (such as credit
    card processing fees) and approximately 20 percent was due
    to higher personnel expenses (which includes items associated
    with flight crew travel, such as hotel and per diem costs)
    caused by the increase in capacity and trips flown. Excluding
    anticipated gains from the sale of aircraft, the Company
    currently expects an increase in other operating expenses on a
    per-ASM basis for first quarter 2008 compared to first quarter
    2007, assuming increased revenues.

Other

“Other expenses (income)” included interest expense,
    capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and
    losses. Interest expense decreased by $9 million, or
    7.0 percent, primarily due to the Company’s repayment
    of $729 million in debt during 2006 and 2007. This was
    partially offset by the issuance of $800 million in new
    debt instruments in 2006 and 2007; however, the timing of the
    new debt issued compared to the debt repaid resulted in lower
    expense for 2007. The Company currently expects an increase in
    interest expense compared to 2007, primarily due to a higher
    average debt balance associated with recent borrowings in late
    2006 and in 2007. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for more information on long-term debt transactions.
    Capitalized interest declined slightly compared to 2006 due to a
    reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future
    aircraft deliveries. Interest income decreased $40 million,
    or 47.6 percent, primarily due to a decrease in average
    cash and short-term investment balances on which the Company
    earns interest. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for more information.

Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded
    in accordance with the Company’s hedging activities and
    SFAS 133. During 2007, the Company recorded significant
    gains related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges as well as to
    the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that
    were marked to market because they didn’t qualify for
    SFAS 133 hedge accounting. The gains resulted from the
    dramatic increase in the fair value of the Company’s
    portfolio of fuel derivative instruments as commodity prices
    reached record levels. During 2006, the Company recorded losses
    related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges, as well as the
    increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were
    marked to market because they didn’t qualify for
    SFAS 133 hedge accounting, as commodity prices declined
    during that year. The following table displays the components of
    Other (gains) losses, net, for the years ended December 31,

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before
    taxes, increased to 39.0 percent in 2007 from
    36.8 percent in 2006. The higher 2007 rate included an
    $11 million ($.01 per share, diluted) net addition related
    to a revision in Illinois income tax laws enacted in 2007. The
    2006 rate included a $9 million net reduction related to a
    revision in the State of Texas franchise tax law enacted during
    2006. The Company currently expects its 2008 effective tax rate
    to be between 36 and 37 percent. The lower expected 2008
    rate is primarily due to the January 2008 reversal of the 2007
    Illinois tax law change, that resulted in the $11 million
    tax increase. The Company currently expects to reverse the
    $11 million net charge during first quarter 2008.

    Compared With 2005

The Company’s consolidated net income for 2006 was
    $499 million ($.61 per share, diluted), as compared to
    2005 net income of $484 million ($.60 per share,
    diluted), an increase of $15 million, or 3.1 percent.
    Operating income for 2006 was $934 million, an increase of
    $209 million, or 28.8 percent, compared to 2005. The
    2006 increase in operating income was due primarily to higher
    revenues from the Company’s fleet growth, improved load
    factors, and higher fares, which more than offset a significant
    increase in the cost of jet fuel. In both 2006 and 2005, the
    Company recognized adjustments related to the ineffectiveness of
    hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel
    derivatives, which are included in “Other (gains)
    losses.” For 2006, these adjustments totaled net losses of
    $101 million. For 2005, these adjustments totaled net gains
    of $110 million.

Operating
    Revenues

Consolidated operating revenues increased $1.5 billion, or
    19.8 percent, almost entirely due to a $1.5 billion,
    or 20.2 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The
    increase in passenger revenues was due primarily to an increase
    in capacity, an increase in RPM yield, and an increase in load
    factor. Approximately 45 percent of the increase in
    passenger revenue was due to the Company’s 8.8 percent
    increase in available seat miles compared to 2005. The Company
    increased available seat miles as a result of the addition of 36

737-700

aircraft. Approximately 35 percent of the increase in
    passenger revenue was due to a 6.9 percent increase in
    passenger yields. Average passenger fares increased
    11.4 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to less fare
    discounting because of strong demand for air travel coupled with
    the availability of fewer seats as a result of industrywide
    domestic capacity reductions. The remainder of the passenger
    revenue increase was due primarily to the 2.4 point increase in
    the Company’s load factor compared to 2005.

The airline revenue environment changed significantly from the
    first half of 2006 to the second half of the year. The Company
    believes this was due to both reduced demand related to domestic
    economic factors, as well as the effects of the increased
    carryon baggage restrictions put in place following the
    terrorist plot uncovered by London authorities in August 2006.
    The airline revenue environment regained some momentum during
    late fourth quarter 2006, and, despite growing capacity
    10 percent during the quarter, the Company achieved a
    record load factor of 70.2 percent at healthy yields, which
    resulted in a unit revenue growth rate of 4.2 percent.

Consolidated freight revenues increased slightly versus 2005. An
    $18 million, or 17.1 percent, increase in freight and
    cargo revenues, primarily as a result of higher rates charged,
    was almost entirely offset by lower mail revenues. The lower
    mail revenues were due to the Company’s decision to
    discontinue carrying mail for the U.S. Postal Service
    effective as of the end of second quarter 2006. “Other
    revenues” increased $30 million, or 17.4 percent,
    compared to 2005, primarily from higher commissions earned from
    programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners,
    such as the Company sponsored
    Chase

Visa card.

Operating
    Expenses

Consolidated operating expenses for 2006 increased
    $1.3 billion, or 18.9 percent, compared to the
    8.8 percent increase in capacity. Historically, changes in
    operating expenses for airlines are typically driven by changes
    in capacity, or



ASMs. The following presents Southwest’s operating expenses
    per ASM for 2006 and 2005 followed by explanations of these

%

Operating expenses per ASM increased 9.3 percent to 8.80
    cents, primarily due to an increase in jet fuel prices, net of
    gains from the Company’s fuel hedging program. The
    Company’s average cost per gallon of fuel increased
    48.5 percent versus the prior year.

Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased
    .6 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase
    in average wage rates, largely offset by productivity efforts
    that enabled the Company to grow overall headcount at a rate
    less than the growth in ASMs. The Company’s headcount at
    December 31, 2006, was 2.9 percent higher than at
    December 31, 2005, despite the 8.8 percent growth in
    available seat miles. On a dollar basis, Salaries, wages and
    benefits increased $270 million, of which $197 million
    was solely wages. The $197 million increase in wages
    represented a 10.1 percent increase compared to 2005, on an
    8.8 percent increase in ASMs. Of the $197 million
    increase in wages, the majority was related to the increase in
    average wage rates.

Fuel and oil expense increased $797 million, and on a
    per-ASM basis increased 46.2 percent, net of hedging gains,
    primarily due to a significant increase in the average cost per
    gallon of jet fuel. Although the Company’s fuel hedge
    position was not as strong as the position the Company held in
    2005, the Company’s hedging program still resulted in the
    realization of $675 million in cash settlements during
    2006. These settlements resulted in a 2006 reduction to Fuel and
    oil expense of $634 million. However, even with this hedge
    position, the Company’s jet fuel cost per gallon increased
    48.5 percent versus 2005. The average cost per gallon of
    jet fuel in 2006 was $1.53 compared to $1.03 in 2005, excluding
    fuel-related taxes and net of hedging gains. See Note 10 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in fuel
    prices was partially offset by steps the Company has taken to
    improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft, including the
    addition of blended winglets to all of the Company’s

737-700

aircraft.

On an absolute dollar basis, maintenance materials and repairs
    expense increased $22 million, primarily due to an increase
    in the number of aircraft engine repairs. However, on a per-ASM
    basis, maintenance materials and repairs decreased
    1.9 percent compared to 2005, as the dollar increase was
    only 4.9 percent versus the capacity (ASM) increase of
    8.8 percent.

Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 10.5 percent. The
    Company’s 8.8 percent increase in ASMs was generated
    by the 36 aircraft the Company acquired during 2006, all of
    which were purchased. The number of aircraft on operating lease
    remained the same, thereby reducing the percentage of these
    aircraft in the total fleet. On an absolute dollar basis,
    expense decreased $5 million due to the renegotiation of
    some aircraft leases at lower rates.

Landing fees and other rentals per ASM was flat compared to
    2005. On a dollar basis, expense increased $41 million,
    primarily due to the Company’s increase in airport space to
    support additional flight activity.

Depreciation and amortization expense per ASM increased
    1.8 percent, and on a dollar basis increased
    $46 million. These increases were primarily due to an
    increase in depreciation expense per ASM from 36 new

737-700

aircraft purchased during 2006 and the resulting higher
    percentage of owned aircraft.

In absolute dollars, Other operating expenses increased
    $122 million, of which $39 million related to credit
    card processing fees. The $39 million increase in credit
    card processing fees represented a 22.2 percent increase
    from 2005 compared to the Company’s 20.2 percent
    increase in Passenger revenues. In excess of 97 percent of
    Passenger revenues are booked via customer credit cards,
    resulting in a close correlation between these two measures. The
    second



and third largest increases in Other operating expenses on an
    absolute dollar basis were in Fuel taxes ($18 million, or
    14.0 percent, primarily due to a 15.0 percent increase
    in the unhedged cost of jet fuel per gallon and a
    7.9 percent increase in gallons consumed), and Personnel
    expenses ($16 million, or 11.9 percent, primarily
    representing hotel and per diem costs for Pilots and Flight
    Attendants, primarily due to a 6.2 percent increase in
    trips flown). Other operating expenses per ASM increased
    1.4 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to the increase
    in revenue-related costs, such as credit card processing fees,
    related to the Company’s 20.2 percent increase in
    Passenger revenues.

Other

“Other expenses (income)” included interest expense,
    capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and
    losses. Interest expense increased by $6 million, or
    4.9 percent, primarily due to an increase in floating
    interest rates. This was partially offset by the Company’s
    repayment during 2006 of $607 million in debt. The majority
    of the Company’s long-term debt is at floating rates. In
    addition, the Company issued $300 million in senior
    unsecured notes during December 2006. See Note 7 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
    Capitalized interest increased $12 million, or
    30.8 percent, compared to 2005, due to higher 2006 progress
    payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries as
    well as higher interest rates. Interest income increased
    $37 million, or 78.7 percent, primarily due to an
    increase in rates earned on cash and investments.

Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded
    in accordance with the Company’s hedging activities and
    SFAS 133. During 2006, the Company recorded losses related
    to the ineffectiveness of its hedges as well as the decrease in
    market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to
    market because they didn’t qualify for SFAS 133 hedge
    accounting. The losses resulted from the decrease in the fair
    value of the Company’s portfolio of fuel derivative
    instruments as commodity prices declined during the year. During
    2005, the Company recorded significant gains related to the
    ineffectiveness of its hedges as well as the increase in market
    value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market
    because they didn’t qualify for SFAS 133 hedge
    accounting, as commodity prices increased during that year. The

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before
    taxes, decreased to 36.8 percent in 2006 from
    37.9 percent in 2005. The decrease in the 2006 rate was due
    primarily to a $9 million net reduction related to a
    revision in the State of Texas franchise tax law enacted during
    2006.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.8 billion
    in 2007 compared to $1.4 billion in 2006. For the Company,
    operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air
    transportation for Customers. The vast majority of tickets are
    purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and, in
    some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date.
    Operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring
    expenses of operating the airline. The operating cash flows in
    both 2007 and 2006 were also significantly impacted by
    fluctuations in counterparty deposits associated with the
    Company’s fuel hedging program (counterparty deposits are
    reflected as an increase to Cash and a corresponding increase to
    Accrued liabilities). There was an increase in counterparty
    deposits of $1.5 billion for 2007, versus a decrease of
    $410 million during 2006. The increase in these deposits
    during 2007 was due to the significant increase in fair value of
    the Company’s fuel derivative portfolio from
    December 31, 2006, to December 31, 2007. The decrease
    during 2006 was due primarily to a decrease in the fair value of
    the Company’s fuel derivative instruments, as a result of a
    decline in energy commodity



prices during 2006. Cash flows associated with purchasing

and/or

selling derivatives are also classified as operating cash flows,
    although these amounts were not material for 2007 or 2006. Cash
    flows from operating activities for 2007 were also driven by the
    $645 million in net income, plus noncash depreciation and
    amortization expense of $555 million. For further
    information on the Company’s hedging program and
    counterparty deposits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, and Item 7A. Qualitative and
    Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk, respectively. Cash
    generated in 2007 and in 2006 was used primarily to finance
    aircraft-related capital expenditures and to provide working
    capital.

Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2007 totaled
    $1.5 billion, approximately the same as in 2006. Investing
    activities in both years primarily consisted of payments for new

737-700

aircraft delivered to the Company and progress payments for
    future aircraft deliveries. The Company purchased 37 new

737-700

aircraft in 2007 (the remaining two

737-700s

added to the fleet during 2007 were leased) versus the purchase
    of 36

737-700s

in
    2006. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
    Investing activities for 2007 were also reduced by
    $198 million related to a change in the balance of the
    Company’s short-term investments, namely auction rate
    securities.

Net cash used in financing activities was $493 million in
    2007, primarily from the repurchase of $1.0 billion of
    common stock. The Company repurchased a total of 66 million
    shares of outstanding common stock during 2007 as a result of
    buyback programs authorized by the Company’s Board of
    Directors. These uses were partially offset by the October 2007
    issuance of $500 million Pass Through Certificates
    consisting of $412 million 6.15% Series A certificates
    and $88 million 6.65% Series B certificates. Net cash
    used in financing activities was $801 million in 2006,
    primarily from the repurchase of $800 million of common
    stock and the repayment of $607 million in debt. The
    Company repurchased a total of 49 million shares of
    outstanding common stock during 2006 as a result of three
    buyback programs authorized by the Company’s Board of
    Directors. These uses were partially offset by the issuance of
    $300 million senior unsecured 5.75% notes in December
    2006 and $260 million in proceeds from exercises of
    Employee stock options. See Note 7 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for more information on the issuance and
    redemption of long-term debt.

The Company has various options available to meet its 2008
    capital and operating commitments, including cash on hand and
    short-term investments at December 31, 2007, totaling
    $2.8 billion, internally generated funds, and a
    $600 million bank revolving line of credit. In addition,
    the Company will also consider various borrowing or leasing
    options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements.
    The Company believes it has access to a wide variety of
    financing arrangements because of its excellent credit ratings,
    unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and consistent
    profitability. The Company currently has outstanding shelf
    registrations for the issuance of up to $540 million in
    public debt securities and pass through certificates, which it
    may utilize for aircraft financings or other purposes in the
    future.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, and Contingent
    Liabilities and Commitments

Southwest has contractual obligations and commitments primarily
    with regard to future purchases of aircraft, payment of debt,
    and lease arrangements. The Company received 39 Boeing

737-700

aircraft in 2007 — 37 of which were new aircraft from
    Boeing, and two of which were pre-owned and leased from a third
    party. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had exercised
    all remaining options for aircraft to be delivered in 2008, and
    had firm orders for 29

737-700

aircraft in 2008, 20 in 2009, 10 each in

2010-2012,

and 29 thereafter. The Company also had options for 8

737-700

aircraft in 2009, 24 in 2010, 22 in 2011 and 30 in 2012.
    Southwest also has an additional 54 purchase rights for

737-700

aircraft for the years 2008 through 2014. The Company has the
    option to substitute

737-600s

or
    -800s for the -700s. This option is applicable to aircraft
    ordered from Boeing and must be exercised 18 months prior
    to the contractual delivery date.

The leasing of aircraft effectively provides flexibility to the
    Company as a source of financing. Although the Company is
    responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and expense
    associated with operating the aircraft, and retains the risk of
    loss for leased aircraft, it has not made any guarantees to the
    lessors regarding the residual value (or market value) of the
    aircraft at the end of the lease terms. The Company operates 95
    leased aircraft, of which 86 are operating leases. As prescribed
    by GAAP, assets and obligations under operating leases are not
    included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
    Disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the
    Company’s leased aircraft is included below as well as in
    Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company is required to provide standby letters of credit to
    support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. Although the letters of credit



are an off-balance sheet item, the majority of obligations to
    which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding letters of credit
    totaled $211 million at December 31, 2007.

The following table aggregates the Company’s material
    expected contractual obligations and commitments as of
    December 31, 2007:

There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit

    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the
    Company’s revolving credit facility.

In January 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the
    Company’s common stock, utilizing present and anticipated
    proceeds from the exercise of Employee stock options.
    Repurchases were made in accordance with applicable securities
    laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to
    time, depending on market conditions. This program was completed
    during first quarter 2005, resulting in the total repurchase of
    approximately 21 million of the Company’s common
    shares.

In 2006 and 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized five separate programs for the repurchase of up to a
    total of $1.8 billion of the Company’s Common
    Stock — $300 million authorized in January 2006,
    $300 million authorized in May 2006, $400 million
    authorized in November 2006, $300 million authorized in
    March 2007, and $500 million authorized in May 2007.
    Repurchases were made in accordance with applicable securities
    laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to
    time, depending on market conditions. These programs, the last
    of which was completed during third quarter 2007, resulted in
    the repurchase of a total of approximately 116 million
    shares.

During January 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized an additional program for the repurchase of up to
    $500 million of the Company’s Common Stock.
    Repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable
    securities laws in the open market or in private transactions
    from time to time, depending on market conditions.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been
    prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Company’s significant
    accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company’s
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and
    accompanying footnotes. The Company’s estimates and
    assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in
    the business environment. However, actual results may differ
    from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially.
    Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those
    that are both most important to the portrayal of the
    Company’s financial condition and results and require
    management’s most subjective judgments. The Company’s
    most critical accounting policies and estimates are described
    below.



Revenue
    Recognition

As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially
    deferred as “Air traffic liability.” Passenger revenue
    is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the
    service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place).
    “Air traffic liability” represents tickets sold for
    future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges
    of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in “Air
    traffic liability” fluctuates throughout the year based on
    seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. The
    Company’s “Air traffic liability” balance at
    December 31, 2007 was $931 million, compared to
    $799 million as of December 31, 2006.

Estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded,
    exchanged, or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and
    judgment. The majority of the Company’s tickets sold are
    nonrefundable, which is the primary source of forfeited tickets.
    According to the Company’s “Contract of
    Carriage”, tickets (whether refundable or nonrefundable)
    that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for
    another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or can be
    refunded (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of
    tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused. Fully refundable
    tickets are rarely forfeited. “Air traffic liability”
    includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and
    exchanges, net of forfeitures, for all unused tickets once the
    flight date has passed. These estimates are based on historical
    experience over many years. The Company and members of the
    airline industry have consistently applied this accounting
    method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of
    travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the
    air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on
    subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy
    of the Company’s estimates with respect to forfeited
    tickets. Holding other factors constant, a ten-percent change in
    the Company’s estimate of the amount of refunded,
    exchanged, or forfeited tickets for 2007 would have resulted in
    a $20 million, or .2%, change in Passenger revenues
    recognized for that period.

Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale
    activity or historical Customer travel patterns can result in
    actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeited tickets differing
    significantly from estimates. The Company evaluates its
    estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts. If actual
    refunds, exchanges, or forfeiture experience results in an
    amount outside of this range, estimates and assumptions are
    reviewed and adjustments to “Air traffic liability”
    and to “Passenger revenue” are recorded, as necessary.
    Additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and
    exchanges include, but may not be limited to, the Company’s
    refund and exchange policy, the mix of refundable and
    nonrefundable fares, and promotional fare activity. The
    Company’s estimation techniques have been consistently
    applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates,
    actual refund, exchange, and forfeiture activity may vary from
    estimated amounts. No material adjustments were recorded for
    years 2005, 2006, or 2007.

The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different
    estimates for future refunds, exchanges, and forfeited tickets
    would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or
    conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other
    data available at the time estimates were made.

Accounting
    for Long-Lived Assets

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately
    $15.2 billion (at cost) of long-lived assets, including
    $13.0 billion (at cost) in flight equipment and related
    assets. Flight equipment primarily relates to the 434 Boeing 737
    aircraft in the Company’s fleet at December 31, 2007,
    which are either owned or on capital lease. The remaining 86
    Boeing 737 aircraft in the Company’s fleet at
    December 31, 2007, are on operating lease. In accounting
    for long-lived assets, the Company must make estimates about the
    expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual
    values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on
    the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate.

The following table shows a breakdown of the Company’s
    long-lived asset groups along with information about estimated
    useful lives and residual values of these groups:

Estimated

Residual

Estimated Useful Life

value

Aircraft and engines

23 to 25 years

15%

Aircraft parts

Fleet life

4%

Ground property and equipment

5 to 30 years

0%-10%

Leasehold improvements

5 years or lease term

0%

In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its
    aircraft, the Company primarily has relied upon actual
    experience with the same or similar aircraft types and
    recommendations from Boeing. Aircraft estimated useful lives are
    based on the number of “cycles” flown (one take-off
    and landing). The Company has made a conversion of cycles into
    years based on both its historical and anticipated future
    utilization of the aircraft.



Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be
    significant, could be caused by changes to the Company’s
    maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft
    (actual cycles during a given period of time), governmental
    regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new
    and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Company
    evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period
    and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions.
    Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective
    basis through depreciation and amortization expense, as required
    by GAAP.

When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets
    for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment
    may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in
    the market value of the long-lived asset(s), a significant
    change in the long-lived asset’s physical condition, and
    operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the
    long-lived asset. While the airline industry as a whole has
    experienced many of these indicators, Southwest has continued to
    operate all of its aircraft, generate positive cash flow, and
    produce profits. Consequently, the Company has not identified
    any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The
    Company will continue to monitor its long-lived assets and the
    airline operating environment.

The Company believes it unlikely that materially different
    estimates for expected lives, expected residual values, and
    impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other
    reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual
    historical experience and other data available at the time
    estimates were made.

Financial
    Derivative Instruments

The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily
    to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices, and
    accounts for them under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended
    (SFAS 133). See “Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures about Market Risk” for more information on
    these risk management activities and see Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on
    SFAS 133, the Company’s fuel hedging program, and
    financial derivative instruments.

SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be reflected at
    market (fair value) and recorded on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet. At December 31, 2007, the Company was a party to
    over 346 financial derivative instruments, related to its fuel
    hedging program, for year 2008 and beyond. The fair value of the
    Company’s fuel hedging financial derivative instruments
    recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    December 31, 2007, was $2.4 billion, compared to
    $999 million at December 31, 2006. The large increase
    in fair value was due primarily to the significant increase in
    energy prices in the second half of 2007, net of the expiration
    (i.e., settlement) of approximately $727 million in fuel
    derivative instruments that related to 2007 and net of new
    derivative instruments the Company added for future years. Of
    the remaining $2.4 billion in fair value of fuel hedging
    financial derivative instruments at December 31, 2007,
    approximately $1.1 billion is expected to settle, or expire
    during 2008. Changes in the fair values of these instruments can
    vary dramatically, as was evident during recent years, based on
    changes in the underlying commodity prices. Market price changes
    can be driven by factors such as supply and demand, inventory
    levels, weather events, refinery capacity, political agendas,
    and general economic conditions, among other items. The
    financial derivative instruments utilized by the Company
    primarily are a combination of collars, purchased call options,
    and fixed price swap agreements. The Company does not purchase
    or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes.

The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with
    third party institutions in “over-the-counter”
    markets. Since the majority of the Company’s financial
    derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the
    Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of
    instrument, the values are determined by the use of present
    value methods or standard option value models with assumptions
    about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying
    markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for
    jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet
    fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging
    instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required
    by SFAS 133. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through
    the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as
    crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline) and adjusted
    based on variations of those like commodities to the
    Company’s ultimate expected price to be paid for jet fuel
    at the specific locations in which the Company hedges.

Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet
    fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the
    financial derivative instruments settle, and the time that jet
    fuel is purchased and consumed, respectively. However, once
    settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and
    the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and
    prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements.
    In recent years,



because of increased volatility in energy markets, the
    Company’s estimates of the presumed effectiveness of its
    hedges made at the time the hedges were initially designated
    have materially differed from actual results, resulting in
    increased volatility in the Company’s periodic financial
    results. For example, historical data had been utilized in
    qualifying unleaded gasoline for SFAS 133 hedge accounting
    under the presumption that derivatives of such commodity would
    result in effective hedges, as defined. This historical data is
    updated every quarterly reporting period to ascertain whether
    SFAS 133 hedge accounting is allowed for every commodity
    the Company uses in its hedging program. During 2006, based on
    these updates, the Company in fact lost SFAS 133 hedge
    accounting for all unleaded gasoline derivative instruments, and
    thus has marked all such derivatives to market value in each
    subsequent quarterly period since that time, with all changes in
    value reflected as a component of Other gains/losses in the
    Consolidated Statement of Income. Although commodities such as
    crude oil and heating oil have continued to qualify for hedge
    accounting in most cases, there have been instances in which the
    Company has also lost hedge accounting in specific geographic
    locations for these commodities. In these instances, the Company
    has also marked such derivatives to market value with changes
    reflected in the income statement each reporting period.
    Although the Company’s prospective assessment has been
    utilized to ensure that crude oil and heating oil in most cases
    still qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting in specific
    locations where the Company hedges, there are no assurances that
    these commodities will continue to qualify in the future. This
    is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined
    products may not be consistent with historical price changes. If
    recent volatility in these commodity markets continues for an
    extended period of time or worsens in the near future, the
    Company could lose hedge accounting altogether for all crude oil
    and heating oil derivatives, which would create further
    volatility in the Company’s financial results.

Estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments
    and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in
    their values from period to period and thus determine how they
    are accounted for under SFAS 133. To the extent that the
    change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative
    instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the
    associated jet fuel to be purchased, both on a cumulative and a
    period-to-period basis, ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can
    result, as defined by SFAS 133. This could result in the
    immediate recording of noncash charges or income, representing
    the change in the fair value of the derivative, even though the
    derivative instrument may not expire/settle until a future
    period. Likewise, if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for
    hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the
    derivative instrument is recorded every period to “Other
    gains and losses” in the income statement in the period of
    the change.

Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative
    positions based in other crude oil related commodities,
    especially given the magnitude of the current fair market value
    of the Company’s fuel derivatives and the recent volatility
    in the prices of refined products. Due to the volatility in
    markets for crude oil and related products, the Company is
    unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period,
    including the loss of hedge accounting, which could be
    determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the
    aggregate for a specific commodity. This may result, and has
    resulted, in increased volatility in the Company’s
    financial statements. The significant increase in the amount of
    hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the
    change in value of derivative contracts settling in future
    periods recorded during recent periods has been due to a number
    of factors. These factors include: the significant fluctuation
    in energy prices, the number of derivative positions the Company
    holds, significant weather events that have affected refinery
    capacity and the production of refined products, and the
    volatility of the different types of products the Company uses
    for protection. The number of instances in which the Company has
    discontinued hedge accounting for specific hedges and for
    specific refined products, such as unleaded gasoline, has
    increased recently, primarily due to these reasons. In these
    cases, the Company has determined the hedges will not regain
    effectiveness in the time period remaining until settlement and
    therefore must discontinue special hedge accounting, as defined
    by SFAS 133. When this happens, any changes in fair value
    of the derivative instruments are marked to market through
    earnings in the period of change. As the fair value of the
    Company’s hedge positions can fluctuate significantly in
    amount from period to period, it is probable there will be
    continued variability recorded in the income statement and that
    the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or
    losses recorded in future periods will be material. This is
    primarily because small differences in the correlation of crude
    oil related products are leveraged over large dollar volumes.

SFAS 133 is a complex accounting standard with stringent
    requirements, including the documentation of a Company hedging
    strategy, statistical analysis to qualify a commodity for hedge
    accounting both on a historical and a prospective basis, and
    strict contemporaneous



documentation that is required at the time each hedge is
    designated by the Company. As required by SFAS 133, the
    Company assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual
    hedges on a quarterly basis. The Company also examines the
    effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis
    utilizing statistical analysis. This analysis involves utilizing
    regression and other statistical analyses that compare changes
    in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the
    commodities used for hedging purposes.

The Company continually looks for better and more accurate
    methodologies in forecasting future cash flows relating to its
    jet fuel hedging program. These estimates are an important
    component used in the measurement of effectiveness for the
    Company’s fuel hedges, as required by SFAS 133. During
    first quarter 2006, the Company did revise its method for
    forecasting these future cash flows. Prior to 2006, the Company
    had estimated future cash flows using actual market forward
    prices of a single like commodity and adjusting for historical
    differences from the Company’s actual jet fuel purchase
    prices. The Company implemented an improved model for
    forecasting forward jet fuel prices during 2006, due to the fact
    that different types of commodities are statistically better
    predictors of forward jet fuel prices, depending on specific
    geographic locations in which the Company hedges. In accordance
    with SFAS 133, the Company then adjusts for certain items,
    such as transportation costs, that are stated in fuel purchasing
    contracts with its vendors, in order to estimate the actual
    price paid for jet fuel associated with each hedge. This
    improved methodology for estimating future cash flows (i.e., jet
    fuel prices) was applied prospectively, in accordance with the
    Company’s interpretation of SFAS 133. The Company did
    not, however, change its method for either assessing or
    measuring hedge ineffectiveness. As a result of this new method
    for forecasting future jet fuel prices, the Company believes its
    hedges are more likely to be effective over the long-term.

The Company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in
    the form of interest rate swap agreements. The primary objective
    for the Company’s use of interest rate hedges is to reduce
    the volatility of net interest income by better matching the
    repricing of its assets and liabilities. The Company currently
    holds interest rate swap agreements related to its
    $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, its
    $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014,
    its $300 million 5.125% senior unsecured notes due
    2017, and its $100 million 7.375% senior unsecured
    debentures due 2027. The interest rate swaps associated with the
    $300 million 5.125% notes and $100 million
    7.375% debentures were entered into during 2007.

The floating rate paid under the swap associated with the
    $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012 is
    set in arrears. The Company pays the London InterBank Offered
    Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin every six months and receives
    6.5 percent every six months on a notional amount of
    $385 million until 2012. The average floating rate paid
    under this agreement during 2007 is estimated to be
    7.31 percent based on actual and forward rates at
    December 31, 2007. The floating rate for the swap agreement
    relating to its $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured
    notes due 2014 is set at the beginning of each six month period.
    Under this agreement, the Company pays LIBOR plus a margin every
    six months and receives 5.25 percent every six months on a
    notional amount of $350 million until 2014. The average
    floating rate paid under this agreement during 2007 was
    6.02 percent. For both the swap agreements associated with
    the $300 million 5.125% notes and $100 million
    7.375% debentures, the Company pays the LIBOR plus a margin
    every six months on the notional amount of the debt, and
    receives the fixed stated rate of the notes or debentures every
    six months until the date the notes or debentures become due.
    The average floating rate paid during 2007 under the agreement
    associated with the $300 million 5.125% notes due 2016
    was 4.64 percent. The average floating rate paid during
    2007 under the agreement associated with the $100 million
    7.375% debentures due 2027 was 6.73 percent.

The Company’s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair
    value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. In addition, these
    interest rate swap agreements qualify for the
    “shortcut” method of accounting for hedges, as defined
    by SFAS 133. Under the “shortcut” method, the
    hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective, and, thus, there
    is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings. The fair
    values of the interest rate swap agreements, which are adjusted
    regularly, is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as
    necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value
    of the long-term debt. The total fair value of the interest rate
    swap agreements, excluding accrued interest, at
    December 31, 2007, was an asset of approximately
    $16 million. The total fair value of the swap agreements
    held at December 31, 2006, was a liability of
    $30 million. The long-term portion of these amounts is
    recorded in “Other deferred liabilities” in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet for each respective year. In
    accordance with fair value hedging, the offsetting entry is an
    adjustment to decrease the carrying value of long-term debt. See
    Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different
    estimates for the fair value of financial derivative
    instruments, and forward jet fuel prices, would be made or
    reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions
    suggested by actual historical experience and other data
    available at the time estimates were made.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company has share-based compensation plans covering the
    majority of its Employee groups, including plans adopted via
    collective bargaining, a plan covering the Company’s Board
    of Directors, and plans related to employment contracts with the
    Executive Chairman of the Company. Prior to January 1,
    2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation
    utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the
    provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
    (APB 25), “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
    and related Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation
    expense was recognized for fixed option plans because the
    exercise prices of Employee stock options equaled or exceeded
    the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant.
    However, prior to adoption of SFAS 123R, share-based
    compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the
    financial statement footnotes for periods prior to 2006.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment” using the modified retrospective
    transition method. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates
    the use of APB 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting,
    and requires companies to recognize the cost of Employee
    services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments,
    based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the
    financial statements.

Under the modified retrospective method, compensation cost is
    recognized in the financial statements beginning with the
    effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for
    all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on
    the requirements of SFAS 123 for all unvested awards
    granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R. In
    addition, results for prior periods were retroactively adjusted
    utilizing the pro forma disclosures in those prior financial
    statements. As part of this revision, the Company recorded
    cumulative share-based compensation expense of $409 million
    for the period

1995-2005,

resulting in a reduction to Retained earnings in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. This
    adjustment, along with the creation of a net Deferred
    income tax asset in the amount of $130 million, resulted in
    an offsetting increase to Capital in excess of par value in the
    amount of $539 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
    of December 31, 2005. The Deferred tax asset represents the
    portion of the cumulative expense related to stock options that
    will result in a future tax deduction.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on
    the date of grant utilizing a modified Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
    developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term
    traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
    transferable. However, certain assumptions used in the
    Black-Scholes model, such as expected term, can be adjusted to
    incorporate the unique characteristics of the Company’s
    stock option awards. Option valuation models require the input
    of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock
    price volatility and expected term. For 2006 and 2007, the
    Company has relied on observations of historical volatility
    trends, implied future volatility observations as determined by
    independent third parties, and implied volatility from traded
    options on the Company’s stock. For both 2007 and 2006
    stock option grants, the Company utilized expected volatility
    based on the expected life of the option, but within a range of
    24 percent to 27 percent. Prior to 2005, the Company
    relied exclusively on historical volatility as an input for
    determining the estimated fair value of stock options. In
    determining the expected term of the option grants, the Company
    has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar
    characteristics, the actual vesting schedule of the grant, and
    assessed the expected risk tolerance of different optionee
    groups.

Other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the
    Black-Scholes model are the expected risk-free interest rate and
    expected dividend yield of the Company’s stock. The
    risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury
    zero-coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the
    option on the date of grant. The expected dividend yield of the
    Company’s common stock over the expected term of the option
    on the date of grant was estimated based on the Company’s
    current dividend yield, and adjusted for anticipated future
    changes.

Vesting terms for the Company’s stock option plans differ
    based on the type of grant made and the group to which the
    options are granted. For grants made to Employees under
    collective bargaining plans, vesting has ranged in length from
    immediate vesting to vesting periods in accordance with the
    period covered by the respective collective bargaining
    agreement. For “Other Employee Plans,” options
    generally vest and become fully exercisable over three, five, or
    ten years of continued



employment, depending upon the grant type. For grants in any of
    the Company’s plans that are subject to graded vesting over
    a service period, the Company recognizes expense on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
    entire award. None of the Company’s grants include
    performance-based or market-based vesting conditions, as defined.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $37 million
    in remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to past
    grants of stock options, which is expected to be recognized over
    a weighted-average period of 2.25 years. The total
    recognition period for the remaining unrecognized compensation
    cost was approximately eight years; however, the majority of
    this cost will be recognized over the next two years, in
    accordance with vesting provisions. The majority of the $37
    million in share-based compensation expense reflected in the
    Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, was related to options granted prior to
    the adoption of SFAS 123R. Based on Employee stock options
    expected to vest during 2008, and the Company’s expectation
    of future grants, the Company expects the expense related to
    share-based compensation to once again decrease during 2008
    compared to 2007 expense.

The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different
    estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value
    of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions
    suggested by actual historical experience and other data
    available at the time estimates were made.

Recent
    Accounting Developments

In September 2006, the FASB issued statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”

,

(SFAS 157).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. The Company is subject to the
    provisions of SFAS 157 beginning January 1, 2008. The
    Company has not yet determined whether SFAS 157 will have a
    material impact on its financial condition, results of
    operations, or cash flow. However, the Company believes it will
    likely be required to provide additional disclosures as part of
    future financial statements, beginning with first quarter 2008.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (Statement 159). Statement 159 allows entities
    the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair
    value as of specified dates. Such election, which may be applied
    on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable
    once elected. Statement 159 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not
    believe Statement 159 will result in a material adverse effect
    on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt
    obligations and interest rate swaps, and has commodity price
    risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet. The
    Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but
    seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented
    hedging strategy. Southwest has market sensitive instruments in
    the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative
    instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price
    increases. The Company also operates 95 aircraft under operating
    and capital leases. However, leases are not considered market
    sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included
    in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments
    related to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase
    or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading
    purposes. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for information on the Company’s accounting for
    its hedging program and for further details on the
    Company’s financial derivative instruments.

Fuel
    Hedging

The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments, on both a
    short-term and a long-term basis, as a form of insurance against
    significant increases in fuel prices. The Company believes there
    is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of
    such fuel price increases. The Company expects to consume
    approximately 1.5 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2008.
    Based on this usage, a change in jet fuel prices of just one
    cent per gallon would impact the Company’s “Fuel and
    oil expense” by approximately $15 million per year,
    excluding any impact of the Company’s derivative
    instruments.

The fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments
    related to the Company’s jet fuel market price risk at
    December 31, 2007, were net assets of $2.4 billion.
    The current portion of these financial derivative instruments,
    or $1.1 billion, is classified as “Fuel derivative
    contracts” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The long-term
    portion of these financial derivative instruments, or
    $1.3 billion, is included in “Other assets.”



The fair values of the derivative instruments, depending on the
    type of instrument, were determined by use of present value
    methods or standard option value models with assumptions about
    commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets.
    An immediate ten-percent increase or decrease in underlying
    fuel-related commodity prices from the December 31, 2007,
    prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the
    commodity derivative instruments in place by up to
    $658 million. Changes in the related commodity derivative
    instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this
    amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well
    as related income tax effects. This sensitivity analysis uses
    industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant
    at December 31, 2007, levels, except underlying futures
    prices.

Outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the Company
    to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
    counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not
    expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet its
    obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial
    instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a
    positive fair value at the reporting date. To manage credit
    risk, the Company selects and will periodically review
    counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a
    single counterparty, and monitors the market position of the
    program and its relative market position with each counterparty.
    At December 31, 2007, the Company had agreements with nine
    counterparties containing early termination rights

and/or

bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if
    market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or
    credit ratings fall below certain levels. At December 31,
    2007, the Company held $2.0 billion in cash collateral
    deposits under these bilateral collateral provisions. These
    collateral deposits serve to decrease, but not totally
    eliminate, the credit risk associated with the Company’s
    hedging program. The deposits are included in “Accrued
    liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See also
    Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial
    Market Risk

The vast majority of the Company’s assets are aircraft,
    which are long-lived. The Company’s strategy is to maintain
    a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and
    profitably. While the Company uses financial leverage, it has
    maintained a strong balance sheet and an “A” credit
    rating on its senior unsecured fixed-rate debt with
    Standard & Poor’s and Fitch ratings agencies, and
    a “Baa1” credit rating with Moody’s rating agency
    as of December 31, 2007. In January 2008, Fitch announced a
    cut in the Company’s senior unsecured debt rating to
    “A−”. The Company’s 1999 and 2004 French
    Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value
    risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these
    borrowings are floating-rate debt. In addition, as disclosed in
    Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
    Company has converted certain of its long-term debt to floating
    rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements. This
    includes the Company’s $385 million 6.5% senior
    unsecured notes due 2012, the $350 million
    5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014, the
    $300 million 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017,
    and the $100 million 7.375% senior unsecured
    debentures due 2027. Although there is interest rate risk
    associated with these floating rate borrowings, the risk for the
    1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements is somewhat mitigated by
    the fact that the Company may prepay this debt under certain
    conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for more information on the material terms of the
    Company’s short-term and long-term debt.

Excluding the notes or debentures that were converted to a
    floating rate as previously noted, the Company’s only
    fixed-rate senior unsecured notes at December 31, 2007 were
    its $300 million notes due 2016. These senior unsecured
    notes have a fixed-rate of 5.75 percent, which is
    comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt
    instruments over the last ten years. The Company’s
    outstanding $500 million EETCs, which are secured by 16
    Boeing

737-700

aircraft, had an effective fixed-rate of 6.24 percent. The
    carrying value of the Company’s floating rate debt totaled
    $1.3 billion, and this debt had a weighted-average maturity
    of 6.1 years at floating rates averaging 5.68 percent
    for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. In total,
    the Company’s fixed rate debt and floating rate debt
    represented 6.5 percent and 10.3 percent,
    respectively, of total noncurrent assets at December 31,
    2007.

The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest
    rates due to the short-term nature of its invested cash, which
    totaled $2.2 billion, and short-term investments, which
    totaled $566 million, at December 31, 2007. However,
    the Company generally does not retain the interest earnings on
    the $2.0 billion in cash collateral deposits from
    counterparties associated with the Company’s fuel
    derivative instruments. See Notes 1 and 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The
    Company invests available cash in certificates of deposit,
    highly rated money market instruments, investment grade
    commercial paper, auction rate securities, and other highly
    rated financial instruments. Because of the short-term nature of
    these investments, the returns earned parallel closely with
    short-term floating interest



rates. The Company has not undertaken any additional actions to
    cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other
    material market interest rate risk management activities.

A hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of
    December 31, 2007, would not have a material affect on the
    fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt instruments.
    See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information on the fair value of the Company’s
    financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could,
    however, have a corresponding effect on the Company’s
    earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt,
    invested cash (excluding cash collateral deposits), and
    short-term investments because of the floating-rate nature of
    these items. Assuming floating market rates in effect as of
    December 31, 2007, were held constant throughout a

12-month

period, a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would
    correspondingly change the Company’s net earnings and cash
    flows associated with these items by less than $3 million.
    Utilizing these assumptions and considering the Company’s
    cash balance (excluding cash collateral deposits), short-term
    investments, and floating-rate debt outstanding at
    December 31, 2007, an increase in rates would have a net
    positive effect on the Company’s earnings and cash flows,
    while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on
    the Company’s earnings and cash flows. However, a ten
    percent change in market rates would not impact the
    Company’s earnings or cash flow associated with the
    Company’s publicly traded fixed-rate debt.

The Company is also subject to various financial covenants
    included in its credit card transaction processing agreement,
    the revolving credit facility, and outstanding debt agreements.
    Covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings. For
    the revolving credit facility, the Company must also maintain,
    at all times, a Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of
    not less than 1.00 to 1.25. The Company met or exceeded the
    minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of
    December 31, 2007. However, if conditions change and the
    Company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the
    agreements, it could reduce the availability of cash under the
    agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact
    as written.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2007

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
    of Presentation

Southwest Airlines Co. (the Company or Southwest) is a major
    domestic airline that provides point-to-point, low-fare service.
    The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    Southwest and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The
    preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these
    estimates.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash in excess of that necessary for operating requirements is
    invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing
    investments. Investments with maturities of three months or less
    are classified as cash and cash equivalents, which primarily
    consist of certificates of deposit, money market funds, and
    investment grade commercial paper issued by major corporations
    and financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents are stated
    at cost, which approximates market value.

Short-Term
    Investments

Short-term investments consist of auction rate securities with
    auction reset periods of less than 12 months. These
    investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and
    are stated at fair value. At each reset period, the Company
    accounts for the transaction as “Proceeds from sales of
    short-term investments” for the security relinquished, and
    a “Purchase of short-investments” for the security
    purchased, in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash
    Flows. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are recognized
    in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” in
    the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized gains and
    losses on specific investments, which totaled $17 million
    in 2007, $17 million in 2006, and $4 million in 2005,
    are reflected in “Interest income” in the accompanying
    Consolidated Income Statement.

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term
    investments as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, included
    $540 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, in
    collateral deposits received from the counterparties of the
    Company’s fuel derivative instruments. Although these
    amounts are not restricted in any way, the Company generally
    must remit the investment earnings from these amounts back to
    the counterparties. Depending on the fair value of the
    Company’s fuel derivative instruments, the amounts of
    collateral deposits held at any point in time can fluctuate
    significantly. Therefore, the Company generally excludes the
    cash collateral deposits in its decisions related to long-term
    cash planning and forecasting. See Note 10 for further
    information on these collateral deposits and fuel derivative
    instruments.

Accounts
    and Other Receivables

Accounts and other receivables are carried at cost. They
    primarily consist of amounts due from credit card companies
    associated with sales of tickets for future travel and amounts
    due from counterparties associated with fuel derivative
    instruments that have settled. The amount of allowance for
    doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007
    was immaterial. In addition, the provision for doubtful accounts
    and write-offs for 2005, 2006, and 2007 were immaterial.

Inventories

Inventories primarily consist of flight equipment expendable
    parts, materials, aircraft fuel, and supplies. All of these
    items are carried at average cost, less an allowance for
    obsolescence. These items are generally charged to expense when
    issued for use. The reserve for obsolescence was immaterial at
    December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. In addition, the
    Company’s provision for obsolescence and write-offs for
    2005, 2006, and 2007 were immaterial.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is
    provided by the straight-line method to estimated residual
    values over periods generally ranging from 23 to 25 years
    for flight equipment and 5 to 30 years for ground property
    and equipment once the asset is placed in service. Residual
    values estimated for aircraft are generally 15 percent and
    for ground property and equipment range from zero to
    10 percent. Property under capital leases and related
    obligations is recorded at an amount equal to the present value
    of future minimum lease payments computed on the basis of the
    Company’s incremental borrowing rate or, when known, the
    interest rate implicit in



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the lease. Amortization of property under capital leases is on a
    straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in
    depreciation expense.

In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its
    aircraft, the Company primarily has relied upon actual
    experience with the same or similar aircraft types,
    recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of the
    Company’s aircraft, and current fair values in markets for
    similar used aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these estimates,
    which can be significant, could be caused by changes to the
    Company’s maintenance program, modifications or
    improvements to the aircraft, changes in utilization of the
    aircraft (actual flight hours or cycles during a given period of
    time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, changing
    market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar
    types, etc. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions
    each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts these
    estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are
    accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and
    amortization expense, as required by GAAP.

When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets
    used in operations for impairment. Impairment losses would be
    recorded when events and circumstances indicate that an asset
    might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows to be
    generated by that asset are less than the carrying amounts of
    the asset. Factors that would indicate potential impairment
    include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the
    market value of the long-lived asset(s), a significant change in
    the long-lived asset’s physical condition, operating or
    cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived
    asset, etc. The Company continues to experience positive cash
    flow and operate all of its aircraft, and there have been no
    significant impairments of long-lived assets recorded during
    2005, 2006, or 2007.

Aircraft
    and Engine Maintenance

The cost of scheduled inspections and repairs and routine
    maintenance costs for all aircraft and engines are charged to
    maintenance expense as incurred. Modifications that
    significantly enhance the operating performance or extend the
    useful lives of aircraft or engines are capitalized and
    amortized over the remaining life of the asset.

Intangible
    Assets

Intangible assets primarily consist of leasehold rights to
    airport owned gates. These assets are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the lease,
    approximately 20 years. The accumulated amortization
    related to the Company’s intangible assets at
    December 31, 2007, and 2006, was $9 million and
    $5 million, respectively. The Company periodically assesses
    its intangible assets for impairment in accordance with
    SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

;
    however, no impairments have been noted.

Revenue
    Recognition

Tickets sold are initially deferred as “Air traffic
    liability”. Passenger revenue is recognized when
    transportation is provided. “Air traffic liability”
    primarily represents tickets sold for future travel dates and
    estimated refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel
    dates. The majority of the Company’s tickets sold are
    nonrefundable. Tickets that are sold but not flown on the travel
    date (whether refundable or nonrefundable) can be reused for
    another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or refunded
    (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or
    partial tickets) expire unused. The Company estimates the amount
    of future refunds and exchanges, net of forfeitures, for all
    unused tickets once the flight date has passed. These estimates
    are based on historical experience over many years. The Company
    and many members of the airline industry have consistently
    applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from
    forfeited tickets at the date travel is provided. Estimated
    future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic
    liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent
    refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the
    Company’s revenue recognition method with respect to
    forfeited tickets.

Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale
    activity or historical Customer travel patterns can result in
    actual refunds, exchanges or forfeited tickets differing
    significantly from estimates; however, these differences have
    historically not been material. Additional factors that may
    affect estimated refunds, exchanges, and forfeitures include,
    but may not be limited to, the Company’s refund and
    exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares,
    and fare sale activity. The Company’s estimation techniques
    have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as
    with any estimates, actual refund and exchange activity may vary
    from estimated amounts.

The Company is also required to collect certain taxes and fees
    from Customers on behalf of government agencies and remit these
    back to the applicable



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

governmental entity on a periodic basis. These taxes and fees
    include U.S. federal transportation taxes, federal security
    charges, and airport passenger facility charges. These items are
    collected from Customers at the time they purchase their
    tickets, but are not included in Passenger revenue. The Company
    records a liability upon collection from the Customer and
    relieves the liability when payments are remitted to the
    applicable governmental agency.

Frequent
    Flyer Program

The Company records a liability for the estimated incremental
    cost of providing free travel under its Rapid Rewards frequent
    flyer program at the time an award is earned. The estimated
    incremental cost includes direct passenger costs such as fuel,
    food, and other operational costs, but does not include any
    contribution to overhead or profit.

The Company also sells frequent flyer credits and related
    services to companies participating in its Rapid Rewards
    frequent flyer program. Funds received from the sale of flight
    segment credits are accounted for under the residual value
    method. Under this method, the Company has determined the
    portion of funds received for sale of flight segment credits
    that relate to free travel, currently estimated at
    75 percent of the amount received per flight segment credit
    sold. These amounts are deferred and recognized as
    “Passenger revenue” when the ultimate free travel
    awards are flown or the credits expire unused. The remaining 25
    percent of the amount received per flight segment credit sold,
    which is assumed not to be associated with future travel,
    includes items such as access to the Company’s frequent
    flyer program population for marketing/solicitation purposes,
    use of the Company’s logo on co-branded credit cards, and
    other trademarks, designs, images, etc. of Southwest for use in
    marketing materials. This remaining portion is recognized in
    “Other revenue” in the period earned.

Advertising

The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
    Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006, and 2005 was $191 million, $182 million, and
    $173 million, respectively.

Share-Based
    Employee Compensation

The Company has stock-based compensation plans covering the
    majority of its Employee groups, including a plan covering the
    Company’s Board of Directors and plans related to
    employment contracts with the Executive Chairman of the Company.
    The Company accounts for stock-based compensation utilizing the
    fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment.” See Note 13.

Financial
    Derivative Instruments

The Company accounts for financial derivative instruments
    utilizing Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 133 (SFAS 133), “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. The
    Company utilizes various derivative instruments, including crude
    oil, unleaded gasoline, and heating oil-based derivatives, to
    attempt to reduce the risk of its exposure to jet fuel price
    increases. These instruments primarily consist of purchased call
    options, collar structures, and fixed-price swap agreements, and
    upon proper qualification are accounted for as cash-flow hedges,
    as defined by SFAS 133. The Company has also entered into
    interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of its
    fixed-rate debt to floating rates. These interest rate hedges
    are accounted for as fair value hedges, as defined by
    SFAS 133.

Since the majority of the Company’s financial derivative
    instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the Company
    estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of
    instrument, the values are determined by the use of present
    value methods or standard option value models with assumptions
    about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying
    markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for
    jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet
    fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging
    instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required
    by SFAS 133. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through
    utilization of a statistical-based regression equation with data
    from market forward prices of like commodities. This equation is
    then adjusted for certain items, such as transportation costs,
    that are stated in the Company’s fuel purchasing contracts
    with its vendors.

For the effective portion of settled hedges, as defined in
    SFAS 133, the Company records the associated gains or
    losses as a component of Fuel and oil expense in the
    Consolidated Statement of Income. For amounts representing
    ineffectiveness, as defined, or changes in fair value of
    derivative instruments for which hedge accounting is not
    applied, the Company records any gains or losses as a component
    of Other (gains) losses, net, in the Consolidated Statement of
    Income. Amounts that are paid or



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

received associated with the purchase or sale of financial
    derivative instruments (i.e., premium costs of option contracts)
    are classified as a component of Other (gains) losses, net, in
    the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period in which the
    instrument settles or expires. All cash flows associated with
    purchasing and selling derivatives are classified as operating
    cash flows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, either
    as a component of changes in Other current assets or Other, net,
    depending on whether the derivative will settle within twelve
    months or beyond twelve months, respectively. See Note 10
    for further information on SFAS 133 and financial
    derivative instruments.

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for deferred income taxes utilizing
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109
    (SFAS 109), “Accounting for Income Taxes”, as
    amended. SFAS 109 requires an asset and liability method,
    whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based
    on the tax effects of temporary differences between the
    financial statements and the tax bases of assets and
    liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. When
    appropriate, in accordance with SFAS 109, the Company
    evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred
    tax assets.

Concentration
    Risk

A significant number of the Company’s Employees are
    unionized and are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
    The following Employee groups are under agreements that are
    currently amendable or will become amendable during 2008: the
    Company’s Pilots (became amendable in 2006, and currently
    in discussions on a new agreement); the Company’s Flight
    Attendants (becomes amendable in June 2008); the Company’s
    Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, and Freight Agents (becomes
    amendable in July 2008, and began negotiations in January 2008);
    the Company’s Stock Clerks and Mechanics (both become
    amendable in August 2008); and the Company’s Customer
    Service and Reservations Agents (becomes amendable in November
    2008.)

The Company attempts to minimize its concentration risk with
    regards to its cash, cash equivalents, and its investment
    portfolio. This is accomplished by diversifying and limiting
    amounts among different counterparties, the type of investment,
    and the amount invested in any individual security or money
    market fund.

To manage risk associated with financial derivative instruments
    held, the Company selects and will periodically review
    counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a
    single counterparty, and monitors the market position of the
    program and its relative market position with each counterparty.
    At December 31, 2007, the Company had agreements with nine
    counterparties containing early termination rights

and/or

bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if
    market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or
    credit ratings fall below certain levels. At December 31,
    2007, the Company held $2.0 billion in cash collateral
    deposits under these bilateral collateral provisions. These
    collateral deposits serve to decrease, but not totally
    eliminate, the credit risk associated with the Company’s
    hedging program.

The Company operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet of aircraft. If the
    Company was unable to acquire additional aircraft from Boeing,
    or Boeing was unable or unwilling to provide adequate support
    for its products, the Company’s operations could be
    adversely impacted. However, the Company considers its
    relationship with Boeing to be good and believes the advantages
    of operating a single fleet type outweigh the risks of such a
    strategy.

2.

Recent
    Accounting Developments

In September 2006, the FASB issued statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”

,

(SFAS 157).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. The Company is subject to the
    provisions of SFAS 157 beginning January 1, 2008. The
    Company has not yet determined whether SFAS 157 will have a
    material impact on its financial condition, results of
    operations, or cash flow. However, the Company believes it will
    likely be required to provide additional disclosures as part of
    future financial statements, beginning with first quarter 2008.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (Statement 159). Statement 159 allows entities
    the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair
    value as of specified dates. Such election, which may be applied
    on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable
    once elected. Statement 159 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not
    believe Statement 159 will result in a material adverse effect



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.

Acquisition
    of Certain Assets

In fourth quarter 2004, Southwest was selected as the winning
    bidder at a bankruptcy-court approved auction for certain ATA
    Airlines, Inc. (ATA) assets. As part of the transaction, which
    was approved in December 2004, Southwest agreed to pay
    $40 million for certain ATA assets, consisting of the
    leasehold rights to six of ATA’s leased Chicago Midway
    Airport gates and the rights to a leased aircraft maintenance
    hangar at Chicago Midway Airport. In addition, Southwest
    provided ATA with $40 million in

debtor-in-possession

financing while ATA remained in bankruptcy, and also guaranteed
    the repayment of an ATA construction loan to the City of Chicago
    for $7 million. As part of this original transaction,
    Southwest committed, upon ATA’s emergence from bankruptcy,
    to convert the

debtor-in-possession

financing to a term loan, payable over five years, and to invest
    $30 million cash in ATA convertible preferred stock.

During fourth quarter 2005, ATA Airlines, Inc. (ATA) entered
    into an agreement in which an investor, MatlinPatterson Global
    Opportunities Partners II, would provide financing to enable ATA
    to emerge from bankruptcy. As part of this transaction,
    Southwest entered into an agreement with ATA to acquire the
    leasehold rights to four additional leased gates at Chicago
    Midway Airport in exchange for a $20 million reduction in
    the Company’s

debtor-in-possession

loan. Upon ATA’s emergence from bankruptcy, which took
    place on February 28, 2006, ATA repaid the remaining
    $20 million balance of the

debtor-in-possession

financing to the Company, and provided a letter of credit to
    support Southwest’s obligation under the construction loan
    to the City of Chicago. In addition, Southwest was relieved of
    its commitment to purchase ATA convertible preferred stock.

Southwest and ATA also agreed on a code share arrangement, under
    which each carrier can exchange passengers on certain designated
    flights. This agreement was approved and implemented during
    first quarter 2005, although it has since been enhanced and
    adjusted.

Commitments

The Company’s contractual purchase commitments primarily
    consist of scheduled aircraft acquisitions from Boeing. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company had contractual purchase
    commitments with Boeing for 29

737-700

aircraft deliveries in 2008, 20 scheduled for delivery in 2009,
    10 each in 2010 thru 2012, and 29 thereafter. In addition, the
    Company has options and purchase rights for an additional 138

737-700s

that it may acquire during

2009-2014.

The Company has the option, which must be exercised
    18 months prior to the contractual delivery date, to
    substitute

737-600s

or

737-800s

for
    the

737-700s.

As
    of December 31, 2007, aggregate funding needed for firm
    commitments is approximately $3.2 billion, subject to
    adjustments for inflation, due as follows: $747 million in
    2008, $498 million in 2009, $341 million in 2010,
    $444 million in 2011, $458 million in 2012, and
    $684 million thereafter.

Revolving
    Credit Facility

The Company has a revolving credit facility under which it can
    borrow up to $600 million from a group of banks. The
    facility expires in August 2010 and is unsecured. At the
    Company’s option, interest on the facility can be
    calculated on one of several different bases. For most
    borrowings, Southwest would anticipate choosing a

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

floating rate based upon LIBOR. If the facility had been fully
    drawn at December 31, 2007, the spread over LIBOR would
    have been 62.5 basis points given Southwest’s credit
    rating at that date. The facility also contains a financial
    covenant requiring a minimum coverage ratio of adjusted pre-tax
    income to fixed obligations, as defined. As of December 31,
    2007, the Company was in compliance with this covenant, and
    there were no outstanding amounts borrowed under this facility.

On October 3, 2007, grantor trusts established by the
    Company issued $500 million Pass Through Certificates
    consisting of $412 million 6.15% Series A certificates
    and $88 million 6.65% Series B certificates. A
    separate trust was established for each class of certificates.
    The trusts used the proceeds from the sale of certificates to
    acquire equipment notes in the same amounts, which were issued
    by Southwest on a full recourse basis. Payments on the equipment
    notes held in each trust will be passed through to the holders
    of certificates of such trust. The equipment notes were issued
    for each of 16 Boeing

737-700

aircraft owned by Southwest and are secured by a mortgage on
    each aircraft. Interest on the equipment notes held for the
    certificates is payable semi-annually, beginning
    February 1, 2008. Also beginning February 1, 2008,
    principal payments on the equipment notes held for both series
    of certificates are due semi-annually until the balance of the
    certificates mature on August 1, 2022. The Company utilized
    the proceeds from the issuance of the Pass Through Certificates
    for general corporate purposes. Prior to their issuance, the
    Company also entered into swap agreements to hedge the
    variability in interest rates on the Pass Through Certificates.
    The swap agreements were accounted for as cash flow hedges, and
    resulted in a payment by the Company of $20 million upon
    issuance of the Pass Through Certificates. The effective portion
    of the hedge is being amortized to interest expense concurrent
    with the amortization of the debt and is reflected in the above
    table as a reduction in the debt balance. The ineffectiveness of
    the hedge transaction was immaterial.

During December 2006, the Company issued $300 million
    senior unsecured Notes due 2016. The notes bear interest at
    5.75 percent, payable semi-annually in arrears, with the
    first payment made on June 15, 2007. Southwest used the net
    proceeds from the issuance of the notes for general corporate
    purposes.

During February 2005, the Company issued $300 million
    senior unsecured Notes due 2017. The notes bear interest at
    5.125 percent, payable semi-annually in arrears, with the
    first payment made on September 1, 2005. Southwest used the
    net proceeds from the issuance of the notes for general
    corporate purposes. In January 2007, the Company entered into an
    interest-rate swap

agreement to convert this fixed-rate debt to a floating rate.
    See Note 10 for more information on the interest-rate swap
    agreement.

In fourth quarter 2004, the Company entered into four identical

13-year

floating-rate financing arrangements, whereby it borrowed a
    total of $112 million from French banking partnerships.
    Although the interest rates on the borrowings float, the Company
    estimates that, considering the full effect of the “net
    present value benefits” included in the transactions, the
    effective economic yield over the

13-year

term
    of the loans will be approximately LIBOR minus 45 basis
    points. Principal and interest are payable semi-annually on June
    30 and December 31 for each of the loans, and the Company may
    terminate the arrangements in any year on either of those dates,
    under certain conditions. The Company pledged four aircraft as
    collateral for the transactions.

In September 2004, the Company issued $350 million senior
    unsecured Notes due 2014. The notes bear interest at
    5.25 percent, payable semi-annually in arrears, on April 1
    and October 1. Concurrently, the Company entered into an
    interest-rate swap agreement to convert this fixed-rate debt to
    a floating rate. See Note 10 for more information on the
    interest-rate swap agreement. Southwest used the net proceeds
    from the issuance of the notes for general corporate purposes.

On March 1, 2002, the Company issued $385 million
    senior unsecured Notes due March 1, 2012. The notes bear
    interest at 6.5 percent, payable semi-annually on March 1
    and September 1. Southwest used the net proceeds from the
    issuance of the notes for general corporate purposes. During
    2003, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement
    relating to these notes. See Note 10 for further
    information.

In fourth quarter 1999, the Company entered into two identical

13-year

floating rate financing arrangements, whereby it borrowed a
    total of $56 million from French banking partnerships.
    Although the interest rates on the borrowings float, the Company
    estimates that, considering the full effect of the “net
    present value benefits” included in the transactions, the
    effective economic yield over the

13-year

term
    of the loans will be approximately LIBOR minus 67 basis
    points. Principal and interest are payable semi-annually on June
    30 and December 31 for each of the loans and the Company may
    terminate the arrangements in any year on either of those dates,
    with certain conditions. The Company pledged two aircraft as
    collateral for the transactions.

On February 28, 1997, the Company issued $100 million
    of senior unsecured


/


% Debentures
    due March 1, 2027. Interest is payable semi-annually on
    March 1 and September 1. The debentures may be redeemed, at
    the option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from
    time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of the
    principal amount of the debentures plus accrued interest at the
    date of redemption or the sum of the present values of the
    remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon,
    discounted to the date of redemption at the comparable treasury
    rate plus 20 basis points, plus accrued interest at the
    date of redemption. In January 2007, the Company entered into an
    interest-rate swap agreement to convert this fixed-rate debt to
    a floating rate. See Note 10 for more information on the
    interest-rate swap agreement.

The Company is required to provide standby letters of credit to
    support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. Although the letters of credit are an off-balance
    sheet item, the majority of obligations to which they relate are
    reflected as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
    Outstanding letters of credit totaled $211 million at
    December 31, 2007.

The net book value of the assets pledged as collateral for the
    Company’s secured borrowings, primarily aircraft and
    engines, was $660 million at December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, aggregate annual principal
    maturities of debt and capital leases (not including amounts
    associated with interest rate swap agreements and interest on
    capital leases) for the five-year period ending
    December 31, 2012, were $40 million in 2008,
    $42 million in 2009, $50 million in 2010,
    $44 million in 2011, $418 million in 2012, and
    $1.5 billion thereafter.

Project
    Early Departure

Project Early Departure was a voluntary early retirement program
    offered in July 2007 to eligible Employees, in which the Company
    offered a cash bonus of $25,000 plus medical/dental continuation
    coverage and travel privileges based on eligibility.

A total of 608 out of approximately 8,500 eligible Employees
    elected to participate in the program. The number of Employees
    from each group that accepted the package is as follows: 395
    from Reservations, 165 from Ground Operations, 41 from Inflight
    and seven from Provisioning. The participants’ last day of
    work falls between September 30, 2007 and April 30,
    2008, based on the operational needs of particular work
    locations and departments. The Company did not have a target or
    expectation for the number of Employees expected to accept the
    package.

Project Early Departure resulted in a pre-tax,
    pre-profitsharing, one-time charge of approximately
    $25 million during third quarter 2007, all of which is
    reflected in “Salaries, wages and benefits” in the
    accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income. Approximately
    $14 million remained to be paid and is recorded as an
    accrued liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet
    as of December 31, 2007. The Company will continue to
    address future staffing needs, but currently anticipates that
    the majority of the positions will be filled with
    entry-level Employees at lower wage rates to meet
    operational demands. The purpose of this voluntary initiative
    and

other initiatives is to help the Company reduce future operating
    costs.

Derivative
    and Financial Instruments

Fuel
    Contracts

Airline operators are inherently dependent upon energy to
    operate and, therefore, are impacted by changes in jet fuel
    prices. Jet fuel and oil consumed during 2007, 2006, and 2005
    represented approximately 28.0 percent, 26.2 percent,
    and 19.6 percent of Southwest’s operating expenses,
    respectively. The primary reason that fuel and oil has become an
    increasingly large portion of the Company’s operating
    expenses has been due to the dramatic increase in all energy
    prices over this period. The Company endeavors to acquire jet
    fuel at the lowest possible cost. Because jet fuel is not traded
    on an organized futures exchange, there are limited
    opportunities to hedge directly in jet fuel. However, the
    Company has found that financial derivative instruments in other
    commodities, such as crude oil, and refined products such as
    heating oil and unleaded gasoline, can be useful in decreasing
    its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company does not
    purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for
    trading purposes.

The Company has utilized financial derivative instruments for
    both short-term and long-term time frames. In addition to the
    significant protective fuel derivative positions the Company had
    in place during 2007, the Company also has significant future
    positions. The Company currently has a mixture of purchased call
    options, collar structures, and fixed price swap agreements in
    place to protect against over 70 percent of its 2008 total
    anticipated jet fuel requirements at average crude oil
    equivalent prices of approximately $51 per barrel, and has also
    added refinery margins on most of those positions. Based on
    current growth plans, the Company also has fuel derivative
    contracts in place for over 55 percent of its expected fuel
    consumption for 2009 at approximately $51 per barrel, nearly
    30 percent for 2010 at approximately $63 per barrel, over
    15 percent for 2011 at $64 per barrel, and over
    15 percent in 2012 at $63 per barrel.

Upon proper qualification, the Company endeavors to account for
    its fuel derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, as defined
    in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

, as amended (SFAS 133). Under SFAS 133,
    all derivatives designated as hedges that meet certain
    requirements are granted special hedge accounting treatment.
    Generally, utilizing the special hedge accounting, all periodic
    changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as hedges
    that are considered to be effective, as defined, are recorded in
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income” until the
    underlying jet fuel is consumed. See Note 11 for further
    information on Accumulated other comprehensive income. The
    Company is exposed to the risk that periodic changes will not be
    effective, as defined, or that the derivatives will no longer
    qualify for special hedge accounting. Ineffectiveness, as
    defined, results when the change in the fair value of the
    derivative instrument exceeds the change in the value of the
    Company’s expected future cash outlay to purchase and
    consume jet fuel. To the extent that the periodic changes in the
    fair value of the derivatives are not effective, that
    ineffectiveness is recorded to Other gains and losses in the
    income statement. Likewise, if a hedge ceases to qualify for
    hedge accounting, any change in the fair value of derivative
    instruments since the last period is recorded to Other gains and
    losses in the income statement in the period of the change;
    however, in accordance with SFAS 133, any amounts
    previously recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income
    would remain there until such time as the original forecasted
    transaction occurs, then would be reclassified to Fuel and oil
    expense. In a situation where it becomes probable that a hedged
    forecasted transaction will not occur, any gains

and/or

losses that have been recorded to Accumulated other
    comprehensive income would be required to be immediately
    reclassified into earnings. The Company did not have any such
    situations occur in 2005, 2006, or 2007.

Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative
    positions based in other crude oil related commodities,
    especially given the magnitude of the current fair market value
    of the Company’s fuel derivatives and the recent volatility
    in the prices of refined products. Due to the volatility in
    markets for crude oil and related products, the Company is
    unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period,
    including the loss of hedge accounting, which could be
    determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the
    aggregate for a specific commodity. This may result, and has
    resulted, in increased volatility in the Company’s results.
    The significant increase in the amount of hedge ineffectiveness
    and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts settling
    in future periods recorded during the past few years has been
    due to a number of factors. These factors included: the
    significant fluctuation in energy prices, the number of
    derivative positions the Company holds, significant weather
    events that have affected refinery capacity and



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the production of refined products, and the volatility of the
    different types of products the Company uses for protection. The
    number of instances in which the Company has discontinued hedge
    accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined
    products, such as unleaded gasoline, has increased recently,
    primarily due to these reasons. In these cases, the Company has
    determined that the hedges will not regain effectiveness in the
    time period remaining until settlement and therefore must
    discontinue special hedge accounting, as defined by
    SFAS 133. When this happens, any changes in fair value of
    the derivative instruments are marked to market through earnings
    in the period of change. However, even though these derivatives
    may not qualify for SFAS 133 special hedge accounting, the
    Company continues to hold the instruments as it believes they
    continue to represent good “economic hedges” in its
    goal to minimize jet fuel costs. As the fair value of the
    Company’s hedge positions can fluctuate significantly in
    amount from period to period, it is more probable that there
    will be continued variability recorded in the income statement
    and that the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized
    gains or losses for changes in value of the derivatives recorded
    in future periods will be material. This is primarily due to the
    fact that small differences in the correlation of crude oil
    related products are leveraged over large dollar volumes.

All cash flows associated with purchasing and selling
    derivatives are classified as operating cash flows in the
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, either as a component of
    changes in Other current assets or Other, net, depending on
    whether the derivative will settle within twelve months or
    beyond twelve months, respectively. The following table presents

The fair value of the derivative instruments, depending on the
    type of instrument, was determined by the use of present value
    methods or standard option value models with assumptions about
    commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets.
    Included in the above total net unrealized gains from fuel
    hedges as of December 31, 2007, are approximately
    $556 million in net unrealized gains that are expected to
    be realized in earnings during 2008. In addition, as of
    December 31, 2007, the Company had already recognized gains
    due to ineffectiveness and derivatives that do not qualify for
    hedge accounting totaling $180 million, net of taxes. These
    gains were recognized in 2007 and prior periods, and are
    reflected in Retained earnings as of December 31, 2007, but
    the underlying derivative instruments will not expire/settle
    until 2008 or future periods.

Interest
    Rate Swaps

During first quarter 2007, the Company executed interest rate
    swap agreements relating to its $300 million



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017 and its
    $100 million 7.375% senior unsecured debentures due
    2027. Under the agreement related to its $300 million
    5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017, the average
    floating rate paid during 2007 was 4.64 percent. Under the
    agreement related to its $100 million 7.375% senior
    unsecured debentures due 2027, the average floating rate paid
    during 2007 was 6.73 percent.

Prior to 2007, the Company had entered into interest rate swap
    agreements relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior
    unsecured notes due 2012 and its $350 million
    5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014. Under each of these
    interest rate swap agreements, the Company pays the London
    InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin every six months on
    the notional amount of the debt, and receives payments based on
    the fixed stated rate of the notes every six months until the
    date the notes become due. Under the agreement related to its
    $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, the
    average floating rate paid during 2007 is estimated to be
    7.31 percent based on actual and forward rates at
    December 31, 2007. Under the agreement related to its
    $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014,
    the average floating rate paid during 2007 was 6.02 percent.

The primary objective for the Company’s use of interest
    rate hedges is to reduce the volatility of net interest income
    by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities.
    The Company’s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair
    value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. The fair values of
    the interest rate swap agreements, which are adjusted regularly,
    are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as necessary,
    with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the
    long-term debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap
    agreements, excluding accrued interest, at December 31,
    2007, was an asset of approximately $16 million and is
    recorded in “Other deferred liabilities” in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with fair value
    hedging, the offsetting entry is an adjustment to increase the
    carrying value of long-term debt. See Note 7.

Outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the Company
    to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
    counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not
    expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet its
    obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial
    instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a
    positive fair value at the reporting date. To manage credit
    risk, the Company selects and periodically reviews
    counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a
    single counterparty, and monitors the market position of the
    program and its relative market position with each counterparty.
    At December 31, 2007, the Company had agreements with nine
    counterparties containing early termination rights

and/or

bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if
    market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or
    credit ratings fall below certain levels. At December 31,
    2007, the Company held $2.0 billion in fuel hedge related
    cash collateral deposits under these bilateral collateral
    provisions. These collateral deposits serve to decrease, but not
    totally eliminate, the credit risk associated with the
    Company’s hedging program. The cash deposits, which can

Common
    Stock

The Company has one class of capital stock, its common stock.
    Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive
    dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors and are
    entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a
    vote of the shareholders. At December 31, 2007, the Company
    had 82 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance
    pursuant to Employee stock benefit plans (of which
    32 million shares had not been granted.)

In January 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the
    Company’s common stock, utilizing proceeds from the
    exercise of Employee stock options. Repurchases were made in
    accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or
    in private transactions from time to time, depending on market
    conditions. During first quarter 2005, the Company completed
    this program. In total, the Company repurchased approximately
    21 million of its common shares during the course of the
    program.

In 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized three
    separate programs for the repurchase of up to a total of
    $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock —
    $300 million authorized in January 2006, $300 million
    authorized in May 2006, and $400 million authorized in
    November 2006. Repurchases were made in accordance with
    applicable securities laws in the open market or in private
    transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions.
    These programs, which were completed during first quarter 2007,
    resulted in the repurchase of a total of approximately
    63 million shares.

In 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized two
    separate programs for the repurchase of up to a total of
    $800 million of the Company’s common stock —
    $300 million authorized in March 2007, and
    $500 million authorized in May 2007. Repurchases were made
    in

    quarter 2007, resulted in the repurchase of a total of
    approximately 53 million shares.

During January 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized an additional program for the repurchase of up to
    $500 million of the Company’s Common Stock.
    Repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable

Stock
    Plans

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company has share-based compensation plans covering the
    majority of its Employee groups, including plans adopted via
    collective bargaining, a plan covering the Company’s Board
    of Directors, and plans related to employment contracts with the
    Executive Chairman of the Company. Effective January 1,
    2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions
    of SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”
    using the modified retrospective transition method. Among other
    items, SFAS 123R eliminated the use of APB 25 and the
    intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires recognition
    of the cost of Employee services received in exchange for awards
    of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of
    those awards, in the financial statements.

Under the modified retrospective method, compensation cost is
    recognized in the financial statements beginning with the
    effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for
    all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on
    the requirements of SFAS 123 for all unvested awards
    granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R. In
    addition, results for prior periods were retrospectively
    adjusted in first quarter 2006 utilizing the pro forma
    disclosures in those prior financial statements, except as
    noted. The Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 reflects share-based
    compensation cost of $37 million, $80 million, and
    $80 million, respectively. The total tax benefit recognized
    from share-based compensation arrangements for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, was $11 million,
    $27 million, and $25 million, respectively. As a
    result of the SFAS 123R retroactive application, for the
    year ended December 31, 2005, net income was reduced by
    $55 million, net income per share, basic was reduced by
    $.08, and net income per share, diluted was reduced by $.06.

Stock
    Plans

The Company has stock plans covering Employees subject to
    collective bargaining agreements (collective bargaining plans)
    and stock plans covering Employees not subject to collective
    bargaining agreements (other Employee plans). None of the
    collective bargaining plans were required to be approved by
    shareholders. Options granted to Employees under collective
    bargaining plans are non-qualified, granted at or above the fair
    market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of
    grant, and generally have terms ranging from six to twelve
    years. Neither Executive Officers nor members of the
    Company’s Board of Directors are eligible to participate in
    any of these collective bargaining plans. Options granted to
    Employees through other Employee plans are both qualified as
    incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
    and non-qualified stock options, granted at no less than the
    fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date
    of grant, and have ten-year terms. All of the options included
    under the heading of “Other Employee Plans” have been
    approved by shareholders, except the plan covering
    non-management, non-contract Employees, which had options
    outstanding to purchase 5 million shares of the
    Company’s Common Stock as of December 31, 2007. The
    Company also has plans related to past employment agreements
    with its current Executive Chairman. As of December 31,
    2007, there were 556,000 options outstanding under these plans,
    all of which were fully vested. Although the Company does not
    have a formal policy, upon option exercise, the Company will
    typically issue treasury stock, to the extent such shares are
    available.

Vesting terms for the collective bargaining plans differ based
    on the grant made, and have ranged in length from immediate
    vesting to vesting periods in accordance with the period covered
    by the respective collective bargaining agreement. For
    “Other Employee Plans,” options vest and generally
    become fully exercisable over three, five, or ten years of
    continued employment, depending upon the grant type. For grants
    in any of the Company’s plans that are subject to graded
    vesting over a service period, Southwest recognizes expense on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
    entire award. None of the Company’s grants include
    performance-based or market-based vesting conditions, as defined.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
    grant using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    following weighted-average assumptions were used for grants made
    under the fixed option plans for the current and prior years:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use
    in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that
    have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
    addition, option valuation models require the input of somewhat
    subjective assumptions including expected stock price
    volatility. For 2007 and 2006, the Company has relied on
    observations of both historical volatility trends as well as
    implied future volatility observations as determined by
    independent third parties. For both 2007 and 2006 stock option
    grants, the Company utilized expected volatility based on the
    expected life of the option, but within a range of
    24 percent to 27 percent. Prior to 2006, the Company
    relied exclusively on historical volatility as an input for
    determining the estimated fair value of stock options. In
    determining the expected life of the option grants, the Company
    has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar
    characteristics, the actual vesting schedule of the grant, and
    assessed the expected risk tolerance of different optionee
    groups. The risk-free interest rates used, which were actual
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon rates for bonds matching the
    expected term of the option as of the option grant date, ranged
    from .50 percent to 5.37 percent for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, from 4.26 percent to
    5.24 percent for 2006, and from 3.37 percent to
    4.47 percent for 2005.

The fair value of options granted under the fixed option plans
    during the year ended December 31, 2007, ranged from $0.67
    to $6.33, with a weighted-average fair value of $4.28. The fair
    value of options granted under the fixed option plans during
    2006 ranged from $2.48 to $6.99, with a weighted-average fair
    value of $5.47. The fair value of options granted under the
    fixed option plans during 2005 ranged from $2.90 to $6.79, with
    a weighted-average fair value of $4.49.

    $137 million, $262 million, and $179 million,
    respectively. The total fair value of shares vesting during the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, was
    $64 million, $112 million, and $96 million,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2007, there was
    $37 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related
    to share-based compensation arrangements, which is expected to
    be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.25 years.
    The total recognition period for the remaining unrecognized
    compensation cost is approximately eight years; however, the
    majority of this cost will be recognized over the next two
    years, in accordance with vesting provisions.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

Under the amended 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP),
    which has been approved by shareholders, the Company is
    authorized to issue up to a remaining balance of
    6.5 million shares of Common Stock to Employees of the
    Company. These shares may be issued at a price equal to
    90 percent of the market value at the end of each monthly
    purchase period. Common Stock purchases are paid for through
    periodic payroll deductions. For the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, participants under the
    plan purchased 1.3 million shares, 1.2 million shares,
    and 1.5 million shares at average prices of $13.30, $14.86,
    and $13.19, respectively. The weighted-average fair value of
    each purchase right under the ESPP granted for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, which is equal to the
    ten percent discount from the market value of the Common Stock
    at the end of each monthly purchase period, was $1.48, $1.65,
    and $1.47, respectively.

Non-Employee
    Director Grants and Incentive Plan

Upon initial election to the Board, non-Employee Directors
    receive a one-time option grant to purchase 10,000 shares
    of Southwest Common Stock at the fair market value of such stock
    on the date of the grant. These grants are made out of one of
    the Company’s plans covering Employees not subject to
    collective bargaining agreements (other Employee plans). Stock
    option grants to the Board become exercisable over a period of
    three years from the grant date and have a term of 10 years.

In 2001, the Board adopted the Southwest
    Airlines Co. Outside Director Incentive Plan. The
    purpose of the plan is to align more closely the interests of
    the non-Employee Directors with those of the Company’s
    Shareholders and to provide the non-Employee Directors with
    retirement income. To accomplish this purpose, the plan
    compensates each non-Employee Director based on the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

performance of the Company’s Common Stock and defers the
    receipt of such compensation until after the non-Employee
    Director ceases to be a Director of the Company. Pursuant to the
    plan, on the date of the 2002 Annual Meeting of Shareholders,
    the Company granted 750 non-transferable Performance Shares to
    each non-Employee Director who had served as a Director since at
    least May 2001. Thereafter, on the date of each Annual Meeting
    of Shareholders, the Company granted 750 Performance Shares to
    each non-Employee Director who has served since the previous
    Annual Meeting. Effective beginning with the 2007 Annual
    Meeting, the plan was amended to increase the annual number of
    Performance Shares to be granted to 1,000. A Performance Share
    is a unit of value equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of
    Southwest Common Stock, based on the average closing sale price
    of the Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
    during a specified period. On the

th

calendar
    day following the date a non-Employee Director ceases to serve
    as a Director of the Company for any reason, Southwest will pay
    to such former non-Employee Director an amount equal to the Fair
    Market Value of the Common Stock during the 30 days
    preceding such last date of service multiplied by the number of
    Performance Shares then held by such Director. The plan contains
    provisions contemplating adjustments on changes in
    capitalization of the Company. The Company accounts for grants
    made under this plan as liability awards, as defined, and since
    the awards are not stock options, they are not reflected in the
    above tables. The fair value of the awards as of
    December 31, 2007, which is not material to the Company, is
    included in Accrued liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.

Taxes

A portion of the Company’s granted options qualify as
    incentive stock options (ISO) for income tax purposes. As such,
    a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost
    related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the
    fact that an ISO does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit
    unless there is a disqualifying disposition. Stock option grants
    of non-qualified options result in the creation of a deferred
    tax asset, which is a temporary difference, until the time that
    the option is exercised. Due to the treatment of incentive stock
    options for tax purposes, the Company’s effective tax rate
    from year to year is subject to variability.

Employee
    Retirement Plans

Defined
    Contribution Plans

The Company has defined contribution plans covering
    substantially all Southwest Employees. The Southwest Airlines
    Co. Profit Sharing Plan (Profit Sharing Plan) is a money
    purchase defined contribution plan and Employee stock purchase
    plan. However, the Profit Sharing Plan was amended as of
    January 1, 2008, and is now characterized as simply a
    Profit Sharing Plan. The Company contributes 15 percent of
    its eligible pre-tax profits, as defined, to the Profit Sharing
    Plan on an annual basis. No Employee contributions to the Profit
    Sharing Plan are allowed.

The Company also sponsors Employee savings plans under
    section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which include
    Company matching contributions. The 401(k) plans cover
    substantially all Employees. Contributions under all defined
    contribution plans are primarily based on Employee compensation
    and performance of the Company.

Company contributions to all retirement plans expensed in 2007,
    2006, and 2005 were $279 million, $301 million, and
    $264 million, respectively.

Postretirement
    Benefit Plans

The Company provides postretirement benefits to qualified
    retirees in the form of medical and dental coverage. Employees
    must meet minimum levels of service and age requirements as set
    forth by the Company, or as specified in collective bargaining
    agreements with specific workgroups. Employees meeting these
    requirements, as defined, may use accrued unused sick time to
    pay for medical and dental premiums from the age of retirement
    until age 65.

The following table shows the change in the Company’s
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for the
    years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:

The Company’s plans are unfunded, and benefits are paid as
    they become due. For 2007, both benefits paid and Company
    contributions to the plans were each $6 million. For 2006,
    both benefits paid and Company contributions to the plans were
    each $5 million. Estimated future benefit payments expected
    to be paid for each of the next five years are $6 million
    in 2008, $7 million in 2009, $8 million in 2010,
    $9 million in 2011, $10 million in 2012, and
    $80 million for the next five years thereafter.

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition
    and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158. SFAS 158
    requires the Company to recognize the funded status (i.e., the
    difference between the fair value of plan assets and the
    projected benefit obligations) of its benefit plans in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to
    accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The
    following table reconciles the funded status of the plan to the
    Company’s accrued postretirement benefit cost recognized in
    “Other deferred liabilities” on the Company’s

During 2007, the Company recorded a $31 million actuarial
    gain as a decrease to the recognized obligation with the offset
    to accumulated other comprehensive income. This actuarial gain
    is included above and resulted from Congress’ passage of a
    law to increase the mandatory retirement age for
    U.S. commercial airline pilots from 60 to 65, effective
    immediately. Therefore, since the Company projects that some of
    its Pilots will now work past age 60, this assumption
    resulted in a decrease to the Company’s projected future
    postretirement obligation.

The Company’s periodic postretirement benefit cost for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, included the

    7.50% for 2008, then decline gradually to 5% by 2014 and remain
    level thereafter.

The selection of a discount rate is made annually and is
    selected by the Company based upon comparison of the expected
    cash flows associated with the Company’s future payments
    under its postretirement obligations to a hypothetical bond
    portfolio created using high quality bonds that closely match
    those expected cash flows. The assumed healthcare trend rate is
    also reviewed at least annually and is determined based upon
    both historical experience with the Company’s healthcare
    benefits paid and expectations of how those trends may or may
    not change in future years.

For the year 2004, Southwest had a tax net operating loss of
    $616 million for federal income tax purposes. The Company
    carried a portion of this net operating loss back to prior
    periods, resulting in a $35 million refund of federal taxes
    previously paid. This refund was received during 2005. The
    Company applied a portion of this 2004 net operating loss
    to the 2005 and 2006 tax years, resulting in the payment of no
    regular federal income taxes for these years. The remaining
    portion of the Company’s federal net operating loss was
    utilized during 2007.

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48), which clarifies
    the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions,
    as defined. FIN 48 seeks to reduce the diversity in
    practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and
    measurement related to accounting for income taxes. The Company
    is subject to the provisions of FIN 48 as of
    January 1, 2007, and has analyzed filing positions in all
    of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to
    file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these
    jurisdictions. The Company has identified its federal tax return
    and its state tax returns in California and Texas as
    “major” tax jurisdictions, as defined. The only
    periods subject to examination for the Company’s federal
    tax returns are the 2005 and 2006 tax years. The periods subject
    to examination for the Company’s state tax returns in
    California and Texas are years 2002 through 2006. The Company
    believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions
    will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any
    adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or
    cash flow. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax
    positions have been recorded pursuant to FIN 48. In
    addition, the Company did not record a cumulative effect
    adjustment related to the adoption of FIN 48.

The Company’s policy for recording interest and penalties
    associated with audits is to record such items as a component of
    income before taxes. Penalties are recorded in “Other
    (gains) losses, net,” and interest paid or received is
    recorded in interest expense or interest income, respectively,
    in the statement of income. For the year ended December 31,
    2007, the Company recorded approximately $1 million in
    interest income related to the settlement of audits for certain
    prior periods.

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims

income tax returns and, in the course thereof, proposes
    adjustments to the Company’s federal income tax liability
    reported on such returns. It is the Company’s practice to
    vigorously contest those proposed adjustments it deems lacking
    of merit.

The Company’s management does not expect that the outcome
    in any of its currently ongoing legal proceedings or the outcome
    of any proposed adjustments presented to date by the IRS,
    individually or collectively, will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flow.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Southwest Airlines Co. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2007. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Southwest Airlines Co. at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Southwest Airlines Co.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated January 31, 2008 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.

We have audited Southwest Airlines Co.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Southwest Airlines
    Co.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Southwest Airlines Co. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Southwest Airlines Co. as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007 of Southwest Airlines Co. and our report
    dated January 31, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures.

The Company maintains disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable
    assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the
    Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
    within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
    forms. These include controls and procedures designed to ensure
    that this information is accumulated and communicated to the
    Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the
    participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial
    Officers, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2007.
    Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
    as of December 31, 2007 at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting.

Management of the Company is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act). The Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control
    objectives.

Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and
    Chief Financial Officers, evaluated the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework. Based on this
    evaluation, management, with the participation of the Chief
    Executive and Chief Financial Officers, concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2007, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective.



Ernst & Young, LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm who audited the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements included in this

Form 10-K,

has issued a report on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting, which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

There were no changes in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2007, that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.
