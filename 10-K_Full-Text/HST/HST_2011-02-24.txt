EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 of Host Hotels &
Resorts, Inc. and Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Host Inc.” mean Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., a Maryland corporation and references to “Host
L.P.” mean Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and its consolidated subsidiaries. We use the terms “we” or “our” or “the company” to refer to Host Inc. and Host L.P. together,
unless the context indicates otherwise. We use the term Host Inc. to specifically refer to Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and the term Host L.P. to specifically refer to Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. (and its consolidated subsidiaries)
in cases where it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P.

Host Inc. operates as a self-managed and
self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT. Host Inc. owns properties and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and in which it holds approximately 98.4% of the partnership interests
(“OP units”). The remaining approximate 1.6% partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. As the sole general partner of Host L.P., Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.’s
day-to-day management and control.

We believe combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Host Inc. and Host L.P. into
this single report will result in the following benefits:

•

enhancing investors’ understanding of Host Inc. and Host L.P. by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as
management views and operates the business;

•

eliminating duplicative disclosure and providing a more streamlined presentation, since a substantial portion of our disclosure applies to both Host
Inc. and Host L.P.; and

•

creating time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

Management operates Host Inc. and Host L.P. as one enterprise. The management of Host Inc. consists of the same members who direct the
management of Host L.P. The executive officers of Host Inc. are appointed by Host Inc.’s board of directors, but are employed by Host L.P. Host L.P. employs everyone who works for Host Inc. or Host L.P. As general partner with control of Host
L.P., Host Inc. consolidates Host L.P. for financial reporting purposes, and Host Inc. does not have significant assets other than its investment in Host L.P. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are the same on their
respective financial statements.

There are a few differences between Host Inc. and Host L.P., which are reflected in the
disclosure in this report. We believe it is important to understand the differences between Host Inc. and Host L.P. in the context of how Host Inc. and Host L.P. operate as an interrelated consolidated company. Host Inc. is a REIT whose only
material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of Host L.P. As a result, Host Inc. does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of Host L.P., and issuing public equity from time to time, the proceeds from
which are contributed to Host L.P. in exchange for OP units. Host Inc. itself does not issue any indebtedness and does not guarantee the debt or obligations of Host L.P. Host L.P. holds substantially all of our assets and holds the ownership
interests in our joint ventures. Host L.P. conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by Host Inc., Host L.P. generates the capital
required by our business through Host L.P.’s operations, by Host L.P.’s direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness, through the issuance of OP units or through the sale of equity interests of its subsidiaries.

The substantive difference between Host Inc.’s and Host L.P.’s filings is the fact that Host Inc. is a REIT with public stock,
while Host L.P. is a partnership with no publicly traded equity. In the financial statements, this difference is primarily reflected in the equity (or partners’ capital for Host L.P.) section of the consolidated balance sheets and in the
consolidated statements of equity (or partners’ capital) and comprehensive income (loss). Apart from the different equity treatment, the financial statements of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are nearly identical, with the major difference being that
the net income allocated to the outside owners of Host L.P., who, in aggregate, hold

i


1.6% of the partnership units, is deducted from net income of Host Inc. in order to arrive at net income attributable to common stockholders. This amount is included in net income attributable to
common unitholders for Host L.P. Also, earnings per share will generally be slightly less than the earnings per OP unit as, subsequent to the 2009 common stock election dividend, each Host Inc. common share is the equivalent of .97895 OP units
(instead of 1 OP unit). This stock dividend caused an approximate 2% difference in earnings per share when compared to earnings per OP unit beginning in 2010.

To help investors understand the differences between Host Inc. and Host L.P., this report presents the following separate sections or portions of sections for each of Host Inc. and Host L.P.:

•

Part II Item 5 - Market for Registrant’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for Host Inc. /
Market for Registrant’s Common Units, Related Unitholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for Host L.P.;

•

Part II Item 6 - Selected Financial Data;

•

Part II Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations will be combined, except for a
separate discussion of any material differences in the liquidity and capital resources between Host Inc. and Host L.P.

•

Part II Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk will be combined, except for separate discussions of any material
differences between Host Inc. and Host L.P.

•

Part II Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. While the financial statements themselves are presented separately, the
notes to the financial statements are generally combined, except for the following notes:

•

Equity of Host Inc. / Capital of Host L.P. will be combined, except for separate discussions of differences between equity of Host Inc. and capital of
Host L.P.; and

•

Supplemental Guarantor and Non-Guarantor Information for Host L.P.

This report also includes separate Item 9A. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for
each of Host Inc. and Host L.P. in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Host Inc. and the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Host Inc. as the general partner of Host L.P. have
made the requisite certifications and that Host Inc. and Host L.P. are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C. §1350.

The separate discussions of Host Inc. and Host L.P. in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the
results of the company on a consolidated basis and how management operates the company.

Forward Looking Statements

Our disclosure and analysis in this 2010 Form 10-K and in Host Inc.’s 2010 Annual Report to stockholders contain some forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on
management’s plans and assumptions. From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public. Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify each such statement by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,”
“plan,” “believe,” “will,” “target,” “forecast” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these forward-looking statements
include those relating to future actions, future acquisitions or dispositions, future capital expenditure plans, future performance or results of current and anticipated expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates or the outcome of
contingencies, such as legal proceedings.

We cannot guarantee that any future results discussed in any forward-looking
statements will be realized, although we believe that we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions, including those discussed in
Item 1A “Risk Factors.” Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those results anticipated, estimated
or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to publicly
update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make or related subjects in our reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K that we file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Also note that, in our risk factors, we provide a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that,
individually or in the aggregate, we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from past results and those results anticipated, estimated or projected. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the risk factor discussion to be a complete discussion of all of the potential risks or uncertainties that could
affect our business.

Item 1. Business

Consolidated Portfolio

As of February 18, 2011, we have 120 hotels in
our portfolio, primarily consisting of luxury and upper upscale hotels containing approximately 63,000 rooms as detailed below:

(1)

Includes properties in 25 states and Washington, D.C.



European Joint Venture

We own a 32.1% interest in a European joint venture that owns 11 luxury and upper upscale hotels containing 3,510 rooms. The hotels owned by the European joint venture are located in the following
countries:

We are the general partner of the European joint venture and act as the asset manager for these hotels, as
well as an additional 440 room property in Paris, France in exchange for a fee.

Asian Joint Venture

We also own a 25% interest in an Asian joint venture that is in the process of acquiring a 36% interest in a joint venture that is
developing seven properties totaling approximately 1,750 rooms in India. The Indian joint venture agreement is contingent upon receiving certain approvals from the government of India, which are expected to be completed early in 2011. The properties
will be managed by Accor under the Pullman, Novotel and ibis brands and we anticipate that we will act as asset manager for these hotels and other Asian joint venture investments. The first hotel, the ibis Bangalore, is expected to open in the
second quarter of 2011.

Other Real Estate Investments

Our other real estate investments represent less than 1% of our overall assets and less than 5% of our overall revenues. We lease 53 Courtyard by Marriott select-service hotels from Hospitality Properties
Trust (“HPT”) that are located in 24 states in the United States. We have given notice that we intend to terminate these leases on December 31, 2012. Additionally, we own €64 million ($87 million) face amount of the two
most junior tranches of a mortgage note receivable secured by six hotels in Europe, and have non-controlling interests in three partnerships that own a total of one hotel and a golf course.

The Lodging Industry

The lodging industry in the United States consists of private and public entities that operate in an extremely diversified
market under a variety of brand names. The lodging industry has several key participants:

•

Owners—own the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel. These properties may be branded and
operated under the manager’s brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager. The properties also may be operated as an independent hotel (unaffiliated with any brand) by an
independent hotel manager. We operate as an owner of lodging properties.

•

Owner/Managers—own the hotel and operate the property with their own management team. These properties may be branded under a franchise agreement,
operated as an independent hotel (unaffiliated with any brand) or operated under the owner’s brand. We are restricted from operating and managing hotels under applicable REIT rules.

•

Franchisors—own a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system. Franchisors
provide their branded hotels with brand recognition, marketing support and centralized reservation systems.

•

Franchisor/Managers—own a brand or brands and also operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee.

•

Manager—operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner, but do not, themselves, own a brand. The hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement
or as an independent hotel unaffiliated with any brand.

The hotel manager is responsible for the day-to-day
operation of the hotels, including the employment of hotel staff, the determination of room rates, the development of sales and marketing plans, the preparation of operating and capital expenditure budgets and the preparation of financial reports
for the owner. They typically receive fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel.

Our industry is influenced
by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms. Lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy in addition to local market factors that stimulate travel to specific destinations. In
particular, economic indicators such as GDP growth, business investment and employment growth are some of the primary drivers of lodging demand. Between 2003 and 2007, broad growth in the economy led to increases in demand. However, the global
recession that began in the second half of 2008 and lasted throughout much of 2009 resulted in a considerable decline in both consumer and business spending. In addition to the overall weak GDP performance, high unemployment and low business
investment, several other factors, including the uncertainty in the credit markets, weakness in the housing market, and volatile energy and commodity prices contributed to an extremely negative demand environment. As a result, during 2009 the
lodging industry experienced its largest year-over-year decline in demand on record. During 2010, economic indicators began to improve due to strengthening GDP and business investment, although these improvements have been tempered by continued
high-unemployment. While lodging demand has not recovered fully from the steep declines experienced in 2008 and 2009, it has recovered significantly, led by transient demand from business and leisure travelers. While there is still uncertainty in
the strength of the current economic recovery, particularly as unemployment remains high, we believe that lodging demand will continue to grow in 2011 as the economy continues to recover.



Lodging supply growth is generally driven by overall lodging demand, as extended periods of
strong demand growth tend to encourage new development. However, the rate of supply growth also is influenced by a number of additional factors, including the availability of capital, interest rates, construction costs and unique market
considerations. The relatively long lead-time required to complete the development of hotels makes supply growth relatively easier to forecast than demand growth, but increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry. As
illustrated in the charts below, at different points in the cycle, demand and supply may increase or decrease in a dissimilar manner such that demand may increase when there is no new supply or supply may grow when demand is declining. Beginning in
the second half of 2008, the stress in the credit markets made financing for new hotel construction extremely difficult to obtain. This, coupled with the decline in lodging demand during 2008 and 2009 due to the global economic recession, caused a
significant reduction in new hotel construction starts. As a result, supply growth was relatively low in 2010, and we expect growth to be well below historical averages through 2012, which is consistent with analysis prepared by Smith Travel
Research (STR).

Revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) is an operational measure commonly used in the hotel industry
to evaluate hotel performance. RevPAR represents the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved, but excludes other revenue generated by a hotel property, such as food and beverage, parking and other
guest service revenues.

The charts below detail the historical supply, demand and RevPAR growth for the U.S. lodging industry
and for the upper upscale segment for 2007 to 2010 and forecast data for 2011. Historical industry trends have indicated that hotels in the upper upscale segment have generally outperformed the lodging industry in terms of RevPAR growth over time.
Our portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale hotels and, accordingly, its performance is best understood in comparison to the upper upscale segment rather than the entire industry.

U.S. Lodging Industry Supply, Demand and RevPAR Growth



U.S. upper upscale Supply, Demand and RevPAR Growth

Business Strategy

Our primary long-term business objective is to provide superior total returns to our equity holders through a combination of appreciation in asset values, growth in earnings and dividend distributions. To
achieve this objective, we seek to:

•

Acquire properties in urban and resort/conference destinations that are operated by leading management companies. These investments primarily will be
located in gateway cities with significant appeal to multiple customer segments. While we will continue to focus on luxury and upper upscale hotel properties in our target markets, we intend to expand our investments to include midscale and upscale
properties, particularly in international markets;

•

Strategically invest in major repositioning and return on investment (“ROI”) projects in order to maximize the inherent value in our
portfolio;

•

Drive operating results at our properties through aggressive asset management;

•

Maintain a strong balance sheet with a low leverage level and balanced debt maturities in order to minimize the cost of capital and to maximize our
financial flexibility in order to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging business cycle;

•

Expand our global portfolio holdings and revenue sources through joint ventures or direct acquisitions that diversify our investments; and

•

Dispose of non-core assets, including hotels that are at a competitive risk or that are located in suburban or slower-growth markets.

Acquisitions

.

Our acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring hotel properties
domestically and internationally at attractive yields that exceed our cost of capital. Domestically, our core acquisition strategy will continue to focus on upper upscale and luxury hotel properties located in the central business districts of key
gateway cities with high barriers to entry as, historically, these properties have demonstrated higher RevPAR growth. In addition, we also are



evaluating opportunities to develop upscale and midscale hotels in similar locations in order to leverage our growth strategy. In the European market, our acquisition targets will continue to be
concentrated in the upper upscale and luxury segments. In the fast-growing emerging markets, primarily Asia-Pacific and South America (particularly Brazil), in addition to acquiring upper upscale properties, we also will pursue the acquisition or
development of midscale and upscale hotels, as we believe the limited supply of quality lodging products in these markets creates an opportunity for solid returns on this type of investment.

We look for opportunities to take advantage of the lodging cycle’s effect on property valuations in order to maximize the potential
to achieve returns in excess of our cost of capital and to diversify our risk. We believe that we are currently in the early stages of a growth period in the lodging cycle which began in the first half of 2010, and we will continue to seek to
opportunistically acquire high-quality lodging properties consistent with our investment strategy.

Repositioning,
Return on Investment Projects and Value Enhancement Projects

. We pursue opportunities to enhance asset value by completing select capital improvements outside the scope of typical renewal and replacement capital expenditures. In a typical
year, these investments may represent 50% or more of our capital expenditures.

Repositioning and Acquisition Investments.

We strive to optimally position our properties within their respective markets in order to maximize their earnings potential. To that end, we will complete major capital projects that may reposition the property within their competitive set.
These projects include, for example, significant renovations of guest rooms, lobbies or food and beverage platforms and expanding ballroom, spa or conference facilities. These projects are designed to take advantage of changing market conditions and
the favorable location of our properties to enhance customer satisfaction and increase profitability. Similarly, in conjunction with the acquisition of a property, we often will have a capital improvement plan in place that we consider in the
overall evaluation of the investment that we believe will enhance the profitability of the hotel.

Return on Investment
Projects.

We also will complete various projects at our properties that are intended to improve the operating performance of the property. These projects are often smaller, more targeted projects that focus on specific areas, such as
adding/renovating spa, restaurant, or meeting space or that are designed to enhance energy efficiency. In certain instances, these ROI projects have coincided with the timing of regular maintenance cycles, where we have used the opportunity to
significantly improve and upgrade the hotel. We also consider the environmental and social impacts of our business operations when planning our capital projects. Working closely with our managers, our design and construction and asset management
teams invest in the most energy efficient and sustainable technologies whenever feasible. Examples are: tri-generation plants; laundry waste water recycling systems; EPA ENERGY STAR® qualified appliances and electronics; EPA WaterSense®
labeled plumbing fixtures; energy efficient lighting; sustainable construction practices; and materials made from recycled content. We also fund our management companies’ sustainability initiatives and encourage the achievement of LEED® and
other green or state level certifications at our hotels.

Value enhancement projects.

We seek opportunities to
enhance the value of our portfolio by identifying and executing strategies that maximize the highest and best use of all aspects of our properties, such as the development of timeshare or condominium units on excess land, or the acquisition of air
rights or developer entitlements that add value to our portfolio or enhance the value in the event that we sell the property.

Asset Management

.

As Host Inc. is the largest REIT owner of luxury and upper upscale properties in the U.S., we
are in a unique position to work with the managers of our hotels in order to maximize revenues, while minimizing operating costs. The size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading operators and brands in the
industry allow us to benchmark similar hotels and identify best practices and identify efficiencies that can be implemented at our properties. Areas of focus include enhancing revenue management for rooms, food and beverage and other services,
reducing operating costs and identifying operating efficiencies, all of which improve the long-term profitability of the hotel.

Another key component of our asset management strategy focuses on maintaining our high standards for product quality in order to maintain
and enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace. We work closely with our managers to ensure that renewal and replacement expenditures are spent efficiently in order to maximize the



profitability of the hotel. Typically, room refurbishments occur at intervals of approximately seven years, but the timing may vary based on the type of property and equipment being replaced.
These refurbishments generally are divided into the following types: soft goods, case goods and infrastructure. Soft goods include items such as carpeting, bed spreads, curtains and wall vinyl and may require more frequent updates in order to
maintain brand quality standards. Case goods include items such as dressers, desks, couches, restaurant and meeting room chairs and tables and are generally not replaced as frequently. Infrastructure includes the physical plant of the hotel,
including the roof, elevators, façade and fire systems, which are regularly maintained and then replaced at the end of their useful lives.

Capital structure and liquidity profile

.

As a REIT, Host Inc. is required to distribute 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gain) to its stockholders, and, as a
result, generally must rely on external sources of capital to finance growth. We use a variety of debt and equity instruments in order to fund our external growth, including senior notes and mortgage debt, exchangeable debentures, common and
preferred stock offerings, issuances of Host L.P. partnership units and joint ventures/limited partnerships to best take advantage of the prevailing market conditions. While we may issue debt at any time in order to take advantage of favorable
market conditions, management believes it is prudent, over time, to continue to lower our leverage level, as we believe lower overall leverage will reduce our cost of capital and earnings volatility and provide us with the necessary flexibility to
take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle, which we consider a key competitive advantage. In the near-term, as acquisition opportunities become available, we may look to fund the majority of our investments with proceeds from
equity offerings. Also, later in the lodging cycle, we may look to sell assets at opportunistic pricing levels and use the proceeds to further pay down debt or otherwise reinvest the proceeds.

We also look to structure our debt profile to allow us to access different forms of financing, primarily senior notes and exchangeable
debentures, as well as mortgage debt. Generally, this means we will look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt, minimize near-term maturities and maintain a balanced maturity schedule.

Joint Ventures

.

We expect to continue to utilize joint ventures to finance external growth. We believe
joint ventures provide a significant means to access external capital and spread the inherent risk of hotel ownership. Our primary focus for joint ventures is in international markets, such as in Europe and Asia, which will help to diversify
exposure to market risk. We may also explore joint venture opportunities in North America and Latin America.

Dispositions.

Our disposition strategy focuses on properties where we believe the potential for growth is constrained
or on properties with significant capital expenditure requirements where we do not believe we would generate a significant return on the investment. Primarily, these properties are located in secondary and tertiary markets, as opposed to our target
markets of urban and resort locations. However, we also may dispose of core assets when we have the opportunity to capitalize on value enhancement strategies and apply the proceeds to other business objectives. Proceeds from dispositions are
deployed to repay debt, fund acquisitions and/or fund ROI/repositioning projects.

Corporate Responsibility

Host’s sustainability strategy integrates fiscal responsibility with environmental and social responsibility. Our continuing
objective is to reduce overall carbon emissions, energy consumption, water use and waste generation in our hotels. We seek to achieve results through capital investments, including the implementation of state-of-the-art technologies, innovative
systems, and encouraging our managers to adopt sustainable operational procedures. Our sustainability corporate practices address property design and renovation with coordinated efforts by our operators and our own internal development, design and
construction teams. We also support the achievement of LEED® Existing Building, Green Seal, and other recognized green certifications at our hotels.

Operating Structure

Host Inc. operates through an umbrella partnership
REIT structure in which substantially all of its properties and assets are held by Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and holds approximately 98.4% of the outstanding OP units. As a result of the stock dividend issued by Host
Inc. in December 2009, which affected the conversion ratio of OP units to Host Inc. common stock, each OP unit owned by holders other than Host Inc. is



redeemable, at the option of the holder, for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of Host Inc. common stock multiplied by a factor of 1.021494 (as opposed to a conversion
factor of 1 share/unit that existed prior to the stock dividend). Host Inc. has the right, however, to acquire any OP unit offered for redemption directly from the holder in exchange for 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock, instead of Host
L.P. redeeming such OP unit for cash. Additionally, for every share of common stock issued by Host Inc., Host L.P. will issue .97895 OP units to Host Inc. As of December 31, 2010, there were 675.6 million outstanding common shares of Host
Inc. and Host Inc. owned 661.4 million units of Host L.P. Additionally, non-controlling partners held 10.5 million OP units, which were convertible into 10.7 million Host Inc. common shares. Assuming that all non-controlling interests
were converted into common shares, there would have been 686.3 million common shares of Host Inc. outstanding at December 31, 2010. When distinguishing between Host Inc. and Host L.P., the primary difference is the approximately 1.6% of OP
units not held by Host Inc. as of February 18, 2011. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Distribution/Dividend Policy”.

Our operating structure is as follows:

Because Host Inc. is a REIT, certain tax laws limit the amount of “non-qualifying” income that
Host Inc. can earn, including income derived directly from the operation of hotels. As a result, we lease substantially all of our consolidated properties to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”) for
federal income tax purposes or to third party lessees. Our TRS are subject to income tax and are therefore not limited as to the amount of non-qualifying income they can generate. The lessees and our TRS enter into agreements with third parties to
manage the operations of the hotels. Our TRS also may own assets engaging in other activities that produce non-qualifying income, such as the development of timeshare or condominium units, subject to certain restrictions. The difference between the
hotels’ net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to Host L.P. is retained by our TRS as taxable income. Accordingly, the net effect of the TRS leases is that, while, as a REIT, Host Inc. is generally exempt from federal income tax
to the extent that it meets specific distribution requirements, among other REIT requirements, a portion of the net operating cash flow from our properties is subject to federal, state and, if applicable, foreign income tax.



Our Hotel Properties

Overview.

We have 120 hotels in our portfolio, primarily consisting of luxury and upper upscale properties. These hotels are generally located in the central business districts of major
cities, near airports and resort/conference destinations that, because of their locations, typically benefit from barriers to entry for new supply. These properties typically include meeting and banquet facilities, a variety of restaurants and
lounges, swimming pools, exercise facilities and/or spas, gift shops and parking facilities, the combination of which enable them to serve business, leisure and group travelers. Forty-four of our hotels, representing approximately 65% of our
revenues, have in excess of 500 rooms. The average age of our properties is 28 years, although substantially all of the properties have benefited from significant renovations or major additions, as well as regularly scheduled renewal and replacement
and other capital improvements.

The following chart details our hotel portfolio by brand as of February 18, 2011:

Competition

The lodging industry is highly competitive. Competition is often specific to individual markets and is based on a
number of factors, including location, brand, guest facilities and amenities, level of service, room rates and the quality of accommodations. The lodging industry is generally viewed as consisting of six different segments, each of which caters to a
discrete set of customer tastes and needs: luxury, upper upscale, upscale, midscale (with and without food and beverage service) and economy. The classification of a property is based on lodging industry standards, which take into consideration many
factors such as guest facilities and amenities, level of service and quality of accommodations. Most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties, under such brand names as Ritz-Carlton

®

, Fairmont

®

, Four Seasons

®

, The Luxury
Collection

®

, St. Regis

®

and W

®

, or as upper upscale
properties, under such brand names as Marriott

®

, Hyatt

®

, Westin

®

, Hilton

®

, Sheraton

®

, Le Méridien

®

,
Swissôtel

®

and Delta

brands. While our hotels primarily compete with other hotels in the luxury and upper upscale segments, they also may
compete with hotels in other lower-tier segments.

We believe our properties enjoy competitive advantages associated with the
hotel brands under which they operate. The international marketing programs and reservation systems of these brands, combined with the strong management systems and expertise they provide, should enable our properties to perform favorably in terms
of both occupancy and room rates. In addition, repeat guest business is enhanced by guest reward or guest recognition programs offered by most of these brands. Nevertheless, many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from
converting, franchising or developing other hotel properties in our markets. As a result, our hotels in a given market often compete with other hotels that our managers may own, invest in, manage or franchise.

We also compete with other REITs and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment
opportunities, both domestically and internationally, as we attempt to position our portfolio to take best advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers.

Seasonality

Our hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate
seasonality, which varies based on the individual hotel property and the region. Additionally, hotel revenues for our domestic Marriott-managed hotels typically reflect approximately 16 weeks of results in the fourth quarter compared to
approximately 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year. For our non-Marriott managed hotels, the first quarter includes two months of operations, the second and third quarters include three months of operations and the fourth
quarter includes four months of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Reporting Periods” for more information on our fiscal calendar. Hotel sales have historically
averaged approximately 20%, 26%, 22% and 32% for the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively.

Other Real Estate Investments

European Joint Venture.

We currently own a 32.1% general and limited partnership interest in the European joint venture with
APG Strategic Real Estate Pool NV, a Dutch Pension Fund, and Jasmine Hotels Pte Ltd, an affiliate of the real estate investment company of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd (“GIC RE”). The initial term of the
European joint venture is ten years (ending in 2016), subject to two one-year extensions with partner approval. Due to the ownership structure of the European joint venture and the non-Host limited partners’ unilateral rights to cause the
dissolution and liquidation thereof at any time, the joint venture is not consolidated in our financial statements. We also act as the asset manager for the hotels owned by the European joint venture, as well as one hotel in Paris, France, in
exchange for a fee. As of February 18, 2011, the European joint venture owns the following hotels:

Asian Joint Venture.

We currently own a 25% interest in a joint venture in Asia with
RECO Hotels JV Private Limited, an affiliate of GIC RE. The Asian joint venture is structured as a Singapore Corporation and will explore investment opportunities in various markets throughout Asia, including China, Japan, India, Vietnam and
Australia. The initial term of the Asian joint venture is a period of seven years (ending in 2015). Due to the ownership structure of the Asian joint venture, and our partner’s rights to cause the dissolution and liquidation thereof at any
time, it is not consolidated in our financial statements. On July 20, 2010, the Asian joint venture reached a joint venture agreement with Accor S.A. and InterGlobe Enterprises Limited (the “India joint venture”) to develop seven
properties totaling approximately 1,750 rooms for a total cost of approximately $325 million in three major cities in India: Bangalore, Chennai and Delhi. The Asian joint venture will invest approximately $50 million to acquire approximately
36% of the interest in the India joint venture. The Indian joint venture agreement is contingent upon receiving certain approvals from the government of India, which are expected to be completed early in 2011. The properties will be managed by Accor
under the Pullman, Novotel and ibis brands. Development of the properties is underway, and the ibis Bangalore is expected to open in the second quarter of 2011.

Other Investments.

In addition to the joint ventures described above, we have the following real estate investments:

•

On April 13, 2010, we acquired, at a discount, the two most junior tranches of a €427 million ($581 million) mortgage loan that is
secured by six hotels located in Europe, with a face value of €64 million ($87 million).

•

We own a leasehold interest in 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties which were sold to HPT and leased back to us in 1995. In conjunction with our
conversion to a REIT, in 1999 we entered into a sublease with respect to these properties with a third party on similar terms, with initial terms expiring in 2012. We terminated the subleases effective July 6, 2010 and subsequently act as the
owner under the management agreements.

•

We own a 49% limited partner interest in Tiburon Golf Ventures, L.P., which owns the golf club surrounding The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort, Naples.



For additional detail of our other real estate investments, including a summary of the
outstanding debt balances of our affiliates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Investments in Affiliates” and Note 3 “Investments in Affiliates” and Note 7
“Leases” in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Foreign Operations

Excluding hotels owned by our European joint venture, as of December 31, 2010, we own one property in Brazil, four in Canada, one in
the United Kingdom, one in Mexico and two in Chile, which collectively contain approximately 3,000 rooms. Approximately 4% of our revenues were attributed to the operations of these properties in 2010 and 3% in each of 2009 and 2008. Additionally,
subsequent to year end, we acquired seven hotels in New Zealand. See Note 16 “Geographic and Business Segment Information” for information related to our operations and information regarding geographic areas.

Environmental and Regulatory Matters

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of
hazardous or toxic substances. These laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain environmental laws and common law
principles could be used to impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released asbestos-containing
materials. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures. In connection with our current or prior
ownership or operation of hotels, we may be potentially liable for various environmental costs or liabilities. Although we are currently not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us, we can offer no assurance that
a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future.

Operational Agreements

All of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management agreements or operating and license agreements (See
“—Operating Structure”). As of December 31, 2010, 25 of our hotels are operated by Starwood or other managers pursuant to operating and license agreements, while our remaining hotels are operated pursuant to management
agreements, the provisions of which are described in more detail below. Under these agreements, the managers or operators generally have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the day-to-day operation of the
hotels, including establishing all room rates, processing reservations, procuring inventories, supplies and services, providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers’ technical and operational experts and
promoting and publicizing the hotels. The manager or operator provides all managerial and other employees for the hotels, reviews the operation and maintenance of the hotels, prepares reports, budgets and projections, and provides other
administrative and accounting support services to the hotels. These support services include planning and policy services, financial planning, divisional financial services, product planning and development, employee staffing and training, corporate
executive management and certain in-house legal services. For the majority of our properties, we have approval rights over the budget, capital expenditures and other matters.

Management Agreements

.

Our management agreements, which include the agreements for our hotels managed by Marriott, typically include the terms described below:

•

Term and fees for operational services

. The initial term of our management agreements generally is 15 to 20 years, with one or more renewal
terms at the option of the manager. The manager receives compensation in the form of a base management fee, which is calculated as a percentage (typically 2-3%) of annual gross revenues, and an incentive management fee, which is typically calculated
as a percentage (generally 10-20%) of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel.



•

Chain services

. Managers are required to provide chain services that are generally furnished on a centralized basis. Such services include:
(1) the development and operation of certain computer systems and reservation services, (2) regional management and administrative services, regional marketing and sales services, regional training services, manpower development and
relocation of regional personnel, and (3) such additional central or regional services as may from time to time be more efficiently performed on a regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis. Costs and expenses incurred in
providing these services are generally allocated among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates that benefit from these services.

•

Working capital and fixed asset supplies

. We are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed
asset supplies (for example, linen, china, glassware, silver and uniforms). We also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from hotel operations are insufficient to meet the
financial requirements of the hotels.

•

Furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements

. We are required to provide the managers with all necessary furniture, fixtures and
equipment for the operation of the hotels (including funding any required furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements). On an annual basis, the manager will prepare a list of furniture, fixtures and equipment to be acquired and certain routine
repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the funds that are necessary, which is subject to our review and approval. For purposes of funding the furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements, a specified percentage
(typically 5%) of the gross revenues of the hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow account in our name, to which the manager has access. However, for 62 of our hotels, we have entered into an agreement with Marriott International, Inc. to
allow us to fund such expenditures directly as incurred from one account that we control, subject to maintaining a minimum balance of the greater of $35.8 million, or 30% of total annual specified contributions, rather than escrowing funds into
accounts at each hotel.

•

Building alterations, improvements and renewals

. The managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for
major repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals and replacements to the structural, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and elevators of each hotel, which we review and approve based on their recommendations
and our judgment. In addition to the foregoing, the manager may propose such changes, alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required, in the manager’s reasonable judgment, to keep the hotel in a competitive, efficient and economical
operating condition, consistent with the manager’s brand standards. We generally have approval authority over such changes, alterations and improvements.

•

Service marks

. During the term of the management agreements, the brand name, service mark, symbols and logos used by the manager may be
used in the operation of the hotel. Any right to use the brand name, service marks, logos and symbols and related trademarks at a hotel will terminate with respect to that hotel upon termination of the applicable management or franchise agreement.

•

Sale of the hotel.

We are generally limited in our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the hotels by requiring that the transferee
assume the related management agreements and meet specified other conditions, including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager.

•

Termination on sale

. While most of our management agreements are not terminable prior to their full term, we have negotiated termination
rights with respect to 18 specified Marriott-branded hotels in connection with the sale of these hotels subject to certain limitations, including the number of agreements that can be terminated per year, limitations measured by EBITDA and
limitations requiring that a significant part of such hotels maintain the Marriott brand affiliation. The described termination rights may be exercised without payment of a termination fee, except for one of the specified hotels, wherein a
termination fee is required if it does not maintain the Marriott brand affiliation.

•

Performance termination

. We generally have termination rights in the case of a manager’s prolonged failure to meet certain financial
performance criteria, usually a set return on the owners’ investment. We



have agreed in the past, and may agree in the future, to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for consideration from the hotel manager, which consideration could take the form of
cash compensation or amendments to the management agreement. Similarly, the majority of our management agreements condition the manager’s right to renew pre-determined extension terms to the satisfaction of certain financial performance
criteria.

Operating and License Agreements.

Our operating and license agreements with Starwood
(the operator with which we have the vast majority of these agreements) typically include the terms described below:

•

Term and fees for operational services

. The initial term of our operating agreements is 20 years, with two renewal terms of 10 years each
at the option of the operator. The operator receives compensation in the form of a base fee of 1% of annual gross operating revenues and an incentive fee of 20% of annual gross operating profit, after the owner has received a priority return of
10.75% on its purchase price and other investments in the hotels.

•

License services

. The license agreements address matters relating to the subject brand, including rights to use service marks, logos,
symbols and trademarks, such as those associated with Westin

®

, Sheraton

®

and W

®

, as well as matters relating to compliance with certain standards and policies and (including through other agreements in the case of certain hotels) the provision of
certain system program and centralized services. The license agreements have an initial term of 20 years each, with two renewal terms of 10 years each at the option of the licensor. Licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees of 5% of
gross operating revenue attributable to room sales and 2% of gross operating revenue attributable to food and beverage sales.

•

Programs and services

. The licensor or operator provides certain system programs and services to all or substantially all of our Starwood
hotels by brand in a licensed area. Such services include participation in reservation services and the marketing program, as well as the Starwood Preferred Guest Program. In addition to these services, under the operating agreements, centralized
operating services are furnished to hotels by brand on a system basis. Costs and expenses incurred in providing such system programs and services and centralized operating services under the license and operating agreements or other agreements are
fairly allocated among all hotels in the applicable brand operated or licensed by Starwood or its affiliates.

•

Working capital and fixed asset supplies

. We are required to maintain working capital funds for each hotel in order to fund the cost of
certain fixed asset supplies and to meet the ongoing cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from hotel operations are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels. For 18 of our hotels, the working
capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by Starwood operators for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis, with operators being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect
to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the operating agreements.

•

Furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements

. We are required to provide all necessary furniture, fixtures and equipment for the
operation of the hotels (including funding for any required furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements). To fund these items each month, the operator transfers into a reserve fund account an amount equal to 5% of the gross operating revenue of a
hotel for the previous month. For 17 of our hotels, the periodic reserve fund contributions, which would otherwise be deposited into reserve fund accounts maintained by operators for each hotel, are distributed to us, and we are responsible for
providing funding of expenditures which would otherwise be funded from the reserve funds for each of the subject hotels as such expenditures become necessary. In addition to routine capital expenditures, the reserve funds for the hotels also may be
used for building capital improvements. Any approved reserve funding in excess of amounts available in the pooled reserve funds is funded by us and results in appropriate increases of owner’s investment and owner’s priority amounts. For 17
hotels, the amount of any such additional reserve funding will be allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis, determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all hotels for the most
recent operating year. Any such additional reserve funding will result in corresponding increases in the owner’s investment and owner’s priority amounts with respect to each of such hotels.



•

Building alterations, improvements and renewals

. The operators are required to prepare an annual operating plan that includes an estimate
of the expenditures necessary for maintenance, repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals and replacements to the structural, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and elevators of each hotel, which plan and
proposed expenditures we review and approve based on the operator’s recommendations and our judgment.

•

Territorial

. The operating agreements provide area restrictions for a period of either five or 10 years, which limit the operator and its
affiliates from owning, operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand in the area. The area restrictions vary with each hotel, from city blocks in urban areas to up to a 10-mile radius from the hotel in other areas.

•

Sale of the hotel/other

. We are limited in our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the hotels under the license agreements.
Generally, the agreements require that the transferee assume the related operating agreement and meet specified other conditions, including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the licensor. The operating agreements provide for
termination rights beginning in 2016 in the case of the operator’s failure to meet certain financial performance criteria. Generally, such rights arise in the event that the operator fails, for two consecutive years, to generate operating
profit equal to or greater than a specified percentage of the owner’s investment in the hotel, and the RevPAR performance of the hotel falls below that of other competitive hotels in the market during such two-year period.

•

Termination on sale

. As of December 31, 2010, we have termination rights relating to the operating agreements on ten specified hotels
upon the sale of those hotels. Such termination rights are currently active with respect to one such hotel. With respect to nine of the ten specified hotels, we have the right beginning in 2016 to sell 35% of such hotels (measured by EBITDA), not to
exceed two hotels annually, free and clear of the existing operating agreement over a period of time without the payment of a termination fee. With respect to any termination of an operating agreement on sale, the proposed purchaser would need to
meet the requirements for transfer under the applicable license agreement.

•

International hotel.

The operating and license agreements with Starwood for one of our international hotels provide for similar services as
noted above, however the term is for 15 years, with no renewal option, and calls for a combined base and license fee equal to three percent of total revenues.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we had 203 employees, including
187 at our Bethesda, Maryland office, five at our London, England office, three at our Amsterdam, The Netherlands office and eight at our Republic of Singapore office. Employees at our consolidated hotels are employed by the operators that manage
our hotels.

None of our direct employees as of December 31, 2010 are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
However, employees at certain of our third-party managed hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to review and renewal on a regular basis. For a discussion of these relationships see “Risk Factors—We are
subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.”



Item 1A. Risk Factors

The statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. In addition, these statements
constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Financial Risks and Risks of Operation

Our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry.

The lodging industry is subject to changes in the travel patterns of business and leisure travelers, both of which are affected by the
strength of the economy as well as other factors. Changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term and adversely affect our results. During the recession in 2008 and 2009,
overall travel was reduced, which had a significant effect on our results of operations. While operating results improved during 2010, uncertainty in the strength and direction of the recovery and continued high unemployment have hampered the pace
of the overall economic recovery. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated growth in the
economy and changes in travel patterns. Our results of operations and any forecast we make, may be affected and can change based on the following risks affecting the lodging industry:

•

changes in the international, national, regional and local economic climate;

•

changes in business and leisure travel patterns;

•

the effect of terrorist attacks and terror alerts in the United States and internationally, as well as other geopolitical disturbances;

•

supply growth in markets where we own hotels, which may adversely affect demand at our properties;

•

the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to competing hotels;

•

the performance of the managers of our hotels;

•

outbreaks of disease;

•

changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors; and

•

unionization of the labor force at our hotels.

A reduction in our revenue or earnings as a result of the above risks may reduce our working capital, impact our long-term business strategy, and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet
certain covenants in our existing debt agreements.

Disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our business and results
of operations, our ability to obtain financing on reasonable and acceptable terms, and our ability to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.

The United States and global equity and credit markets experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions in 2008 and 2009, all of which caused market prices of the stocks of
many companies to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective and outstanding debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances impacted liquidity in the financial markets, which made terms for financings less attractive, and, in
some cases, resulted in the lack of availability of certain types of financing. While conditions in the credit markets have improved, a subsequent prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of
potentially less attractive financing and may negatively impact our ability to enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Disruptions in the financial
markets also may adversely affect our credit rating, the market value of Host Inc.’s common stock, and the value of Host L.P.’s OP units. While we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity with which to meet our anticipated
requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, if our operating results worsen significantly and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly,
we could face liquidity problems that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.



Economic conditions may adversely affect the value of our hotels, which may result in impairment
charges on our properties.

We analyze our assets for impairment in several situations, including when a property has
current or projected losses from operations, when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when other material trends, contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that
a triggering event has occurred, such that an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. For impaired assets, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the property’s carrying value over its fair value. We did not record
any impairment charges in 2010, but could in the future, which will negatively affect our results of operations. We can provide no assurance that any impairment loss recognized would not be material to our results of operations. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies.”

We depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be unable to access capital when necessary.

Unlike regular C corporations, we must finance our growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because Host
Inc. is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gain) in order to qualify as a REIT, including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which it does
not receive cash. Funds used by Host Inc. to make required distributions are provided through distributions from Host L.P. Our ability to access external capital could be hampered by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control,
including credit market conditions, unfavorable market perception of our growth potential, decreases in our current and estimated future earnings, or decreases in the market price of Host Inc.’s common stock. Our ability to access additional
capital also may be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness which, under certain circumstances, restrict our incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and Host L.P. distributions. The occurrence of any of these factors, individually
or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain external capital on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth.

We have substantial debt and may incur additional debt.

As of December 31, 2010, we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately $5.5 billion. Our substantial indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow
from operations to debt service payments, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs. Additionally, our substantial
indebtedness could:

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;

•

limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or to obtain financing for expenditures, acquisitions, development or other
general corporate needs on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all; or

•

affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions.

If our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness, we will have to raise
additional funds through:

•

sales of our OP units;

•

the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by Host L.P.; or

•

the sale of our assets.

We cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or, if available, will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations
or fulfill our business plan. Under certain circumstances we would be required to use the cash from some of the events described above to repay other indebtedness.



The terms of our debt place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and these restrictions reduce our
operational flexibility and create default risks.

The documents governing the terms of our existing senior notes and
our credit facility contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to:

•

conduct acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, unless the successor entity in such transaction assumes our indebtedness;

•

incur additional debt in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics;

•

create liens securing indebtedness, unless an effective provision is made to secure our other indebtedness by such liens;

•

sell assets without using the proceeds from such sales for certain permitted uses or to make an offer to repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness;

•

make capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds;

•

make distributions without satisfying certain financial metrics; and

•

conduct transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s length basis and, in certain instances, without obtaining opinions as to the fairness
of such transactions.

Certain covenants also require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial performance
tests. If we fail to meet such tests, the restrictive covenants in the applicable indenture(s), the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt (including our mortgage debt) will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and
will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all
or a substantial portion of our debt. For a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Financial Condition.”

Our ability to pay dividends and to make distributions may be limited or prohibited by the
terms of our indebtedness or preferred units.

We are, and may in the future become, party to agreements and
instruments that restrict or prevent the payment of dividends on classes and series of Host Inc. capital stock and Host L.P.’s payment of distributions on its classes of units. Under the terms of Host L.P.’s credit facility and senior
notes indenture, distributions to Host Inc. by Host L.P., upon which Host Inc. depends in order to obtain the cash necessary to pay dividends, and distributions by Host L.P. to other unitholders are permitted only to the extent that, at the time of
the distribution, Host L.P. can satisfy certain financial covenant tests (concerning leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage) and meet other requirements.

Under the terms of Host L.P.’s outstanding preferred OP units, we are not permitted to make distributions on our common OP units
unless all cumulative distributions have been paid (or funds for payment have been set aside for payment) on our preferred OP units. In the event that we fail to pay the accrued distributions on our preferred OP units for any reason, including any
restriction on making such distributions under the terms of our debt instruments (as discussed above), distributions will continue to accrue on such preferred OP units and we will be prohibited from making any distributions on our common OP units
until all such accrued but unpaid distributions on our preferred OP units have been paid (or funds for such payment have been set aside).

Defaulting on our mortgage debt could adversely affect our business.

As of December 31, 2010, 11 of our hotels and assets related thereto are subject to mortgages in an aggregate amount of
approximately $1.0 billion. Although the debt is generally non-recourse to us, if these hotels do not produce adequate cash flow to service the debt secured by such mortgages, the mortgage lenders could call a default on these assets.
Generally, we would expect to negotiate with the lender prior to the occurrence of a default to pursue other options, such as a deed in lieu of foreclosure. However, we may opt to allow such default to occur rather than make the necessary mortgage
payments with funds from other sources. Our senior notes indenture and credit facility contain cross-default provisions, which, depending upon the amount of secured debt in default, could



cause a cross-default under both of these agreements. Our credit facility, which contains a more restrictive cross-default provision than the senior notes indenture, provides that a credit
facility default will occur in the event that we default on non-recourse secured indebtedness in excess of 1% (or approximately $158 million as of December 31, 2010) of our total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values). For
this and other reasons, permitting a default could adversely affect our long-term business prospects.

Our mortgage debt contains
provisions that may reduce our liquidity.

Certain of our mortgage debt requires that, to the extent cash flow from
the hotels which secure such debt drops below stated levels, we escrow cash flow after the payment of debt service until operations improve above the stated levels. In some cases, the lender has the right under certain circumstances to apply the
escrowed amount to the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt. If such provisions are triggered, there can be no assurance that the affected properties will achieve the minimum cash flow levels required to trigger a release of any escrowed funds.
The amounts required to be escrowed may negatively affect our liquidity by limiting our access to cash flow after debt service from these mortgaged properties.

An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets.

Interest payments for borrowings on our credit facility and certain mortgages on our properties, as well as
fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that we have entered into are based on floating rates. As a result, an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes, including investments in our portfolio.
Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced. We may from time to time enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors
and other interest rate hedging contracts. While these agreements may lessen the impact of rising interest rates, they also expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable. In
addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to dispose of assets.

Rating agency downgrades may increase our cost of capital.

Our
senior notes are rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings. These independent rating agencies may elect to downgrade their ratings on our senior notes at any time. Such downgrades may
negatively affect our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of capital.

Our expenses may not decrease if our revenue
decreases.

Many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels, such as debt-service payments, property
taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the hotels. Our expenses also will be affected by inflationary increases, and certain
costs, such as wages, benefits and insurance, may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. In the event of a significant decrease in demand, we may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits.
Our managers also may be unable to offset any such increased expenses with higher room rates. Any of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures also could adversely affect the future growth of our
business and the value of our hotel properties.

Our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business,
liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.

As part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire
luxury and upper upscale hotel properties. We may acquire properties through various structures, including transactions involving portfolios, single assets, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of
other REITs or similar real estate entities. We anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods, including proceeds from Host Inc. equity offerings, issuance of limited partnership interests of Host L.P., advances
under our credit facility, the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sales of assets. Disruptions in credit markets may limit our ability to finance acquisitions and may limit the ability of purchasers to finance hotels and
adversely affect our disposition strategy and our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance acquisitions.



We may, from time to time, be in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating
possible acquisition transactions. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions. Our inability to
consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms, or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations,
including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities.

We do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels.

Our cash flow from our hotels may be adversely affected if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name. While we
monitor the hotel managers’ performance, we have limited recourse under our management agreements if the hotel managers are not performing adequately. In addition, from time to time, we have had, and continue to have, differences with the
managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements. We generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations. However, if we are unable to reach satisfactory results
through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third-party dispute resolution. Failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements could adversely
affect our results of operations. Our hotel managers or their affiliates manage, and in some cases own, have invested in, or provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our hotels, all of which may result in conflicts
of interest. As a result, our hotel managers have in the past made, and may in the future make, decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest.

We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.

We have entered into management agreements with third-party managers to operate our hotel properties. Our third-party
managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. Although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels (other than our New Zealand properties), we are still subject to many of the
costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly those hotels with unionized labor. From time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions
and publicity. We also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes or other events. Additionally, hotels where our managers have collective bargaining agreements with employees (approximately 21% of our
current portfolio by revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010) are more highly affected by labor force activities than others. The resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, either by
increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. Furthermore, labor agreements may limit the ability of our managers to reduce the size of hotel workforces during an economic downturn because collective
bargaining agreements are negotiated between the managers of our hotels and labor unions. We do not have the ability to control the outcome of these negotiations.

Our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace, maintain brand standards or to comply with
applicable laws or regulations. The timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments.

In addition to capital expenditures required by our loan agreements or agreements with our hotel managers, we will need to make capital
expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels, to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance, particularly if the
improvements require closures of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels, such as ballrooms, meeting space and restaurants. These capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost
overruns and delays. In addition, because we depend



on external sources of capital, we may not have the necessary funds to invest and, if we fail to maintain our properties in accordance with brand standards set by our managers, the manager may
terminate the management agreement. Moreover, we may not necessarily realize a significant, or any, improvement in the performance of the hotels in which we make these investments.

The ownership of hotels outside the United States and the expansion of our business into new markets outside of the United States will expose us to risks relating to owning hotels in those
international markets.

Part of our business strategy is to expand our presence internationally. As of
December 31, 2010, we directly own nine hotels located outside the United States. Subsequent to year end, we acquired seven hotels in New Zealand. We are also party to a joint venture that owns 11 hotels in Europe and own a 25% interest in an
Asian joint venture that currently does not own any hotels. However, our Asian joint venture has reached an agreement to develop seven properties in India in a joint venture with Accor S.A. and InterGlobe Enterprises Limited. We may have difficulty
managing our expansion into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy, an absence of business relationships in the area, or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures and
regulations. There are risks inherent in conducting business internationally, which include:

•

employment laws and practices;

•

tax laws, which may provide for income or other taxes or tax rates that exceed those of the U.S. and which may provide that foreign earnings that are
repatriated, directly or indirectly, are subject to dividend withholding requirements or other restrictions;

•

compliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy;

•

the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability, cost and terms of such financing;

•

adverse changes in local, political, economic and market conditions;

•

insurance coverage related to terrorist events;

•

changes in interest rates and/or currency exchange rates;

•

regulations regarding the incurrence of debt; and

•

difficulties in complying with U.S. rules governing REITs while operating internationally.

Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international expansion. If we do
not effectively manage our geographic expansion and successfully integrate the foreign hotels into our organization, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.

We may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts.

We have made a significant investment in a European joint venture which owns 11 hotels in Europe and are exploring investment opportunities throughout Asia through our Asian joint venture. We may, from
time to time, invest as a co-venturer in other entities holding hotel properties instead of purchasing hotel properties directly. Co-venturers often share control over the operation of a joint venture. Actions by a co-venturer could subject the
assets to additional risk as a result of any of the following circumstances:

•

our co-venturer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our, or the joint venture’s, interests or goals; or

•

our co-venturer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives.

Although we generally will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture in order to permit our
objectives to be achieved, we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners.

Our management
agreements could affect the sale or financing of our hotels.

Under the terms of our management agreements, we
generally may not sell, lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management



agreements and meets specified other conditions. Our ability to finance or sell our properties, depending upon the structure of such transactions, may require the manager’s consent. If the
manager does not consent to such sale or financing, we may be precluded from taking actions in our best interest.

Future terrorist
attacks or changes in terror alert levels could adversely affect us.

Previous terrorist attacks in the United States
and subsequent terrorist alerts have adversely affected the travel and hospitality industries in recent years. The impact that terrorist attacks in the United States or elsewhere could have on domestic and international markets and our business in
particular is indeterminable, but it is possible that such attacks or the threat of such attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to finance our business, our ability to insure our properties and/or our results of
operations and financial condition as a whole.

We may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance for losses
caused by some types of terrorist acts, and federal terrorism legislation does not ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future.

We obtain terrorism insurance as part of our all-risk property insurance program, as well as our general liability and directors’
and officers’ coverage. However, our all-risk policies have limitations, such as per occurrence limits, annual aggregate coverage limits and sublimits, all of which might have to be shared proportionally across participating hotels under
certain loss scenarios. Also, all-risk insurers only have to provide terrorism coverage to the extent mandated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (“TRIPRA”). Property damage related to war and to nuclear,
radiological, biological and chemical incidents is excluded under our policies. While TRIPRA will reimburse insurers for losses resulting from nuclear, radiological, biological and chemical perils, TRIPRA does not require insurers to offer coverage
for these perils and, to date, insurers are not willing to provide this coverage, even with government reinsurance. We have a wholly-owned captive insurance company through which we obtain a policy of nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological
(“NBCR”) coverage. This captive insurer has the same ability as other insurance companies to apply to the U.S. Treasury for reimbursement, as provided for in TRIPRA, and is subject to the same deductibles and co-insurance obligations. This
potential reimbursement applies to property insurance only, and not to general liability or directors’ and officers’ insurance, and there are no assurances that we will be able to recover any or all of our NCBR losses under this program.

We may be unable to satisfy the insurance requirements of our lenders.

Certain of our mortgage debt agreements for our properties and properties held by our European joint venture require us to maintain
property insurance provided by carriers maintaining minimum ratings from Standard & Poor’s, A.M. Best or other rating agencies. Several of our mortgages contain requirements for the financial strength of insurers to be rated as high as
AA by Standard & Poor’s. Due to upheavals in the financial markets, the number of insurers that carry that rating has been decreasing for a number of years. In 2009, and again in 2010, in all cases where our insurance carriers did not
meet the minimum financial strength requirements, we were able to obtain waivers from the lenders or they have provided written assurances that they are satisfied with the makeup of our pool of insurance providers. We cannot provide assurances that
each of our lenders will continue to be satisfied with our insurance coverage, or with the rating levels of our carriers, or that our carriers will not be downgraded further. If any of these lenders becomes dissatisfied with our insurance coverage
or the ratings of our insurance carriers, they may, on our behalf, elect to procure additional property insurance coverage that meets their ratings requirements. The cost of such additional property insurance would be borne by the property or
properties securing the loans. Also, the premiums associated with such coverage may be considerably higher than those associated with our current insurance coverage.

Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.

We, or our
hotel managers, carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties. These policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we
believe are customary for similar types of properties. Generally, our “all-risk” property policies provide coverage that is available on a per-occurrence basis and that, for each occurrence, has an overall limit, as well as various
sub-limits, on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive. Sub-limits exist for certain types of claims, such as service interruption, debris removal, expediting costs, landscaping replacement and



natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes, and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits. The dollar amounts of these sub-limits are significantly lower than the
dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit. In this regard, hotels in certain of our markets, including California and Florida, have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters. Recovery under the
applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income. There is no assurance that this insurance, where maintained, will fully fund the re-building or restoration of a hotel that is impacted
by an earthquake, hurricane, or other natural disaster, or the income lost as a result of the damage. Our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined
together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub-limits contained in our policies have been exceeded and, in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage, any such claims will be combined with the
claims of other owners participating in the manager’s program for the same purpose. Therefore, if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels, or, in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the management
company, affects hotels owned by others, the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. Each affected hotel may only receive a
proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available. We may incur losses in excess of insured limits and, as a result, we may be even less likely
to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or certain types of terrorism.

In addition, there are other risks, such as certain environmental hazards, that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive
to justify coverage. We also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy. Should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur,
or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier, we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel. In that event, we might nevertheless
remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property.

Litigation judgments or settlements
could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition.

On February 8, 2010, we received an adverse
jury verdict in a trial in the 166th Judicial District Court of Bexar County, Texas involving the sale of land encumbered by a ground lease for the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter. On June 3, 2010, the trial court entered its final judgment,
reciting and incorporating the jury’s verdict. On August 26, 2010, we filed our notice of appeal. See “Legal Proceedings” for more information on the verdict and see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Other Income Statement Line Items” for a discussion of the litigation accrual.

We also are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business and are vigorously defending these claims;
however, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. We believe, based on currently available information, that the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.

We also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels, individuals or companies who use our hotels, our investors, our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these
claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and performance.

We may be subject to unknown or contingent
liabilities related to hotels or businesses we acquire.

Assets and entities that we have acquired, or may in the
future acquire, may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse, or only limited recourse, against the sellers. In general, the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements may not
survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and seek recourse against our sellers. While we usually require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive, such indemnification
is often limited and subject to various materiality thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses. As a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of
their representations and warranties. The total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to



liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations, plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects, all of which may adversely affect our revenues,
expenses, operating results and financial condition. Finally, indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us.
While the sellers are generally contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations, materiality thresholds, deductibles or caps on losses, there can be no
guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses in addition to those incurred by the sellers.

We
depend on our key personnel.

Our success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel.
None of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers. We cannot assure you that these key personnel will remain employed by us. While we believe that we could find
replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance.

Exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results.

As a result of the expansion of our international operations, currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations
and financial position. We expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso, the British Pound, Polish Zloty, the Brazilian Real and the Chilean Peso.
In 2010, these currencies represented 4% of our revenues. Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions and/or obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of
these and other foreign currencies, these transactions, if entered into, will not eliminate that risk entirely. To the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in the same currency, exchange rate
fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies, the
conversion of such amounts into U.S. Dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our revenues or earnings.

Applicable REIT laws may restrict certain business activities.

As a REIT, Host Inc. is subject to various restrictions on the types of income it can earn, assets it can own and activities in which it can engage. Business activities that could be impacted by
applicable REIT laws include, but are not limited to, activities such as developing alternative uses of real estate, including the development and/or sale of timeshare or condominium units. Due to these restrictions, we anticipate that we will
conduct certain business activities, including those mentioned above, in one or more of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries are taxable as regular C corporations and are subject to federal, state, local, and, if applicable,
foreign taxation on their taxable income.

We may be unable to sell properties because real estate investments are inherently illiquid.

Real estate properties generally cannot be sold quickly and, accordingly, we may not be able to vary our portfolio
promptly in response to economic or other conditions. The inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to service our debt. In addition, under the
federal income tax laws applicable to REITs, we may be limited in our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets.

Our ground lease payments may increase faster than the revenues we receive on the hotels situated on the leased properties.

As of December 31, 2010, 36 of our hotels are subject to third-party ground leases (encumbering all or a portion of the hotel).
These ground leases generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments, which payments are often based on economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index. Our ability to pay ground rent could be adversely affected to the extent that
our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases. In addition, if we were to sell a hotel encumbered by a ground lease, the buyer would have to assume the ground lease,
which may result in a lower sales price.



Environmental problems are possible and can be costly.

We believe that our properties comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws. Unidentified environmental liabilities
could arise, however, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or
operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property. The owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, and for
investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the
contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or
operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings
containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed
during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal
injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.

Compliance with other government regulations can be costly.

Our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, building codes
and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. These laws and regulations may be changed from time-to-time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in
additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. Any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Risks of Ownership of Host Inc.’s Common Stock

There are limitations on the
acquisition of Host Inc. common stock and changes in control.

Host Inc.’s charter and bylaws, the partnership
agreement of Host L.P., and the Maryland General Corporation Law contain a number of provisions, the exercise or existence of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for Host
Inc.’s stockholders or Host L.P.’s unitholders or otherwise be in their best interests, including the following:

•

Restrictions on transfer and ownership of Host Inc.’s stock.

To maintain Host Inc.’s qualification as a REIT for federal income
tax purposes, among other purposes, not more than 50% in value of Host Inc.’s outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned in the last half of the taxable year, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, which, as defined in the
Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), may include certain entities. Because such ownership could jeopardize Host Inc.’s qualification as a REIT, a person cannot own, directly or by attribution, 10% or more of an interest in a Host Inc.
lessee, nor can a Host Inc. lessee of any partnership in which Host Inc. is a partner own, directly or by attribution, 10% or more of Host Inc.’s shares, in each case unless exempted by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors.

Host Inc.’s charter prohibits ownership, directly or by attribution, by any person or persons acting as
a group, of more than 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of shares of Host Inc.’s outstanding common stock, preferred stock or any other class or series of stock, each considered as a separate class or series for this
purpose. Together, these limitations are referred to as the “ownership limit.”



Stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the intended acquiror of the
stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon, to vote those shares of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or
the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares of Host Inc.’s stock to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances, and, in any event, would deny that person any of
the economic benefits of owning shares of Host Inc.’s stock in excess of the ownership limit. These restrictions on transfer and ownership will not apply if Host Inc.’s Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in Host Inc.’s
best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with the restrictions on transfer and ownership is no longer required for Host Inc. to qualify as a REIT.

•

Removal of Board of Directors.

Host Inc.’s charter provides that, except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or
series of shares of capital stock other than common stock, directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.
Vacancies on Host Inc.’s Board of Directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of the remaining directors (except that a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire Board of
Directors) and, in the case of a vacancy resulting from the removal of a director, by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.

•

Preferred shares; classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval.

Host Inc.’s
charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that Host Inc. has authority to issue is 1,100,000,000, consisting of 1,050,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Host Inc.’s Board of
Directors has the authority, without a vote of stockholders, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock, including common stock into preferred stock or vice versa, and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred or other
class or series of shares to be issued. Because Host Inc.’s Board of Directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of additional classes or series of stock without a stockholder vote, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors may
give the holders of any class or series of stock preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of existing stock.

•

Maryland business combination law.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, specified “business combinations,” including
specified issuances of equity securities, between a Maryland corporation and any person who owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation’s then outstanding shares, or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time
during the two year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the corporation (each, an “interested stockholder”), or an affiliate of the interested
stockholder, are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Thereafter, any of these specified business combinations must be approved by 80% of the votes entitled to be
cast by the holders of outstanding voting shares and by two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of voting shares other than voting shares held by the interested stockholder unless, among other conditions, the corporation’s
common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined in the Maryland General Corporation Law, for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder. As a Maryland
corporation which has not opted out of these provisions, Host Inc. is subject to the Maryland business combination statute. The statute provides various exemptions from its provisions, including for business combinations that are exempted by the
board of directors before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. The Board of Directors has not granted any such exceptions at this time.

•

Maryland control share acquisition law.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, “control shares” acquired in a “control
share acquisition” have no voting rights, except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquiror, by officers or by directors who are
employees of the corporation. “Control shares” are voting shares which, if aggregated with all other voting shares owned by the acquiror or over which the



acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors
within one of the following ranges of voting power: (1) one-tenth or more but less than one-third, (2) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (3) a majority or more of the voting power. Control shares do not include shares the
acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares, subject to specified exceptions. Our bylaws contain a
provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law. There can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the
future.

Merger, consolidation, share exchange and transfer of Host Inc.’s assets.

Under Maryland law and Host Inc.’s charter, subject to
the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock, we can merge with or into another entity, consolidate with one or more other entities, participate in a share exchange or transfer Host Inc.’s assets within the meaning of the
Maryland General Corporation Law if approved (1) by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors in the manner provided in the Maryland General Corporation Law, and (2) by Host Inc.’s stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled
to be cast on the matter, except that any merger of Host Inc. with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing Host Inc.’s form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires only the approval of Host Inc.’s stockholders
holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange is only required to be approved by the board of
directors of a Maryland corporation if the corporation is the successor entity. Host Inc.’s voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.

•

Certain charter and bylaw amendments.

Host Inc.’s charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and ownership of
Host Inc.’s stock, fixing the size of the Board of Directors within the range set forth in the charter, removal of directors, the filling of vacancies, exculpation and indemnification of directors, calling special stockholder meetings and
others, all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by Host Inc.’s stockholders holding two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Other charter amendments generally require
approval of the Board and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. As permitted under the Maryland General Corporation Law, Host Inc.’s charter and bylaws provide that the Board of Directors
have the exclusive right to amend Host Inc.’s bylaws. These provisions may make it more difficult to amend Host Inc.’s charter and bylaws to alter the provisions described herein that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change
in control or the acquisition of Host Inc. common stock, without the approval of the Board of Directors.

Shares of
Host Inc.’s common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of Host Inc.’s common stock.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of Host Inc.’s common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for Host Inc.’s common stock. In
addition, holders of OP units who redeem their units and receive, at Host Inc.’s election, shares of Host Inc. common stock will be able to sell those shares freely. As of December 31, 2010, there are approximately 10.5 million OP
units outstanding that are redeemable. Further, a substantial number of shares of Host Inc.’s common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans. We maintain two stock-based
compensation plans: (i) the comprehensive stock plan, whereby we may award to participating employees and directors restricted shares of common stock, options to purchase common stock and deferred shares of common stock, and (ii) an
employee stock purchase plan. At December 31, 2010, there were approximately 19.2 million shares of Host Inc.’s common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan, and there were 3.7 million
shares of Host Inc.’s restricted stock outstanding and 0.9 million outstanding options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $7.14 per share.

Also as of December 31, 2010, Host L.P. had outstanding $1,251 million principal amount of exchangeable senior debentures that could become exchangeable under certain conditions for shares of
Host Inc.’s common stock. The principal portion for $526 million face amount of such exchangeable debentures is cash settled, and therefore no



shares would be issued, unless Host Inc.’s share price exceeded the exchange rate for this series of debentures of $31.23 as of December 31, 2010. For another $400 million of such
exchangeable debentures, Host Inc. has the option to issue cash, shares of Host Inc.’s common stock or any combination thereof in settlement of the debentures, should they be presented for exchange.

On August 19, 2010, Host Inc. entered into a Sales Agency Financing Agreement with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, through which
Host Inc. may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $400 million. The sales will be made in “at the market” offerings under SEC rules, including sales made directly on the New
York Stock Exchange. BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC is acting as sales agent. As of December 31, 2010, $300 million in shares of Host Inc.’s common stock have been issued and sold pursuant to the program. Shares of Host Inc.’s
common stock, having an aggregate offering price of approximately $100 million, remain issuable from time to time under the agreement. Any additional shares of common stock issued by Host Inc., whether issued under this program or otherwise,
would be available in the future for sale in the public markets.

Our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of
shares of Host Inc.’s common stock.

We believe that the market value of a REIT’s equity securities is based
primarily upon the market’s perception of the REIT’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, whether from operations, sales, acquisitions, development or refinancings, and is secondarily based upon the
value of the underlying assets. For that reason, shares of Host Inc.’s common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes,
working capital reserves or other purposes, rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may negatively impact the market price of Host Inc.’s common stock.
Our failure to meet the market’s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of Host Inc.’s common stock.

Market interest rates may affect the price of shares of Host Inc.’s common stock.

We believe that one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a REIT is the dividend rate on the shares, considered as a percentage of the price of the
shares, relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of REIT shares may expect a higher dividend rate. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of Host Inc.’s common stock
to decrease.

Federal Income Tax Risks

To qualify as a REIT, each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, regardless of available cash or
outstanding obligations.

To continue to qualify as a REIT, Host Inc. is required to distribute to its stockholders
with respect to each year at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain. To the extent that Host Inc. satisfies this distribution requirement, but distributes less than 100% of its taxable income and net capital gain for the taxable
year, it will be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income and net capital gain. In addition, Host Inc. will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions made
by Host Inc. with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of its ordinary income, (2) 95% of its net capital gain, and (3) any undistributed taxable income from prior years, less excess distributions from prior
years. Host Inc. intends to make distributions, subject to the availability of cash and in compliance with any debt covenants, to its stockholders in order to comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid the imposition of a significant
nondeductible 4% excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from Host L.P. and its subsidiaries. There are differences in timing between Host Inc.’s recognition of taxable income and its receipt of cash available for
distribution due to, among other things, the seasonality of the lodging industry and the fact that some taxable income will be “phantom” taxable income, which is taxable income that is not matched by cash flow. Due to transactions entered
into in years prior to Host Inc.’s conversion to a REIT, Host Inc. could recognize substantial amounts of “phantom” taxable income in the future. It is possible that any differences between the recognition of taxable income and the
receipt of the related cash could require us to borrow funds or for Host Inc. to issue additional equity in order to enable Host Inc. to meet its distribution requirements and, therefore,



to maintain its REIT status and to avoid the nondeductible 4% excise tax. In addition, because the REIT distribution requirements prevent Host Inc. from retaining earnings, we generally will be
required to refinance debt at its maturity with additional debt or equity. It is possible that any of these sources of funds, if available at all, would not be sufficient to meet Host Inc.’s distribution and tax obligations.

Host L.P. owns 100% of the outstanding common stock and a portion of the outstanding preferred stock of two entities that have elected to
be treated as REITs. Each of these subsidiary REITs will be subject to the same requirements that Host Inc. must satisfy in order to qualify as a REIT, including the distribution requirements described above.

Adverse tax consequences would occur if Host Inc. or any of its subsidiary REITs fail to qualify as a REIT.

We believe that Host Inc. has been organized and has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a REIT under the Code, commencing with
its taxable year beginning January 1, 1999, and Host Inc. currently intends to continue to operate as a REIT during future years. In addition, Host Inc. owns, through Host L.P., two entities that have elected to be treated as REITs. As the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a REIT are limited, no assurance can be provided that Host Inc. currently
qualifies as a REIT or will continue to qualify as a REIT or that each of Host Inc.’s subsidiary REITs qualify as a REIT. If any of the subsidiary REITs were to fail to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that Host Inc. would fail to qualify as a
REIT unless it (or the subsidiary REIT) could avail itself of certain relief provisions. New legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to an
entity’s qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of its REIT qualification. If Host Inc. or any of the subsidiary REITs were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and any available relief provisions did not apply, the
non-qualifying REIT would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax,
on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. Moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying REIT would not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification was lost.

Any determination that Host Inc. or one of its subsidiary REITs does not qualify as a REIT will have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and could materially reduce the value of Host Inc.’s common stock. The additional tax liability of Host Inc. or the subsidiary REIT for the year, or years, in which the relevant entity did not qualify as a REIT would
reduce its net earnings available for investment, debt service or distributions to stockholders. Furthermore, the non-qualifying entity would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders as a condition to REIT qualification and all of
its distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary C corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that, if Host Inc. were to fail to qualify as a REIT, Host Inc.’s stockholders
currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on those dividends at capital gain rates and Host Inc.’s corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject in each case
to applicable limitations under the Code. Host Inc.’s failure to qualify as a REIT also would cause an event of default under Host L.P.’s credit facility, which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder, which, in
turn, would constitute an event of default under Host L.P.’s outstanding debt securities.

If our leases are not respected as true
leases for federal income tax purposes, each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REITs would fail to qualify as a REIT.

To qualify as a REIT, Host Inc. must satisfy two gross income tests, pursuant to which specified percentages of its gross income must be
passive income, such as rent. For the rent paid pursuant to the hotel leases with our TRS, which rental income currently constitutes substantially all of Host Inc.’s and each of our subsidiary REITs’ gross income, to qualify for purposes
of the gross income tests, our leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement. We believe that the leases will be respected as
true leases for federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will agree with this characterization. If the leases were not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes, neither Host Inc. nor either of our
subsidiary REITs would be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs and each would likely lose its REIT status.



If our affiliated lessees fail to qualify as taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of Host Inc. and its
subsidiary REITs would fail to qualify as a REIT.

Rent paid by a lessee that is a “related party tenant” of
Host Inc. will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs. We lease substantially all of our hotels to our subsidiary that is taxable as a regular C corporation and that has elected to be treated as a
taxable REIT subsidiary with respect to Host Inc. So long as any affiliated lessee qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary, it will not be treated as a “related party tenant.” We believe that our affiliated lessees have qualified and will
continue to qualify, and that the taxable REIT subsidiaries of each of our subsidiary REITs have qualified and will continue to qualify, to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however,
that the IRS will not challenge the status of a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in disqualifying any of our affiliated lessees (including the
taxable REIT subsidiaries of our subsidiary REITs) from treatment as a taxable REIT subsidiary, it is possible that Host Inc. or a subsidiary REIT would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to REITs and substantially all of its income would fail
to qualify for the gross income tests. If Host Inc. or a subsidiary REIT failed to meet either the asset tests or the gross income tests, each would likely lose its REIT status.

Despite the REIT status of each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REITs, we remain subject to various taxes.

One of Host Inc.’s subsidiary REITs will be required to pay federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate on “built-in gain” recognized as a result of the sale of one or more of
its hotel assets prior to the expiration of the applicable 10-year holding period, including certain hotels acquired from Starwood and its affiliates in 2006. The total amount of gain on which the subsidiary REIT would be subject to corporate income
tax if all of its built-in gain assets were sold in a taxable transaction prior to the expiration of the applicable 10-year holding period would be material to it. In addition, we expect that we could recognize other substantial deferred tax
liabilities in the future without any corresponding receipt of cash.

Notwithstanding Host Inc.’s status as a REIT, Host
Inc. and our subsidiaries (including our subsidiary REITs) will be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on their income and property. For example, Host Inc. and our subsidiary REITs will pay tax on certain types of income that are
not distributed and will be subject to a 100% excise tax on transactions with a taxable REIT subsidiary that are not conducted on an arm’s length basis. Moreover, the taxable REIT subsidiaries of Host Inc. and our subsidiary REITs are taxable
as regular C corporations and will pay federal, state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable corporate rates, and foreign taxes to the extent that they own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions.

Host L.P. is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes (and any related interest and penalties) incurred by Host
Inc.

If the IRS were to challenge successfully Host L.P.’s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, Host Inc.
would cease to qualify as a REIT and would suffer other adverse consequences.

We believe that Host L.P. qualifies to
be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, it is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including Host Inc., is required to pay tax on such partner’s allocable share
of its income. No assurance can be provided, however, that the IRS will not challenge Host L.P.’s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in
treating Host L.P. as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, Host Inc. would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, cease to qualify as a REIT. If Host L.P. fails to qualify
as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or Host Inc. fails to qualify as a REIT, either failure would cause an event of default under Host L.P.’s credit facility that, in turn, could constitute an event of default under Host
L.P.’s outstanding debt securities. Also, the failure of Host L.P. to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes would cause it to become subject to federal, state and foreign corporate income tax, which tax would reduce
significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including Host Inc.



As a REIT, each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REITs is subject to limitations on its ownership of
debt and equity securities.

Subject to certain exceptions, a REIT is generally prohibited from owning securities in
any one issuer to the extent that (1) the value of those securities exceeds 5% of the value of the REIT’s total assets, (2) the securities owned by the REIT represent more than 10% of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities,
or (3) the REIT owns more than 10% of the value of the issuer’s outstanding securities. A REIT is permitted to own securities of a subsidiary in an amount that exceeds the 5% value test and the 10% vote or value test if the subsidiary
elects to be a taxable REIT subsidiary. However, a REIT may not own securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 25% of the value of the REIT’s total assets. If Host Inc. or any of its subsidiary REITs were
to violate these ownership limitations, each would likely lose its REIT status.

Each of Host Inc. or its subsidiary REITs may be
required to pay a penalty tax upon the sale of a hotel.

The federal income tax provisions applicable to REITs provide
that any gain realized by a REIT on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a “prohibited transaction” that is subject to a
100% excise tax. Under existing law, whether property, including hotels, is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with
respect to the particular transaction. We intend to hold our hotels for investment with a view to long-term appreciation, to engage in the business of acquiring and owning hotels and to make occasional sales of hotels consistent with our investment
objectives. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS might not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the 100% excise tax.

Risks Relating to Redemption of OP Units

A holder who redeems OP units may have
adverse tax consequences.

A holder who redeems OP units will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as
having sold the OP units. The sale of these units is a taxable event and the holder thereof will be treated as realizing an amount equal to the sum of the value of the common stock or cash the holder receives, plus the amount of Host L.P.’s
nonrecourse liabilities allocable to the redeemed OP units. The gain or loss recognized by the holder of OP units is measured by the difference between the amount realized by the holder and the holder’s basis in the OP units redeemed (which
will include the amount of Host L.P.’s nonrecourse liabilities allocable to the redeemed OP units). It is possible that the amount of gain the holder recognizes could exceed the value of the common stock or cash that the holder receives. It
also is possible that the tax liability resulting from this gain could exceed the value of the common stock or cash the holder receives.

If a holder of OP units elects to redeem their units, the original receipt of the OP units may be subject to tax.

If a holder of OP units elects to redeem their units, particularly within two years of receiving them, there is a risk that the original
receipt of the OP units may be treated as a taxable sale under the “disguised sale” rules of the Internal Revenue Code. Subject to several exceptions, the tax law generally provides that a partner’s contribution of property to a
partnership and a simultaneous or subsequent transfer of money or other consideration from the partnership to the partner will be presumed to be a taxable sale. In particular, if money or other consideration is transferred by a partnership to a
partner within two years of the partner’s contribution of property, the transactions are presumed to be a taxable sale of the contributed property, unless the facts and circumstances clearly establish that the transfers are not a sale. On the
other hand, if two years have passed between the original contribution of property and the transfer of money or other consideration, the transactions will not be presumed to be a taxable sale, unless the facts and circumstances clearly establish
that they should be.



Differences between an investment in shares of Host Inc. common stock and OP units may affect redeemed
holders of OP units.

If a holder of OP units elects to have OP units redeemed, we will determine whether the holder
receives cash or shares of Host Inc.’s common stock in exchange for the OP units. Although an investment in shares of Host Inc.’s common stock is substantially similar to an investment in OP units, there are some differences between
ownership of OP units and ownership of Host Inc. common stock. These differences include form of organization, management structure, voting rights, liquidity and federal income taxation, some of which may be material to investors.

hotel properties.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

On April 27, 2005, we initiated a lawsuit against Keystone-Texas Property Holding Corporation (“Keystone”) seeking a
declaration that a provision of the ground lease for the property under the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter was valid and claiming that Keystone had breached that lease provision. On October 18, 2006, Keystone filed an amended counterclaim and
later, a third party claim, alleging that we had tortiously interfered with Keystone’s attempted sale of the property and that we slandered Keystone’s title to the property.

On February 8, 2010, we received an adverse jury verdict in the 166th Judicial District Court of Bexar County, Texas. The jury found
that we tortiously interfered with the attempted sale by Keystone of the land under the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter and awarded Keystone $34.3 million in damages plus statutory interest. In addition, the jury found that we slandered
Keystone’s title to the property and awarded Keystone $39 million in damages plus statutory interest. Keystone will only be entitled to receive one of these damages awards. On February 12, 2010, the jury awarded Keystone $7.5 million in
exemplary damages with respect to the second claim. The trial court, however, subsequently granted our motion to disregard the jury’s exemplary damages award. Based on the range of possible outcomes, we have accrued a potential litigation loss
of approximately $47 million.

On June 3, 2010, the trial court entered its final judgment, reciting and
incorporating the jury’s verdict and awarding Keystone damages for slander of title, interest and attorneys’ fees. On August 26, 2010, we filed our notice of appeal based, in part, on what we believe to be numerous erroneous rulings
which adversely impacted the jury’s verdict. We intend to vigorously pursue these issues on appeal.

We also are involved
in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business and are vigorously defending these claims; however, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. We believe, based on currently available
information, that the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating
results for such period.

PART II

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for Host Inc.

Host Inc.’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol “HST.” The following table
sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of Host Inc.’s common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and dividends declared per share:

*

In reliance on the specific terms of guidance issued by the IRS and subject to certain elections by Host Inc.’s stockholders and the effect of a 10% cash
limitation, Host Inc. paid approximately 90% of the special dividend with Host Inc.’s common stock, or 13.4 million common shares, with the remaining 10% paid in cash of approximately $15.6 million.

Under the terms of our senior notes indenture and the credit facility, Host Inc.’s ability to pay dividends and make other payments
is dependent on its ability to satisfy certain financial requirements. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition” and “Risk Factors—Financial Risks
and Risks of Operation—Our ability to pay dividends and to make distributions may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness or preferred units.”

As of February 18, 2011, there were 29,391 holders of record of Host Inc.’s common stock. However, because many of the shares of its common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on
behalf of stockholders, we believe that there are considerably more beneficial holders of its common stock than record holders. As of February 18, 2011, there were 1,886 holders of OP units (in addition to Host Inc.). OP units are redeemable
for cash, or, at our election, convertible into Host Inc.’s common stock.

Host Inc.’s ability to qualify as a REIT
under the Internal Revenue Code is facilitated by limiting the number of shares of its stock that a person may own. Its charter provides that, subject to limited exceptions, no person or persons acting as a group may own, or be deemed to own by
virtue of the attribution provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, more than 9.8% in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive, of shares of Host Inc.’s outstanding common stock, preferred stock or any other stock, each considered as a
separate class or series for this purpose. Host Inc.’s Board of Directors has the authority to increase the ownership limit from time to time, but does not have the authority to do so to the extent that, after giving effect to such increase,
any five beneficial owners of capital stock could beneficially own in the aggregate more than 49.5% of the outstanding capital stock. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Ownership of Host Inc.’s Common Stock—There are limitations
on the acquisition of Host Inc. common stock and changes in control.”

Market for Registrant’s Common Units, Related Unitholder Matters and
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for Host L.P.

There is no established public trading market for our OP units and
transfers of OP units are restricted by the terms of Host L.P.’s partnership agreement. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture and our credit facility, Host L.P.’s ability to make distributions and other payments is dependent on its
ability to satisfy certain financial requirements. See “Risk Factors—Our ability to pay dividends and to make distributions may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness or preferred units.” The following table sets
forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, Host L.P.’s distributions declared per common OP unit:

*

On September 14, 2009, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized a special dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on
December 18, 2009 to holders of record as of November 6, 2009. In reliance on the specific terms of guidance issued by the IRS and subject to certain elections by Host Inc.’s stockholders and the effect of a 10% cash limitation, Host
Inc. paid approximately 90% of the special dividend with Host Inc.’s common stock, or 13.4 million common shares, with the remaining 10% paid in cash of approximately $15.6 million. Pursuant to the partnership agreement of Host L.P.,
common OP unitholders received the cash distribution of 10% of the $0.25 per share dividend paid by Host Inc. to its common stockholders, or $0.025 per OP unit, but did not receive an equivalent per unit distribution for the 90% of the dividend paid
with Host Inc.’s common stock. Instead, the conversion factor used to convert OP units into shares of Host Inc.’s common stock was proportionately adjusted from 1.0 to 1.021494. This adjustment to the conversion factor was made to avoid
any unintended dilution as a result of the portion of Host Inc.’s dividend paid with shares of its common stock to its stockholders.

The number of holders of record of Host L.P.’s common OP units on February 18, 2011 was 1,886. The number of outstanding common OP units as of February 18, 2011 was 676,522,234, of which
666,110,729 were owned by Host Inc. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture and the credit facility, Host L.P.’s ability to make distributions and other payments is dependent on its ability to satisfy certain financial requirements. In
addition, under the terms of Host L.P.’s preferred OP units, we are not permitted to make distributions on our common OP units unless all cumulative distributions have been paid on our preferred OP units. See “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition” and “Risk Factors—Financial Risks and Risks of Operation—Our ability to pay dividends and to make distributions may be limited or prohibited
by the terms of our indebtedness or preferred units.”

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.

Overview

Host Inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT. Host Inc. is the sole general partner of Host L.P. and holds 98.4% of its
partnership interests. Host L.P. is a limited partnership operating through an umbrella partnership structure. As of February 18, 2011, we own 120 hotels, primarily consisting of luxury and upper upscale properties. Host Inc. is the largest
lodging REIT in NAREIT’s composite index. A REIT is a legal entity that owns real estate assets and, through payments of dividends to stockholders, is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level.

Our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. The majority
of our properties are luxury and upper upscale that are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors. In 2010, approximately
79% of our revenues were generated by our urban and resort/conference hotels. While our hotels are still subject to competitive pressures, we believe this strategy should allow us to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums in excess of those of our
competitors. We seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management by assisting the managers of our hotels in optimizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements.

Our Customers

The
majority of our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business. The table below details the percentage of our room sales for each group:

Similar to the majority of
the lodging industry, we further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows:

Transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers. Business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. Therefore, we will be more significantly affected
by trends in business travel versus leisure demand. The four key subcategories of the transient business group are:

•

Premium: Sometimes referred to as “rack rate,” this rate is typically applied to rooms booked close to arrival during high demand periods and
is the highest rate category available. Room rates will fluctuate depending on anticipated demand levels (e.g. seasonality and weekday vs. weekend stays).

•

Corporate: This is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public. It is typically the second highest category and is for
travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discount rates.

•

Special Corporate: This is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel
or to hotel brands generally. These rates are typically negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated corporate rate.

•

Discount: This encompasses all discount programs, such as AAA and AARP discounts, government per diem, rooms booked through wholesale channels,
frequent guest program redemptions, and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel.



Group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together, usually with a minimum of
10 rooms. Examples include a company training session or a social event such as a family reunion. The three key sub-categories of the group business category are:

•

Association: group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions.

•

Corporate: group business related to corporate meetings (e.g., product launches, training programs, contract negotiations, and presentations).

•

Other: group business predominately related to social, military, education, religious, fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams, otherwise known as
SMERF business.

The final category is contract demand, which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific
company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates. Contract rates are usually utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand. Airline crews are typical generators of
contract demand for our hotels.

Understanding Our Performance

Our Revenues and Expenses.

Our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the
levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. We generally
receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each four-week or monthly accounting period, which distribution reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation).

Revenues for owned hotels are 96% of our total revenue. The following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage
of our total revenue:



Hotel operating expenses are approximately 97% of our total operating costs and expenses.
The following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses:

The expense components
listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. It also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. Taken separately, these costs represent approximately 50% to 55% of our
hotel operating expenses.

Key Performance Indicators.

Revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) is a
commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include food and beverage or parking,
telephone or other guest service revenues generated by the property. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels.

RevPAR changes that are driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental
operating profit, than do changes that are driven predominately by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage, as well as additional
incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, would not result in additional room-related costs. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by increases or
decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels.

In
discussing our operating results, we present RevPAR and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis. Comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting



periods being compared. Comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold, or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage, large scale capital
improvements or significant events during these periods.

We also evaluate the performance of our business through certain
non-GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. We provide a more
detailed discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in “—Non-GAAP Financial
Measures.” Our non-GAAP financial measures include:

•

Host Inc.’s funds from operations (“FFO”) and FFO per diluted share.

We use FFO and FFO per diluted share as a supplemental
measure of company-wide profitability.

•

Host Inc’s and Host L.P.’s hotel adjusted operating profit

. Hotel adjusted operating profit measures property-level results before
debt service and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property-level profitability. We also use hotel adjusted operating profit to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels.

•

Host Inc.’s and Host L.P.’s EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.

Earnings before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization
(“EBITDA”), is a commonly used measure in many industries, and management believes that such measure provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations as it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing
operating performance of our properties and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. We adjust EBITDA when evaluating our performance because we believe that
the exclusion of certain items, such as gains and losses related to real estate transactions and impairment losses (“Adjusted EBITDA”), provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance.

Summary of 2010 Operating Results

During 2010, the lodging recovery exceeded industry expectations as overall RevPAR grew 5.5% compared to 2009. Similarly, RevPAR at our comparable hotels increased 5.8% compared to 2009. As is expected
during a recovery, the initial improvements in RevPAR were driven by improvements in occupancy, which improved by 3.8 percentage points in 2010. Overall, average room rates were essentially flat, with an improvement of 0.1% during the year; however,
as the year progressed, lodging demand improved and our managers were able to increase rates, somewhat shifting pricing power away from the consumer. As a result, comparable hotel rates for the third and fourth quarter of 2010 improved 4.5% and
2.8%, respectively. Early in the year, the recovery was driven by increased demand from corporate transient business, which was eventually joined by improvements across the majority of our customer types. This RevPAR improvement includes a 7.6%
improvement in comparable hotel transient RevPAR and a 3.5% improvement in comparable hotel group RevPAR. Typically, the recovery of group revenue will lag that of transient revenue as price increases and business mix changes can more quickly
increase transient average rates, and because group contracts that were negotiated near the bottom of the lodging cycle reflect lower rates and, therefore, will slow recovery for group revenues in the near term. As a result of these trends, total
comparable revenues for our owned hotels increased $167 million, or 4.2%, to approximately $4.1 billion for the year. In addition to the hotel revenues for our owned hotels described above, our other revenues increased $92 million due to
the inclusion of hotel revenues from a portfolio of 71 Courtyard by Marriott and Residence Inn by Marriott hotels leased from Hospitality Properties Trust that had been previously sublet (the “HPT portfolio”; see “Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements and Contractual Obligations”). Therefore, overall revenue increased $293 million, or 7.1%, to approximately $4.4 billion for 2010.

As described above, the improvements in RevPAR were primarily driven by occupancy gains, which have less of a positive effect on overall profitability compared to increases driven by average room rate. As
a result, the improvement in overall profitability was partially offset by increases in incremental costs at the hotels as well as the decline in the cancellation and attrition revenues. Additionally, our total expenses include rental and hotel
level



expenses for the leased HPT portfolio, described above, of $180 million, which decreased our overall operating profit by $13 million. Other significant items that affected the comparability of
our results between 2010 and 2009 include:

2010:

•

The recognition of $10 million of acquisition costs related to our successful hotel acquisitions, which costs are now required to be recorded in
corporate expenses when incurred. Prior to the change in accounting treatment effective January 1, 2009, these costs would have been capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset; and,

•

an increase in interest expense during 2010 due to costs associated with debt extinguishments (including the acceleration of deferred financing costs
and original issue discounts) totaling $21 million, compared to a net gain of $9 million on debt extinguishments in 2009.

2009:

•

Impairment charges related to real estate and investments totaling $131 million. Of these impairment charges, $20 million was included in depreciation
expense, $77 million was included in discontinued operations and $34 million was included in equity in affiliates. No impairment charges were recorded in 2010;

•

gains on dispositions totaling $31 million compared to a loss on dispositions of $2 million in 2010; and,

•

charges related to a potential litigation loss of $41 million.

As a result of the improved operations, and the items described above, GAAP operating profit increased 50% to $223 million in 2010. Our
comparable hotel adjusted operating profit, which reflects the hotel-level revenues and expenses for our comparable hotels and does not include the items described above or the results of the HPT portfolio, increased $44 million, or 5%, to $882
million. Net loss for Host Inc. decreased $126 million in 2010 to a loss of $132 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased $26 million, or 3.3%, to $824 million.

Host Inc.’s diluted loss per common share decreased $.24 to a loss in 2010 of $.21. The reduction in our loss per diluted share reflects the improvement in operating results at our hotels as
described above. Host Inc.’s FFO per diluted share increased 33% to $.68 for 2010. For 2010 and 2009, the transactions described above reduced net loss per diluted share by $.06 and $.23, respectively, and reduced FFO per diluted share by $.06
and $.28, respectively.

The trends and transactions described above for Host Inc. similarly affected the operating results
for Host L.P, as the only significant difference between the Host Inc. and Host L.P. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the outside partners of Host L.P. For the year, Host L.P.’s net loss declined
$126 million to $132 million, and the loss per diluted unit declined $.24 to $.21 per unit.

Financing Activities

During 2010, we continued to progress in our overall goal to strengthen our balance sheet by lowering our debt-to-equity ratio; however,
we shifted our focus from increasing our liquidity (which was our main focus in the uncertain recessionary period of 2009) to strategically raising and deploying capital to improve our overall leverage ratios, while at the same time completing
substantial investments in our portfolio through acquisitions and capital investments. As a result of these efforts:

•

During the year, we issued $500 million of 6% Series U senior notes and repaid approximately $1.1 billion of senior notes and mortgage debt. We also
assumed $166 million of mortgage debt, of which $115 million was repaid in the fourth quarter, and drew $56 million under our credit facility in connection with our 2010 acquisitions. Overall, our debt balance was reduced by $360 million from
December 31, 2009;



•

We issued 26.9 million common shares under our “at the market” offering programs. The shares were issued at an average price of $15.25
per share for net proceeds of $406 million. Proceeds from these issuances were used to fund acquisitions and capital investments;

•

As of December 31, 2010, 102 of our 113 properties are unencumbered by mortgage debt;

•

We improved our overall leverage and coverage ratios, as defined in our senior note and credit facility covenants. Specifically, our leverage ratio
(total debt/EBITDA, as defined) decreased 30 basis points to 5.0x and our interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/interest, as defined) increased 30 basis points to 3.0x; and

•

At year end, we held over $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and had $542 million of availability under our credit facility. We expect to
deploy over $900 million of cash to execute our recently announced acquisitions discussed below.

We
believe, based on the overall strength of our balance sheet, that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to pay our near-term debt maturities, fund our capital expenditures programs and take advantage of investment
opportunities (for a detailed discussion, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources”).

Investing Activities

Acquisitions.

2010 marked a significant increase in transaction activity for luxury and upper upscale lodging properties
from the extremely depressed levels in 2009. We believe that the lodging industry is in the early stages of a recovery, which presents an opportunity to purchase assets with high growth potential at a significant discount to replacement cost. Many
of the acquisition opportunities are associated with the significant number of hotel properties that are encumbered with very high levels of debt that are facing maturity deadlines and have few, if any, refinancing options. In many cases, we expect
that these owners will seek to meet the financing obligations through an all cash sale of the hotel. In addition, lenders are foreclosing on hotels with the objective of a subsequent sale. An example of this type of transaction is our recent
acquisition of the W New York, Union Square. During 2010, we completed the following acquisitions:

•

the 245-room JW Marriott, Rio de Janeiro for approximately R$80 million ($47 million);

•

the 270-room W New York, Union Square for approximately $188 million, through a joint venture in which we are the 90% controlling partner. Our
investment was approximately $169 million;

•

the 424-room Westin Chicago River North for approximately $165 million; and

•

the leasehold interest in the 266-room Le Méridien Piccadilly for approximately £64 million ($98 million).

Subsequent to year end, we completed the acquisition of a portfolio of seven hotels in New Zealand and
entered into agreements to purchase hotels in New York and San Diego as follows:

•

In January 2011, we entered into an agreement to acquire the 775-room New York Helmsley Hotel for $313.5 million. The property will be managed by
Starwood, initially as an unbranded hotel. As part of a comprehensive renovation costing approximately $65 million, the guestrooms and guest baths will be completely renovated, a few rooms will be added to the inventory and the meeting space will be
upgraded. When the renovations are complete in early to mid-2012, the property will be branded as a Westin. While the hotel will benefit from Starwood’s management and reservation system as an unbranded hotel, operations of the hotel will be
negatively affected during the renovation process. This acquisition is expected to close in March 2011, subject to customary closing conditions.

•

In February 2011, we also entered into an agreement to acquire the entity that owns the 1,625-room Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego, and certain
related rights, for $570 million. The hotel is located along the waterfront, adjacent to the city’s central business district and convention center and has over 125,000



square feet of meeting space, six food and beverage outlets, and a 10,000 square foot spa. The transaction will be comprised of cash consideration of $564 million, including the repayment of
$408 million of existing loans. We will also issue approximately $6 million of common OP Units and $98 million of preferred OP units. We will also record a note receivable equal in value to the preferred OP units. The interest rate on
the note receivable will be 0.25 percentage points less than the dividend rate on the preferred OP units. In accordance with ASC 505, a right of setoff exists between the note receivable and the preferred OP units, as the proceeds from the
redemption of the preferred OP Units must be used to repay the note receivable. Therefore, neither will be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. The transaction is expected to close in March of 2011, and is subject to various closing
conditions, including approval by the San Diego Unified Port District.

•

On February 18, 2011, we completed the acquisition of a portfolio of seven midscale and upscale hotels in New Zealand for approximately $145
million, including $80 million of mortgage debt. The properties are located in the cities of Auckland, Queenstown, Christchurch and Wellington and will be operated by Accor under the ibis and Novotel brands. Accor is a leading international
hotel operator with over 4,200 hotels and 500,000 rooms in 90 countries worldwide.

Repositioning and
Return on Investment Capital Expenditures

.

During 2010 and 2009, we completed a total of $114 million and $176 million, respectively, in ROI/repositioning expenditures at numerous properties. For 2010, repositioning and ROI
expenditures included the following projects:

•

San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina—an extensive multi-year $190 million project to reposition and renovate the hotel which will include
all 1,360 guest rooms, the pool and fitness center, as well as the expansion and development of new meeting space and an exhibit hall;

•

Westin Kierland Resort & Spa—the development of a new 21,500 square foot ballroom and 4,500 square foot outdoor venue space; and,

•

Miami Marriott Biscayne Bay—Completed extensive lobby renovations and the development of a three-meal restaurant, as well as the conversion of
3,900 square feet to meeting space.

We expect that our investment in ROI and repositioning expenditures in
2011 will total approximately $290 million to $310 million, including $190 million of projects at the following properties:

•

Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers—the complete renovation of all 1,756 rooms, as well as major mechanical upgrades to the heating and
cooling system;

•

Atlanta Marriott Perimeter Center—complete repositioning of the hotel including rooms renovation, lobby enhancements, mechanical systems upgrades,
parking garage and exterior enhancements;

•

Chicago Marriott O’Hare—complete repositioning of the hotel including rooms renovation, new meeting space and the creation of a new great
room and lobby;

•

San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina—continuation of the extensive renovation and repositioning project begun in 2010; and,

•

Sheraton Indianapolis—renovation of rooms, lobby, fitness center, bar and restaurant, as well as the conversion of an existing tower into 129
managed apartments.

Renewal and Replacement Capital Expenditures.

In addition to the
repositioning/ROI expenditures described above, we spent $195 million and $164 million on renewal and replacement expenditures during 2010 and 2009, respectively. These expenditures are designed to ensure that our high standards for product quality
are maintained and to enhance the overall competitiveness of our properties in the marketplace. Major renewal and replacement projects that were underway during the fourth quarter of 2010 included: 450 rooms at the Fairmont Kea



Lani, 98,700 square feet of meeting space at the Sheraton Boston, 87,500 square feet of meeting space at the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown, 1001 rooms at the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter and
36,000 square feet of meeting space at the Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill.

Dispositions.

The market
for selling hotels located in secondary and tertiary markets, which are our primary disposition targets, remains challenging. We disposed of two non-core properties in 2010 for a total of approximately $12 million where we believed that the
potential for future returns were lower than our target levels.

2011 Outlook

Forecasts for real GDP growth in 2011 improved significantly in the fourth quarter of 2010, as the pace of consumer spending increased and
the tax legislation package was passed in late December. Economists also anticipate substantial growth in business investment for 2011, which is a key driver for our industry, and for transient demand in particular. However, full year operating
forecasts remain uncertain, particularly as employment levels and the housing market remain weak points in the overall economic outlook. As detailed in our 2010 operating results, 2010’s RevPAR improvement was primarily driven by improvements
in occupancy, as rate increases were not broadly recognized across the portfolio until the second half of the year. For 2011, as the recovery moves into its next phase, we anticipate that the improvements in RevPAR will be driven by both rate and
occupancy growth, which will have a more significant positive effect on our operating results.

At the same time, we also
anticipate that supply growth in the lodging industry will remain at historically low levels in 2011 as the disruption in the credit markets and weak lodging performance caused a significant decline in new hotel construction starts beginning in the
second half of 2008 through 2010. This may be particularly relevant for the markets and lodging sectors in which we compete due to the long-term planning and high level of investment associated with luxury and upper upscale lodging properties in
urban and resort destinations. We believe that lower supply growth will have a positive effect in 2011, as the improvements in lodging demand will not lead to a corresponding increase in supply. Based on the lack of new construction starts in recent
years, we believe that supply growth should remain below the historical trend for the lodging industry for the next few years.

Based on the trends discussed above and the forecast ROI/repositioning projects, as well as other capital expenditures at our properties,
we anticipate that comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 6% to 8% during 2011. We believe that the positive trends in the lodging industry create the opportunity for business improvements, which when combined with our strategy to enhance our
portfolio through acquisitions and capital projects will ultimately improve the competitive position of our properties and stockholder value. However, there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will
continue for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns. See also “Risk Factors.”

Hotel Sales Overview

2010 Compared to 2009.

In 2010, hotel sales grew 5.0% for our consolidated revenues
for owned hotels, reflecting strong growth in RevPAR at our properties, as well as increases in rooms and food and beverage revenues, partially offset by a decline in attrition and cancellation fees. Revenues for properties sold in 2010 or 2009 have
been reclassified to discontinued operations. See “—Discontinued Operations” below.

Rooms.

The increase
in room revenue in 2010 is consistent with the overall increase in RevPAR, primarily due to occupancy gains at our hotels. While the majority of the increase is due to the 5.8% increase in RevPAR at our comparable hotels, there was also a 1.7%
increase related to the revenues recorded at the hotels acquired during the year.

Food and beverage

. The increase in
food and beverage revenue in 2010 is primarily attributable to increased occupancy, which contributes to greater demand for catering and banquet business.

Other.

The decrease in other revenues for owned hotels in 2010 is primarily a result of a decline in attrition and cancellation fees of approximately $37 million.

Other revenues.

For 2010, the increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of the HPT hotel revenue. On July 6, 2010, we
terminated the subleases for 71 hotels leased from HPT because the subtenants failed to meet net worth covenants. Accordingly, beginning on July 7, 2010, we record the operations of the hotels instead of rental income, which we have recorded in
other revenues. For 2010, revenues for hotels leased from HPT include hotel revenues of $123 million and rental income of $44 million. For 2009, revenues for hotels leased from HPT include rental income of $79 million. The property
revenues and rental income recorded, less the hotel expenses and rental expenses for the HPT properties, resulted in net losses of $13 million and $1 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Effective December 2010, we terminated the
leases with respect to 18 of these properties. We also have given notice that we plan to terminate the leases with respect to the remaining 53 properties in December 2012. See “— Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual
Obligations.”

While management evaluates the performance of each individual hotel against its competitive set in a given
market, overall we evaluate the portfolio operating results using three different criteria: property type (i.e. urban, suburban, resort/conference or airport), geographic region and mix of business (i.e. transient, group or contract).



Comparable Hotel Sales by Property Type.

The following tables set forth
performance information for 2010 and 2009:

Comparable Hotels Portfolio by Property Type (a)

(a)

The reporting period for 2010 is from January 2, 2010 to December 31, 2010 and for 2009 is from January 3, 2009 to January 1, 2010 for our Marriott
hotels. For further discussion, see “—Reporting Periods.”

During 2010, comparable hotel RevPAR
increased across all of our hotel property types. Our urban properties led the portfolio, with a 6.8% increase in RevPAR for the year. The continued improvement in demand has allowed our operators to begin to increase the average room rates at our
urban properties, which improved 1.6% overall for the year. Our suburban properties also experienced a significant RevPAR increase in 2010 driven by strength in the suburban Boston, Orange County and San Francisco markets. Our resort/conference
hotels lagged the portfolio as a whole, as the 7.9% improvement in RevPAR at our resort/conference properties in our Florida region were partially offset by the RevPAR declines in the Phoenix and Palm Springs markets. RevPAR at our Airport
properties improved 5.2% for the year driven by strong demand growth in the Chicago and San Francisco airport markets.

Comparable Hotel Sales by Geographic Region

. The following tables set forth performance information for 2010 and 2009:

Comparable Hotels by Region (a)

(a)

The reporting period for 2010 is from January 2, 2010 to December 31, 2010 and for 2009 is from January 3, 2009 to January 1, 2010 for our Marriott
hotels. For further discussion, see “—Reporting Periods.”

For 2010, comparable hotel RevPAR
improved across all of our geographic regions when compared to 2009. Our New England region was the top performing U.S. region, with RevPAR growth of 10.8% that was driven by RevPAR growth of 11.6% in the Boston market. This increase was due to
strong group and transient demand, as occupancy increased 5.0 percentage points and average room rates increased 3.9%.



The 9.4% RevPAR growth in our Atlanta region was driven primarily by strong city-wide and
transient business in the fourth quarter. Strong demand from both group and transient customers drove a 9.0 percentage point occupancy increase in the fourth quarter.

RevPAR in our Mid-Atlantic region grew 7.7% for the year, driven by RevPAR growth at our New York properties of 9.5%. For our New York properties, rate improved 5.7% and occupancy improved by 3.0
percentage points.

Our Florida region had an increase in RevPAR of 6.4% for the year, led by strong performance at our
resort/conference hotels in this region. RevPAR at our Florida resort/conference hotels increased 7.9% for the year, driven primarily by an increase in occupancy of 6.6 percentage points; however, this increase was affected by lower group demand as
well as significant renovations at the Orlando World Center Marriott Resort and Convention Center in the fourth quarter.

The
RevPAR increase for the year in our North Central region was driven by our Chicago hotels, as RevPAR increased 8.8% due to strong transient demand and rate increased 2.6%.

Results in our Mountain region were mixed, as the Denver market experienced a 7.9% increase in RevPAR primarily due to strong group and transient demand, while the Phoenix market experienced a 3.9%
decline in RevPAR, which was partially attributable to the renovation of a significant amount of meeting space at two hotels and the construction of a new ballroom at the Westin Kierland.

Our DC Metro region underperformed the portfolio in terms of RevPAR growth which reflects difficult comparisons to the prior year,
particularly during the first quarter, due to the 2009 presidential inauguration and other government-related activities.

Hotel Sales by Business Mix

. The majority of our customers fall into three broad groups: transient, group and contract
business. The information below is derived from business mix data for 108 of our hotels for which information is available from our managers.

In 2010, overall transient RevPAR increased 7.6% when compared to 2009, reflecting an increase in total room nights of 4.9%, and an increase in average rates of 2.6%. The rate increase was driven
primarily by a 5.0% increase in average rate for corporate transient business and a shift in mix away from discounted business.

During 2010, group RevPAR increased approximately 3.5%, reflecting an increase in total room nights of 6.7%, partially offset by a
decrease in average rates of 3.0%. Typically, recovery in the group segment will follow improvement in transient demand due to longer booking lead times. As a result, a large portion of the 2010 group business was sold at the lower rates in effect
in prior periods. Therefore, while we did experience improvements in group demand, improvements in overall group revenue continues to lag that of transient revenue.

2009 Compared to 2008

.

The decrease in hotel sales and food and beverage revenues was primarily attributable to decreased occupancy, which drives lower room rates and less demand for
catering and banquet business, as well as other ancillary revenues such as spas, golf, parking, internet connectivity and other fees. Sales for properties disposed of in both years have been reclassified as discontinued operations. See
“—Discontinued Operations” below.

Consistent with the portfolio as a whole, comparable hotel RevPAR decreased
19.9%, with a 5.4 percentage point decrease in occupancy and a 13.5% decrease in average room rates. Another factor that contributed to the decrease in revenues was corporate travelers downgrading from luxury properties to other hotel segments due
to political and public relations concerns regarding corporate expenditures on luxury services. This had a significant effect on our Ritz-Carlton properties as well as our resort locations.



Comparable Hotel Sales by Property Type

. The following tables set forth
performance information for 2009 and 2008:

Comparable Hotels Portfolio by Property Type (a)

(a)

The reporting period for 2009 is from January 3, 2009 to January 1, 2010 and for 2008 is from December 29, 2007 to December 26, 2008 for our
Marriott hotels. For further discussion, see “—Reporting Periods.”

Consistent with 2008, our
2009 urban properties continued to outperform the portfolio as a whole. We believe the location of these assets provided a diversified demand base that helped drive higher levels of occupancy, which partially mitigated the decline in average room
rate compared to other property types. As noted above, our resort/conference properties were particularly affected by traveler concerns regarding corporate expenditures for luxury hotels and services.

Comparable Hotel Sales by Geographic Region

. The following tables set forth performance information for 2009 and 2008:

Comparable Hotels by Region (a)

The reporting period for 2009 is from January 3, 2009 to January 1, 2010 and for 2008 is from December 29, 2007 to December 26, 2008 for our
Marriott hotels. For further discussion, see “—Reporting Periods.”

Other than the DC Metro
region, all of our regions had substantial declines in RevPAR, though results reflect the different dynamics of the major markets within each region. RevPAR at hotels in our top performing DC Metro region declined 5.8%, though individual properties
within the region varied from an increase of 7.4% to a decline of 25.4% in RevPAR, with the strongest performers being our downtown properties that benefited from government and government-related activity. Similarly, the 15.8% RevPAR decline in the
South Central region included a RevPAR decrease of 3.7% in New Orleans and a decline of 21.4% in Houston.



Hotel Sales by Business Mix

. The majority of our customers fall into three broad
groups: transient, group and contract business. The information below is derived from business mix data for 111 of our hotels for which information is available from our managers.

In 2009, transient RevPAR decreased 18.6% when compared to 2008, reflecting a slight decline in total room nights and a decline in
average rate of 17.7%. The decline primarily reflects a shift from the higher-rated premium and corporate business to the price-sensitive transient discount business. Room nights for premium and corporate business declined 17.3%, despite a decline
in average rates of 18.9%, which led to a RevPAR decline of 32.9% in this business. This was slightly offset by the 8.6% growth in room nights from price-sensitive transient discount business as customers, particularly leisure travelers, utilized
discount programs implemented by our managers, as well as, third-party travel websites offering discounted rates.

Group
RevPAR declined approximately 23.2% reflecting a decline in total room nights of 17.2% and a decline in average room rates of 7.2%. The decline in room rate was primarily due to corporate group discounts and short-term group rate concessions. The
primary driver of the decline in room nights was a significant reduction in corporate group business of 32.8%. In addition to significant reductions in corporate group meetings, this also reflects low attendance at group meetings and groups
increasingly renegotiating rates.

Property-level Operating Expenses

2010 compared to 2009 and 2009 compared to 2008.

The overall increase in operating
expenses in 2010 is consistent with higher overall RevPAR at our properties and improvement in occupancy at our hotels. The overall decrease in operating expenses in 2009 is consistent with lower overall demand at our properties and our hotel
managers actively implementing contingency plans and cost saving measures in order to manage operating margin decline. Our operating costs and expenses, which are both fixed and variable, are affected by changes in occupancy, inflationary increases
and revenues (which affect management fees), though the effect on specific costs will differ. Property-level operating expenses exclude the costs associated with hotels we have sold during the periods presented, which costs are included in
discontinued operations.

Rooms.

The increase in room expenses in 2010 is consistent with the overall increase in
occupancy and was also affected by higher wage rates. The decrease in room expenses in 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in occupancy. We also benefited from cost cutting measures implemented by our managers that reduced controllable expenses,
such as closing rooms in unused sections of the hotels, and reducing management staff and labor hours per occupied room.

Food and beverage

. The increase in food and beverage costs in 2010 reflects the increase in revenues, partially offset by the
positive shift in the mix of business to more catering and audio visual revenues. However, weak productivity in banquet sales hurt overall profitability. The decline in food and beverages costs in 2009 was primarily driven by a decrease in
occupancy, which led to a reduction in food and beverages cost of goods sold, and reductions in restaurant hourly and management staff.

Other departmental and support expenses.

The increase in revenues drove an increase in non-controllable hotel expenses during 2010, such as credit card commissions, bonus expense, loyalty rewards
program expenses and



cluster and shared service allocations. The decline in these expenses in 2009 reflected a reduction in controllable expenses, such as marketing and general and administration expenses that were
driven by a decrease in the wages and benefits allocated to these expenses, reflecting a decline in management staffing and bonus payouts. Additionally, in 2009, utilities declined 11.5% as a result of a decline in prices, lower occupancy levels and
milder weather.

Management fees.

Our base management fees, which are generally calculated as a percentage of total
revenues, increased 3.9% for 2010, which is consistent with the increase in revenues. The incentive management fees, which are based on the level of operating profit at each property after the owner has received a priority return on its investment,
increased 17.5% during the year, consistent with the increase in operating profit at certain properties. The decrease in 2009 is consistent with our revenue decline.

Other property-level expenses

. These expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. For 2010, the increase was primarily
driven by the inclusion of the HPT hotel expenses discussed below, partially offset by decreases in property insurance costs due to the reduction in premiums for our insurance program that runs from June 1, 2010 to May 31, 2011.

As previously discussed, beginning on July 7, 2010, we record the operations of 71 hotels leased from HPT. For 2010,
expenses for hotels leased from HPT include rental expense of $84 million due to HPT, as well as the $96 million of hotel expenses incurred subsequent to the sublease termination. For 2009, expenses for hotels leased from HPT represent
rental expense due to HPT of $80 million.

Depreciation and amortization.

The decline in depreciation expense in
2010 is due to impairment charges recorded in 2009 of approximately $20 million. Other impairment charges for 2009 are included in equity in losses of affiliates or discontinued operations. No impairment charges were recorded in 2010. The
increase in depreciation expense in 2009 reflects the effect of our extensive $1.8 billion capital expenditures program from 2006 to 2008 as well as the impairment charges described above.

Other Income Statement Line Items

Corporate and Other
Expenses.

Corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and bonuses and other costs, such as employee stock-based compensation expense, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, acquisition-related costs, audit fees,
building rent and systems costs. Corporate expenses decreased approximately $8 million in 2010 from 2009 and increased approximately $58 million in 2009 from 2008. The decrease during 2010 is primarily due to litigation costs of
$41 million accrued in 2009 for a potential litigation loss. See “Legal Proceedings.” The decrease was partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expense and bonus accruals, as well as an increase of $10 million
associated with consummated property acquisitions. Previously, the acquisition costs would have been capitalized; however, under accounting requirements adopted in 2009, these costs are now expensed. The expense for the stock-based compensation
awards is based on personal performance, as well as Host Inc.’s stockholder return relative to other REITs and to other lodging companies and will vary significantly due to fluctuations in Host Inc.’s stock price. The 2010 increase
reflects the outperformance in Host Inc.’s stockholder return relative to other REITs and other lodging companies, a 53.1% increase in Host Inc.’s stock price since 2009 and the overall improvement in operations.

The increase in corporate and other expenses in 2009 reflects the litigation costs described above, as well as an increase in stock-based
compensation expense, which returned to more normalized levels compared to 2008.

Gain on Insurance Settlement.

During 2010, we recorded a gain of $3 million related to the receipt of business interruption insurance related to our two hotels in Chile, which were affected by the earthquake in July 2010. The damage to our properties was not severe;
however, to the extent that we receive further business interruption insurance proceeds or property insurance proceeds in excess of the insurance receivable recorded for the property and equipment written off, we will record a gain. We recorded a
gain on insurance settlement of $7 million in 2008. The gain primarily related to the insurance proceeds received for both business interruption and property damage following Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma which occurred during September and
October 2005, respectively.



Interest Expense.

The increase in interest expense during 2010 is due to costs
associated with debt extinguishments (including the acceleration of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts) totaling $21 million compared to a net gain of $9 million on debt extinguishments in 2009. This increase was
partially offset by a net decrease in our overall debt balance, which resulted in interest savings of approximately $23 million. In addition, the fixed-to-floating interest rate swap that we entered into in the second half of 2009 for our
$300 million mortgage on The Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa reduced interest expense by $5 million for 2010 compared to 2009.

The increase in interest expense during 2009 from 2008 is primarily due to a decrease of $5 million in the net gain associated with the repurchase of our exchangeable senior debentures in 2009 and
2008.

Net Gains on Property Transactions.

The significant increase in gains from property transactions in 2009
when compared to both 2010 and 2008 is due to the recognition of a $13 million gain associated with the sale of our remaining 3.6% limited partnership interest in a partnership that owned 115 Courtyard by Marriott hotels.

Equity in Earnings (losses) of Affiliates.

The significant increase in losses of affiliates during 2009 when
compared to both 2010 and 2008 is a result of an impairment charge of $34 million recorded in 2009, described below, related to our investment in the European joint venture. We evaluate the recoverability of our investment in affiliates based on our
assessment of the fair value of our investment in comparison to our carrying value. In 2009, we determined that the carrying value of our investment in our joint venture in Europe exceeded its fair value on an other-than-temporary basis. As a
result, we recorded an impairment charge of $34 million, which impairment charge is included in equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates. See “—Critical Accounting Policies—Other-than-Temporary Impairment of an Investment”
for further discussion.

Income Tax Benefit.

We lease substantially all of our properties to consolidated
subsidiaries designated as TRS for federal income tax purposes. The difference between hotel-level operating cash flow and the aggregate rent paid to Host L.P. by the TRS represents taxable income or loss, on which we record an income tax provision
or benefit. The decrease in the tax benefit in 2010 reflects lower expenses at our TRS and the overall improvement in operating results at our properties. As most of the hotels in 2010 are paying the minimum rent under the lease agreements, a
significant amount of the improvement in profitability is retained by the TRS and, therefore, decreases its taxable loss. Additionally, in 2009 we recognized a $12 million tax benefit with respect to the sale of our remaining interest in the
CBM Joint Venture Limited Partnership (“CBM JV”).

Discontinued Operations.

Discontinued
operations consist of two hotels disposed of in 2010, six hotels disposed of in 2009 (including one hotel for which the ground lease expired and reverted back to the ground lessor) and two hotels disposed of during 2008 and represent the results of
operations and the gains on the disposition of these hotels during the periods. The following table summarizes the revenues, income before taxes, and the gain on dispositions, net of tax, of the hotels which have been reclassified to discontinued
operations, which includes assets held for sale and the results of sold hotels prior to their disposition for the periods presented (in millions):

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity and Capital Resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P.

The liquidity and capital resources of Host Inc.
and Host L.P. are primarily derived from the activities of Host L.P. Host L.P. generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of OP units or the sale of equity
interests of its subsidiaries. Host Inc. is a REIT whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of Host L.P.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through Host L.P., except for the issuance of its
common and preferred stock. However, proceeds from stock issuances by Host Inc. are contributed to Host L.P. in exchange for OP units. Additionally, funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by Host L.P. Therefore,
while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P., we have not included a separate discussion of the liquidity and capital resources of each entity as the discussion below can be applied to both
Host Inc. and Host L.P.



Overview.

We look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with
an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility, given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry. During the difficult recessionary period in 2009, we focused on improving our liquidity position
through equity and debt issuances, which totaled over $1.7 billion. As a result of these efforts, we entered the growth period of 2010 with over $1.5 billion of cash and $600 million available under our credit facility. As the overall economy,
credit markets and lodging industry strengthened during 2010, we shifted the focus of our financing efforts from maintaining liquidity to strategically decreasing our debt-to-equity ratio through (i) acquisitions and other investments, the
majority of which were completed with available cash and proceeds from equity issuances, and (ii) the repayment and refinancing of senior notes and mortgage debt. As a result, we have improved our overall leverage and coverage ratios, issued
$406 million of equity and completed $532 million of acquisitions and other capital investments during the year. At the same time, our liquidity position remains very strong, with over $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents (prior to
amounts used for the 2011 acquisitions discussed herein) and $542 million available capacity under our credit facility.

We also look to structure our debt profile to allow us to access different forms of financing, primarily senior notes and exchangeable
debentures, as well as mortgage debt. Generally, this means that we will look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt, minimize near-term maturities, and maintain a balanced maturity schedule. As of December 31,
2010, 102 of our 113 hotels are unencumbered by mortgage debt and approximately 79% of our debt consists of senior notes and borrowings under our credit facility, both of which are guaranteed by various subsidiaries and secured by pledges in
subsidiaries, but are not collateralized by specific hotel properties. Additionally, our maturities for 2011 are 3.5% of our total debt ($129 million of mortgage debt and $58 million outstanding under our credit facility). Further, based on our
current forecasts, we expect to extend the credit facility maturity one year to September of 2012. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio, withstand
declines in operating cash flow, pay our near-term debt maturities and fund our capital expenditures programs. We may continue to opportunistically access the capital markets if favorable market conditions exist in order to further enhance our
liquidity and to fund cash needs. The chart below details our significant cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2010:



Cash Requirements.

We use cash primarily for acquisitions, capital
expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, corporate and other expenses, and dividends and distributions to stockholders and unitholders. As a REIT, Host Inc. is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income,
excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. Funds used by Host Inc. to make cash distributions are provided by Host L.P. Our primary sources of cash are cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility
and debt and equity issuances.

Below is a schedule of our debt maturities through 2013. As of December 31, 2010, our
weighted average interest rate is 6.2% and our weighted average maturity is 4.4 years. See “—Financial Condition” for more information on our debt maturities. During 2010, we took advantage of our strong financial position to
repay $463 million of debt (which is net of $722 million of debt issuances and assumptions) and $101 million of preferred stock and the corresponding preferred units.

Remaining Debt Maturities 2011—2013

(in millions)

(1)

We have the option to extend the maturity for an additional year if the applicable conditions are met.

(2)

These mortgages can be extended for one year, at our option, provided that debt coverage exceeds certain ratios and other conditions are met.

(3)

Our 2.625% Exchangeable Senior Debentures are due in 2027, but are subject to a put option by the holders on April 15, 2012. The $526 million represents the
face amount of the outstanding principal at December 31, 2010.

Capital Resources.

As of
December 31, 2010, we had over $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which was a decrease of $529 million from December 31, 2009. We also had $542 million available under our credit facility at December 31,
2010. We depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components
of our capital structure. Therefore, our financial flexibility (including our ability to incur debt, make distributions and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants, which include, among
other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, coverage and fixed charges. During 2009 and 2010, we have significantly decreased our near-term debt maturities, reduced our secured mortgage indebtedness and maintained compliance with our senior
note and credit facility covenants, despite the difficult operating and credit environment in 2009.

If,
at any time, we determine that market conditions are favorable, after taking into account our liquidity requirements, we may seek to issue and sell shares of Host Inc. common stock in registered public offerings, including through sales directly on
the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under an “at the market” offering program, or to issue and sell shares of Host Inc. preferred stock. We also may seek to cause Host L.P. to issue, in offerings exempt from registration under
the securities laws, debentures exchangeable for shares of Host Inc. common stock or senior notes. Given our total debt level and maturity schedule, we will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time, taking
advantage of favorable market conditions, when available. In February 2011, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized repurchases up to $500 million of senior notes, exchangeable debentures and mortgage debt (other than in accordance with
its terms). Separately, the Board of Directors authorized redemptions and repurchases of all or a portion of $325 million principal amount of our


/


% exchangeable debentures, and we are currently
evaluating options with respect to this security. Any redemption of the 3


/


% exchangeable debentures will not reduce the $500 million of Board authority noted above to repurchase other debt securities. We may purchase senior notes and exchangeable debentures for cash
through open



market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt, if any, will
depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and FFO per diluted share as a result of the payment of any
applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs. Accordingly, in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile, and given the movement in prevailing conditions in the capital
markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the purchase or sale of common stock, exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes. Any such transactions may, subject to
applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously.

On August 19, 2010, Host Inc. entered into a new Sales Agency
Financing Agreement with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, through which Host Inc. may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $400 million. This agreement followed the completion of
$400 million of sales under a similar agreement, also with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, that was entered into in 2009. The sales have been and will continue to be made in “at the market” offerings under SEC rules, including sales
made directly on the NYSE. BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC is acting as sales agent. Host Inc. may continue to sell shares of common stock under this program from time to time based on market conditions, although we are not under an obligation to
sell any shares. Host Inc. has approximately $100 million remaining under this program.

As of December 31, 2010,
our secured mortgage indebtedness totaled approximately $1.0 billion, which represents approximately 19% of our overall indebtedness, and is secured by 11 of our hotels. Given the flexibility provided by the structure of our balance sheet, we
will look to access the capital markets for senior notes and exchangeable debentures and the secured mortgage debt market, based on relative pricing and capacity in order to fund our cash requirements. We may, at any time, seek to access such
markets in the event that we determine that the terms and conditions available to us are advantageous, based upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other circumstances. See
“—Financial Condition” for further discussion of our restrictive covenants.

Counterparty Credit
Risk.

We are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or
services at the contracted price. We assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligation to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with
respect to cash held at various financial institutions, access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts. Our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited. Our exposure with regard to our cash and the
$542 million available under our credit facility is mitigated, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions. At December 31, 2010, the exposure risk related to our derivative contracts
totaled $18 million and the counterparties were investment grade financial institutions.

Sources and Uses of
Cash.

During 2010, our sources of cash included cash from operations, proceeds from debt and equity issuances and proceeds from the sale of assets. Uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions, capital expenditures, operating
costs, debt repayments and repurchases and distributions to equity holders. During 2011, we anticipate that our primary uses of cash will include acquisitions and investments, capital expenditures at our hotels, the repayment or repurchase of our
debt maturing in the near-term and distributions to equity holders. We anticipate that our primary sources of cash for 2011 will include cash from operations and proceeds from equity and debt issuances.

Cash Provided by Operations

. Our cash provided by operations for 2010 decreased $32 million to $520 million
compared to 2009, due primarily to timing of cash receipts from our managers, increased costs associated with debt prepayments and increased required reserves for possible legal damages.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

. Approximately $706 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2010. This
included approximately $380 million of acquisitions and deposits for future acquisitions, which is net of debt and other liabilities assumed, $309 million of capital expenditures and the investment in two junior tranches of a mortgage loan
in Europe.



Capital Expenditures.

In 2010, total capital expenditures decreased
$31 million to $309 million. Our renewal and replacement capital expenditures for 2010 were approximately $195 million, which reflects an increase of approximately 19% from 2009 levels. Our renewal and replacement capital expenditures
are generally funded by the furniture, fixture and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels (typically funded with approximately 5% of property revenues) and by our available cash. We also spent approximately $114 million in 2010 on
ROI/repositioning projects, which reflects a decrease of approximately 35% compared to 2009 levels. While capital expenditures declined in 2010, they have totaled approximately $2.5 billion over the past five years. As a result, we believe that
our properties are in a strong competitive position with respect to their market competitors.

Acquisitions/Dispositions
and Investments.

During 2010, in separate transactions, we purchased four hotel assets located in London, New York, Chicago and Rio de Janeiro, respectively, for an aggregate amount of approximately $479 million and purchased the
junior portion of a mortgage loan secured by a portfolio of hotels. We recorded the purchase price of the acquired assets and liabilities at the estimated fair value on the date of purchase. For 2010, our property acquisitions were as follows:

•

on September 30, 2010, we acquired the 245-room JW Marriott, Rio de Janeiro for approximately R80 million ($47 million);

•

on September 2, 2010, we formed a joint venture with a subsidiary of Istithmar World to purchase the 270-room W New York, Union Square. We have a
90% managing membership interest in the joint venture and, therefore, consolidate the entity. The joint venture purchased the hotel for $188 million, which, in addition to cash consideration, includes the assumption of $115 million of mortgage debt,
with a fair value of $119 million, and other liabilities of $8.5 million. The fair value of the debt was determined using the present value of future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the acquisition, the joint venture purchased
restricted cash and FF&E reserve funds at the hotel in the amount of $11 million. The joint venture acquired the hotel as part of the settlement agreement reached with the previous owners and mezzanine lenders on July 22, 2010;

•

on August 11, 2010, we acquired the 424-room Westin Chicago River North for approximately $165 million; and

•

on July 22, 2010, we acquired the leasehold interest in the 266-room Le Méridien Piccadilly in London, England for £64 million
($98 million), including cash consideration of approximately £31 million ($47 million) and the assumption of a £33 million ($51 million) mortgage. As part of the purchase of the leasehold interest, we acquired
restricted cash and working capital at the hotel in the amount of £4 million ($6 million). In connection with the acquisition, we assumed a capital lease obligation which we valued at £38 million ($58 million). The capital
lease obligation is included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and increased the book value of the leasehold interest purchased. We also recorded a deferred tax liability of £19 million ($30 million), a deferred tax asset of
£11 million ($17 million) and goodwill of £8 million ($13 million) related to the difference in the hotel valuation measured at fair value on the acquisition date and the tax basis of the asset. We drew
£37 million ($56 million) from our credit facility in order to fund the cash portion of the acquisition.

Additionally, during 2010, we disposed of two non-core properties where we believed the potential for profitability growth was low. Proceeds from these sales were approximately $12 million.

While we continue to actively explore potential acquisitions, given the nature of the transactions, we cannot assure you that
we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotel properties that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase. We may acquire additional properties through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios,
joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs. We anticipate that future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from equity offerings of Host Inc., or issuance of OP units by Host
L.P., but potentially also from the proceeds from sales of properties from our existing portfolio, the incurrence of debt, available cash or advances under our credit facility.



The following table summarizes significant investment activities and dispositions that have
been completed as of December 31, 2010 (in millions):

(1)

The investment price represents our 90% interest in the joint venture that acquired the hotel, including our portion of the assumption by the joint venture of a $115
million mortgage loan (which was subsequently repaid in 2010) and other liabilities valued at $8.5 million.

(2)

Includes $5 million of reserves which were returned by the hotel manager.

Cash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities

. Net cash used in financing activities was $343 million for 2010, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $698 million
in 2009. During 2010, cash used consisted of debt repayments or repurchases and equity repurchases of approximately $1.3 billion, while we received proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion through the issuance of debt and equity securities.

Debt Transactions.

During 2010, we completed several significant debt transactions that provided financial
flexibility and extended our debt maturities.

The following table summarizes significant debt issuances and assumptions, net

Equity/Capital Transactions.

During 2010, Host Inc. issued the remaining 8.1 million
shares of common stock available under the 2009 Sales Agency Financing Agreement with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC at an average price of $13.58 per share for proceeds of $109 million, net of $1 million of commissions. Under the 2009
program, Host Inc. issued a total of 36.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $11.09 per share for proceeds of $396 million, net of $4 million of commissions. On August 19, 2010, Host Inc. entered into a new
Sales Agency Financing Agreement with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC on similar terms, through which Host Inc. may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $400 million. The sales
are, and will continue to be, made in “at the market” offerings under SEC rules, including sales made directly on the NYSE. BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC is acting as sales agent. During the fourth quarter, Host Inc. issued approximately
15.1 million shares of common stock through this new program at an average price of $16.52 per share for proceeds of $248 million, net of $2.5 million of commissions. Since the inception of the new program, Host Inc. has issued approximately
18.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $15.96 per share for proceeds of $297 million, net of $3 million of commissions. Host Inc. may continue to sell shares of common stock under its new program from time to time
based on market conditions, although it is not under an obligation to sell any shares. In exchange for the cash proceeds of the shares issued by Host Inc., Host L.P. issued OP units to Host Inc. based on the conversion ratio of 1.021494 shares per
unit. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $100 million is remaining under the new program.

On June 18, 2010, Host Inc. redeemed 4,034,300 shares of its 8


/


% Class E cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a redemption
price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued dividends. Due to the redemption of the preferred stock, the original issuance costs for the Class E preferred stock have been treated as a deemed dividend and have been reflected as a deduction to net income
available to common stockholders for the purpose of calculating Host Inc.’s basic and diluted earnings per share. As a result of the redemption, Host Inc. currently has no preferred stock outstanding. Simultaneously, Host L.P. redeemed its
Class E preferred OP units, with the identical accounting treatment for the calculation of its basic and diluted earnings per unit.



During 2010, Host Inc.’s cash common stock dividend payments decreased $22 million
from $42 million in 2009 to $20 million and Host L.P.’s cash common unit distribution decreased $23 million from $43 million in 2009 to $20 million. The 2009 dividend and distribution payments included the fourth
quarter 2008 distribution of $.05 per common share or unit and the $.025 per common share or unit cash portion of the fourth quarter 2009 distribution, while the 2010 dividend and distribution payments include the $.01 per common share or unit
distribution for each of the first three quarters of 2010. Subsequent to Host Inc.’s stock dividend in December of 2009, Host L.P.’s distributions on common OP units are based on the conversion factor used to convert common OP units into
shares of Host Inc. common stock, which factor is 1.021494.

The following table summarizes significant equity transactions
that have been completed as of December 31, 2010 (in millions):

(1)

In exchange for the cash consideration received from the issuance of these shares, Host L.P. issued to Host Inc. approximately 26 million common OP units.

(2)

Host L.P. redeemed its equivalent preferred OP units.

(3)

In exchange for the cash consideration received from the issuance of these shares, Host L.P. issued to Host Inc. approximately 28 million common OP units.

(4)

In exchange for the cash consideration received from the issuance of these shares, Host L.P. issued to Host Inc. 75.75 million common OP units.

Financial Condition

As of December 31, 2010, our total debt was approximately $5.5 billion of which 90% carried a fixed rate of interest. Total debt was comprised of (in millions):



(1)

The Series U senior notes were exchanged for Series V senior notes in February 2011.

(2)

The assets securing mortgage debt represents the book value of real estate assets, net of accumulated depreciation. These amounts do not represent the current market
value of the assets.

Aggregate debt maturities at December 31, 2010 are as follows (in millions):

(1)

The debt maturing in 2011 includes $58 million outstanding on our credit facility, for which we have the option to extend the maturity for an additional year,
subject to the satisfaction of certain financial covenants.

(2)

In January 2011, we extended the maturity of the $50 million Le Méridien Piccadilly mortgage to January 20, 2012 and, therefore, have included it in
the 2012 maturities. The mortgage loan can be extended for an additional one-year period, subject to the satisfaction of certain financial covenants.

(3)

The debt maturing in 2012, 2014 and 2015 includes $526 million, $325 million and $400 million, respectively, of our exchangeable senior debentures that
are subject to a put option by holders in those years.

Senior Notes.

The following summary is a
description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by Host L.P., which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes at
specified dates in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.’s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior
to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P. The notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The guarantees and
pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture, as well as our credit facility, certain other senior debt, and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit
facility. The pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters. Because our leverage ratio is below this threshold, we have the right to release all pledges at any time.
In October 2005, we exercised this right for pledges of capital stock that would have been otherwise required subsequent to this date.

Restrictive Covenants

. Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various
conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0x. This ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving
effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the
extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and approximately
$31 million of non-cash interest expense recorded in 2010 related to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Our subsidiaries are subject to the restrictive
covenants in the indenture, however, in certain circumstances, we are permitted to designate certain subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These unrestricted subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants (unless they are
guarantors) and may engage in transactions to dispose of or encumber their assets or otherwise incur additional indebtedness without complying with the restrictive covenants in the indenture. If we were to designate additional subsidiaries as
unrestricted subsidiaries, neither the EBITDA generated by nor the interest expense allocated to these



entities would be included in our ratio calculations. Other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness, Host Inc.’s ability to pay dividends and Host L.P.’s ability to make
distributions include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), excluding intangible assets, and secured indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets. So long as
we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, we may make preferred or common OP unit distributions and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture, including
debt incurred in connection with an acquisition. In addition, even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions, we are still permitted to incur certain types of debt, including (i) credit facility
debt, (ii) refinancing debt, (iii) up to $300 million or $400 million, depending on the series of senior notes, of mortgage debt whose proceeds would be used to repay debt under credit facility (and permanently reduce our ability to
borrow under the credit facility by such amount), and (iv) up to $100 million or $150 million, depending on the series of senior notes, of other debt. We also are permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are
necessary to maintain Host Inc.’s REIT status.

Our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary
matters, such as Host L.P.’s ability to make distributions on, redeem or repurchase its OP units; make investments; permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries; sell assets; guarantee indebtedness; enter into
transactions with affiliates; create certain liens; and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. Our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets (as defined in the indenture as undepreciated
property book value) of not less than 125% of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages. This coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to
incur debt or make distributions discussed above (whose consequences, where we fall below the coverage level, are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions, but which would not otherwise cause a default under our
senior notes indenture).

We are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture. The
following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture as of December 31, 2010:

Exchangeable Debentures.

As of December 31, 2010, we have three series of exchangeable senior debentures
outstanding: $400 million of 2


/


% debentures
that were issued on December 22, 2009 (the “2009 Debentures”), $526 million of


/


% debentures that were issued on March 23,
2007 and $325 million of 3


/


% debentures that
were issued on March 16, 2004 (the “2004 Debentures”). We refer to these collectively as the “Debentures.” The Debentures are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes. Holders have the right to require us
to purchase the Debentures at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest (the “put option”) on certain dates subsequent to their respective issuances. Holders of the Debentures also have the right to
exchange the Debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions, including at any time at which the closing price of Host Inc.’s common stock is more than 120% (for the 2004 Debentures) or 130% (for the 2007 and 2009 Debentures) of the
exchange price per share for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days prior to the date on which the Debentures have been called for redemption. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, any of the
Debentures at any time subsequent to each of their respective redemption dates at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. If, at any time, we elect to redeem the Debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash
redemption price, we would expect the holders to elect to exchange the Debentures at the respective exchange value rather than receive the cash redemption price. The exchange value is equal to the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the price of
Host Inc.’s common stock. Upon exchange, the 2004 Debentures would be exchanged for Host Inc.’s common stock, the 2007 Debentures would be exchanged for a combination of cash (for the principal balance of the debentures) and Host
Inc.’s common stock (for the remainder of the exchange value) and the 2009 Debentures would be exchanged for Host Inc.’s common stock, cash or a combination thereof, at our option. Currently, none of the Debentures are exchangeable by
holders.



The following chart details our outstanding Debentures as of December 31, 2010:

We separately account for the liability and equity components of our exchangeable debentures to
reflect the fair value of the liability component based on our non-convertible borrowing cost at the issuance date. Accordingly, for the Debentures, we record the liability components thereof at fair value as of the date of issuance and amortize the
resulting discount as an increase to interest expense over the expected life of the debt; however, there is no effect on our cash interest payments. We measured the fair value of the debt components of the 2009 Debentures, 2007 Debentures and 2004
Debentures at issuance based on effective interest rates of 6.9%, 6.5% and 6.8%, respectively. As a result, we attributed $247 million of the proceeds received to the conversion feature of the Debentures. This amount represents the excess
proceeds received over the fair value of the debt at the date of issuance and is included in Host Inc.’s additional paid-in capital and Host L.P.’s partner’s capital on the consolidated balance sheets. The following chart details the
initial allocations between the debt and equity components of the debentures, net of the original issue discount, based on the effective interest rate at the time of issuance, as well as the debt balances at December 31, 2010:

Credit Facility.

On May 25, 2007, we entered into a second amended and restated bank
credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Citicorp North America Inc., Société Générale and Calyon New York Branch, as Co-Documentation
Agents and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of $600 million. During any period in which our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to
such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount under the credit facility to exceed $300 million. The credit facility also includes subcommitments for (i) the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of
$10 million, and (ii) loans in certain foreign currencies in an aggregate amount of $300 million, (A) $150 million of which may be loaned to certain of our Canadian subsidiaries in Canadian Dollars, and
(B) $300 million of which may be loaned to us in Pounds Sterling and Euros. The credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of September 2011. We have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are
met as of September 2011. These conditions include the payment of a fee to the lenders, that no default or event of default exists and the maintenance of a leverage ratio below 6.75x. Subject to certain conditions, we also have the option to
increase the amount of the facility by up to $190 million to the extent that any one or more lenders, whether or not currently party to the credit facility, commits to be a lender to the extent of such amount.



On July 20, 2010, we drew £37 million ($56 million) under our credit
facility in order to fund the acquisition of the leasehold interest in the Le Méridien Piccadilly. Based on our leverage at December 31, 2010, we have $542 million of available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit
facility.

Collateral and Guarantees.

The obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our
existing subsidiaries (which are the same subsidiaries that guarantee our senior notes) and are currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The pledges, but not the guarantees, are permitted to be released in the
event that certain conditions are satisfied, including the requirement that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters. As a result of having satisfied such conditions, currently we are not required to pledge our equity
interests in any newly acquired or newly formed subsidiary, and at our election, we may obtain a release of all existing pledges for so long as our leverage ratio remains below 6.0x. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility, as
well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture, interest rate swap agreements, and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility.

Prepayments.

The loans under the credit facility are required to be prepaid, subject to certain exceptions, with excess proceeds
from certain asset sales. Voluntary prepayments of the loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty.

Financial Covenants.

The credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. Currently, we are permitted to make borrowings
and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio does not exceed 7.25x and our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.15x. If our leverage ratio
equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the credit facility to exceed $300 million. However, to the extent our borrowings under the credit facility
revolver exceed $300 million on the date that our leverage ratio exceeds 7.0x, we are not required to repay the excess for one year. The financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility.
So long as there are no amounts outstanding, we would not be in default if we did not satisfy the financial covenants and we would not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to regain compliance with the
financial covenants. These calculations are performed in accordance with our credit facility based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they
occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit
facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan in order to establish the debt at fair value and non-cash interest expense recorded as a result of the adoption of accounting standards relating to our
exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a “net debt” concept, under which cash
and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million is deducted from our total debt balance.

We are in compliance with all of
our financial covenants under the credit facility. The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of December 31, 2010:

(a)

If at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will lower to 1.5x.

Interest and Fees.

We pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates plus a margin that is
set with reference to our leverage ratio. In the case of LIBOR-based borrowings in U.S. Dollars, as



well as Euros and Pounds Sterling denominated borrowings, the rate of interest ranges from 65 basis points to 150 basis points over LIBOR. We also have the option to pay interest based on the
higher of the overnight Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points and the Prime Lending Rate plus, in both cases, the applicable spread ranging from 0 to 50 basis points. Based on our leverage ratio at December 31, 2010 of 5.0x, we can borrow at
a rate of LIBOR plus 90 basis points or Prime plus 0 basis points. To the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment of 10 to 15 basis points, depending
on our average revolver usage during the applicable period.

Other Covenants and Events of Default.

The credit
facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x. In particular, at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, we will not be subject to
limitations on capital expenditures, and the limitations on acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes
indenture. Additionally, the credit facility’s restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and distributions are generally consistent with our senior notes indenture. These provisions, under certain circumstances, limit debt
incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing, and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain Host Inc.’s tax status as a REIT.

The credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the
occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated, the lenders’ commitments may be terminated and the lenders may foreclose on the collateral. In addition, upon the
occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the credit facility will automatically become due and payable and the lenders’ commitments will automatically terminate.

Mortgage and Other Debt

. As of December 31, 2010, we had 11 hotels that were secured by mortgage debt.
Substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets, except in instances of fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2010, secured debt represented approximately 19% of
our total debt and our aggregate secured debt had an average interest rate of 4.7% and an average maturity of 2.7 years.



The following table summarizes our outstanding debt and scheduled amortization and
maturities related to mortgage and other debt as of December 31, 2010 (in millions):

(1)

This floating rate mortgage is based on LIBOR plus 118 basis points. Beginning in January 2011, we have entered into an agreement that caps the LIBOR rate at 2%. The
rate shown reflects the rate at December 31, 2010. We have the right to extend the maturity for one-year subject to certain conditions.

(2)

This floating rate mortgage is based on LIBOR plus 600 basis points, with a LIBOR floor of 1.5% and a LIBOR cap of 3%. The rate shown reflects the rate in effect at
December 31, 2010.

(3)

During 2009, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements for the total notional amount outstanding on this loan. The rate shown reflects the weighted average
interest rate in effect at December 31, 2010. The balance reflects the book value at December 31, 2010, as adjusted, due to the implementation of fair value hedge accounting. The face amount at December 31, 2010 was $300 million.

(4)

Beginning in 2013, the interest rate on this loan increases a minimum of 500 basis points and all excess cash (as defined in the loan agreement) generated by the
partnership that owns this property is applied to principal; however, the loan can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date. The amortization presented is the minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate, but does
not include additional principal payments based on excess cash flow.

(5)

Other mortgage debt consists of individual mortgage debt amounts that are less than $40 million, have an average interest rate of 5.2% at December 31, 2010
and mature through 2011.

(6)

Industrial revenue bonds and other consist of loans with an average interest rate of 7.1% that mature through 2016, and capital leases with varying interest rates and
maturity dates.

Mortgage Debt of Consolidated and Unconsolidated Partner Interests.

For the
entities that we consolidate in our financial statements that have third party non-controlling partnership interests, the portion of mortgage debt included in the above table that is attributable to the non-controlling interests, based on their
percentage of ownership of the partnerships, is approximately $68 million. Additionally, we have non-controlling interests in partnerships and joint ventures that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method. The portion
of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships attributable to us, based on our percentage of ownership of the partnerships, was $303 million at December 31, 2010. This debt balance is attributable to our 32.1% ownership interest in
the European joint venture. The mortgage debt related to our European joint venture hotels contains operating covenants that could result in the joint venture being required to escrow cash from operations or make principal repayments without
penalty. The debt of all of our unconsolidated partnerships is non-recourse to us. See “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations.”



Distribution/Dividend Policy

. Host Inc. is required to distribute at least 90%
of its annual taxable income, excluding net capital gain, to its stockholders in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash.
Funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends are provided through distributions from Host L.P. As of February 18, 2011, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately 98.4% of the common OP units. The remaining 1.6% of the common OP units are held by
various third-party limited partners. Each OP unit may be redeemed by the holders thereof for cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. The current conversion ratio is 1.021494 shares
of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit.

Investors should take into account the 1.6% non-controlling position of Host L.P.
OP units when analyzing dividend payments by Host Inc. to its stockholders, as these holders share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by Host L.P. to holders of its corresponding OP units. For example, if Host Inc. paid a $1 per
share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common unit distribution by Host L.P. to Host Inc., as well as to other common OP unitholders.

Host Inc. reinstated its quarterly common dividend payment and paid a $0.01 per share dividend with respect to its common stock beginning
in the first quarter of 2010. Host Inc.’s policy on common dividends is generally to distribute, over time, 100% of its taxable income and to pay a dividend of at least $0.01 per share per quarter even if we do not generate taxable income. Host
Inc. intends to declare a dividend of $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2011. The amount of any future dividend will be determined by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors.

During 2010, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors declared dividends of $0.04 per share ($0.01 per share for each quarter) on Host
Inc.’s common stock. Accordingly, Host L.P. made a distribution of $0.04085976 per unit on its common OP units.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

We are party to various
transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities (which we refer to as “off-balance sheet arrangements”) under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees. As of December 31,
2010, we are party to the following material off-balance sheet arrangements:

European Joint Venture

. In March
2006, we formed a joint venture, HHR Euro CV, to acquire hotels in Europe. We serve as the general partner for the European joint venture and have a 32.1% ownership interest (including our general and limited partner interests). Due to the ownership
structure and unilateral right of the non-Host limited partners to cause the dissolution and liquidation of the European joint venture at any time, it is not consolidated in our financial statements. Our investment balance at December 31, 2010
in the joint venture is approximately €98 million ($135 million). The initial term of the European joint venture is ten years (ending in 2016), subject to two one-year extensions with partner approval.

As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate size of the European joint venture was approximately €1.1 billion
($1.4 billion), including total capital contributions of approximately €445 million ($597 million), of which a total of approximately €144 million ($193 million) was primarily from our contribution of cash and the
Sheraton Warsaw Hotel & Towers. Under the joint venture’s partnership agreement, the aggregate size can increase to approximately €540 million of equity (of which approximately €170 million would be contributed by
Host L.P.) and, once all funds have been invested, and including debt, would represent approximately €1.5 billion of assets.

During 2010, the partners amended and restated the agreement. The amendments were (i) to extend the commitment period during which the European joint venture may make additional equity investments
from May 2010 to May 2013, (ii) to reflect an internal restructuring of one of our joint venture partners, and (iii) to reflect changes as a result of the acquisition of the equity interests of subsidiaries previously owned by a separate
TRS joint venture with the same partners, which subsidiaries currently lease, as tenant, five of the hotels owned by the European joint venture. After the partnership agreement was amended, the separate TRS joint venture was dissolved.



The partners are currently negotiating the terms of an expansion to the European joint
venture, which would extend the term for another ten years and involve the commitment of €450 million of new equity through the establishment of a fund of funds. While the terms and structure of the expansion have not been finalized, it is
anticipated that each of the current partners in the joint venture, including Host, would own 33.3% of a new sub fund as limited partners, and a Host entity would own the remaining 0.1% as the general partner. We would anticipate transferring
our leasehold interest in Le Méridien Piccadilly to the joint venture as part of the expansion. The negotiations for the expansion of the European joint venture are ongoing and there can be no assurances that the terms, if completed,
will not differ materially from those outlined above.

The European joint venture has €706 million of mortgage debt,
none of which is recourse to us. In 2010, we negotiated agreements with the lenders of a significant portion of this debt in order to cure actual or potential covenant defaults, cash sweeps or non-payment defaults. During the second quarter 2010,
the European joint venture completed an agreement with the lender holding mortgages totaling €70.5 million on its portfolio of three hotels located in Brussels, under which the lender waived all breaches of financial covenants.
Additionally, during the third quarter 2010, the European joint venture negotiated an agreement with the lenders of mortgage loans totaling €342 million due in 2013 to amend the loans’ financial covenants for two years in exchange for
a deposit of approximately €10 million in escrow to fund debt service or, in certain cases, capital expenditures and commitments to fund planned incremental capital expenditures. These loans are secured by a portfolio of six hotels located
in Spain, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom. These mortgage loans are non-recourse to us and a default under these loans does not trigger a default under any of our debt.

We have entered into four foreign currency forward purchase contracts in order to hedge the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment. We hedged
€80 million (approximately $114 million) of our investment and the forward purchase will occur between August 2011 and October 2014. During 2010 and 2009, we recorded approximately $5 million and $(4) million, respectively,
related to the change in the fair value of the forward purchase contracts. The current value of the forward contracts of $7 million is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheet. The derivatives are
considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, and, in accordance with applicable hedge accounting guidance, are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive
income within Host Inc.’s stockholders’ equity portion and Host L.P.’s partners’ capital portion of their balance sheets. For additional detail on the foreign currency forward purchase contracts and our exposure to changes in

On March 25, 2008, we entered into a joint venture, structured as a Singapore Corporation, to explore
investment opportunities in various markets throughout Asia, including China, Japan, India, Vietnam and Australia. We own a 25% interest in the Asian joint venture. The initial term of the Asian joint venture is for a period of seven years. Due to
the ownership structure of the Asian joint venture, and our partner’s rights to cause its dissolution and liquidation at any time, it is not consolidated in our financial statements. On July 20, 2010, the Asian joint venture reached a
joint venture agreement with Accor S. A. and InterGlobe Enterprises Limited to develop seven properties totaling approximately 1,750 rooms in three major cities in India: Bangalore, Chennai and Delhi. The Asian joint venture will invest
approximately $50 million to acquire approximately 36% of the interest in the India joint venture. The properties will be managed by Accor under the Pullman, Novotel and ibis brands. Development of the properties is underway, and the first hotel,
the ibis Bangalore, is expected to open in the second quarter of 2011.

Hospitality Properties Trust Relationship

.
During 2010, we owned leasehold interests in 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties and 18 Residence Inn by Marriott properties, which hotels were sold to HPT and leased back to us in 1995 and 1996. In conjunction with our conversion to a REIT we
entered into subleases for these 71 properties with a third party. In late June 2010, HPT sent notices of default because the subtenants failed to meet certain net worth covenants, which would have triggered an event of default by us under the
master leases between us and HPT. As a result, we terminated the subleases effective July 6, 2010 and resumed acting as owner under the management agreements. The subtenants remain obligated to us for outstanding rent payments to the extent
that operating cash generated by the hotels is less than rent that would have been paid under the terminated subleases, although they have not funded this obligation since the termination of the subleases.



Effective upon termination of the subleases, we recorded the operations of the hotels rather
than rental income for the remaining portion of 2010. As a result, we recorded $123 million of hotel revenues for the 71 properties, as well as $44 million of rental income earned prior to the termination of the subleases in 2010, which
are included in other revenues on the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, we recorded $96 million of hotel expenses related to the 71 properties, as well as $84 million of rental expense due to HPT in 2010, which are
included in other property-level expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The property revenues and rental income recorded, less the hotel expenses and rental expenses, resulted in a loss of approximately $13 million and
$1 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and a gain of $4 million in 2008.

We terminated the master lease on the
18 Residence Inn properties in accordance with its terms effective December 31, 2010, at which time HPT paid us $17.2 million of deferred proceeds related to the initial sale of these properties and additional amounts held in a tenant
collection account. On November 23, 2010, we gave notice that we will not extend the term of the master lease on the 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties, which will result in the termination and expiration of that lease on December 31,
2012. At the expiration of that master lease, HPT is obligated to pay us deferred proceeds related to the initial sale of the 53 Courtyard properties of approximately $51 million, subject to damages arising out of an event of default, if any,
under the master lease, plus additional amounts held in a tenant collection account.

Tax Sharing
Arrangements

. Under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies (such as Marriott International, Inc., HMS Host and Barceló Crestline Corporation), we are obligated to pay certain taxes (federal, state, local and foreign,
including any related interest and penalties) relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us. For example, a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was
owned by us. This adjustment could produce a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement. Additionally, under the partnership agreement between Host Inc. and Host L.P., Host L.P. is obligated to pay certain taxes
(federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) incurred by Host Inc., as well as any liabilities the IRS may successfully assert against Host Inc. We do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing
arrangements to be material.

Tax Indemnification Agreements.

For reasons relating to federal and state income tax
considerations of the former and current owners of three hotels, we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels, or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel. Two of these agreements expired in 2010
and were not renewed and the third will expire in 2028.

Guarantees

. We have certain guarantees, which consist of
commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt, that are not on our books due to various dispositions, spin-offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an
unrelated party. We consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote. The largest guarantees (by dollar amount) are listed below:

•

We remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non-lodging properties. These primarily represent certain divested restaurants
that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments. The aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately $18 million as of December 31, 2010.

•

In 1997, we owned Leisure Park Venture Limited Partnership, which owns and operates a senior living facility. We no longer have an ownership interest
in the partnership, but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to $14.7 million of municipal bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority through their maturity in 2027. However, to the
extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee, we have been indemnified by Barceló Crestline Corporation, who, in turn, is indemnified by the current owner of the facility.

•

In connection with the sale of two hotels in January 2005, we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases. The
future minimum lease payments are approximately $13 million through the full term of the leases, including renewal options. We believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote, and in each case, we have been indemnified by
the purchaser of the hotel.



Information on other guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in
Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.

Contractual Obligations.

The table below summarizes our
obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt, future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases, projected capital expenditures and other long-term liabilities, each as of December 31, 2010 (in
millions):

(1)

The amounts shown include amortization of principal, debt maturities and estimated interest payments. Interest payments have been included in the long-term debt
obligations based on the weighted average interest rate.

(2)

Our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels. Under our contracts, we have the ability to defer some of these
expenditures into later years.

(3)

The amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense. Under terms of our management agreements, we have deferred payment of
management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owner’s priority to us. The timing of the payments, if any, is based on future operations, the termination of
the management agreement or the sale of the hotel, and, is therefore, not determinable. The estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at
the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of
judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing
basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates.

Purchase Price Allocations to Hotels Acquired in a Business Combination

.

Investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost and allocated to land, property and
equipment, identifiable intangible assets, other assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value. Any remaining unallocated investment would be treated as goodwill. Property and equipment are recorded at fair value and allocated to
buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties. Fair values are based on the exit price (i.e. the price that would be received to sell an asset or
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date). We evaluate several factors, including market data for similar assets, expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement
cost for the assets, to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets.

Other items that we
evaluate in a business combination include identifiable intangible assets, capital lease assets and obligations and goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets are typically assumed contracts, including ground and retail leases and management and
franchise agreements, which are recorded at fair value, although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms. Above-market and below-market contract values are



based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding
contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the contract. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable term of the related agreements. Capital lease obligations
that are assumed as a part of the acquisition of a leasehold interest are fair valued and included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we will record the corresponding right-to-use assets. Classification of a lease does not change if
it is part of a business combination. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other
market data, including third-party appraisals and valuations. In certain situations, a deferred tax liability is created due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the asset at the acquisition date, which also may result in a
goodwill asset being recorded. The goodwill that is recorded as a result of this difference is not subject to amortization. Furthermore, acquisition-related costs, such as due diligence, legal and accounting fees, are not capitalized or applied
in determining the fair value of the acquired assets.

Impairment Testing.

We analyze our assets for
impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying values thereof may not be recoverable. We consider a property to be impaired when the sum of future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining
estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset. For impaired assets, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the property’s carrying value over its fair value. To the extent that a property has a substantial
remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life, it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the
property’s carrying value. In the absence of other factors, we assume that the estimated life is equal to the GAAP depreciable life, because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our
management agreements. We adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise, such as an expiring ground lease, or it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to its
previously expected useful life. We also consider the effect of regular renewal and replacement capital expenditures on the estimable life of our properties, including critical infrastructure, which is regularly maintained and then replaced at the
end of its useful life.

We test for impairment in several situations, including when a property has a current or projected
loss from operations, when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when other events, trends, contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has
occurred and an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the impairment of our assets, we make many assumptions and estimates, including:

•

projected cash flows, both from operations and the eventual disposition;

•

expected useful life and holding period;

•

future required capital expenditures; and

•

fair values, including consideration of capitalization rates, discount rates and comparable selling prices.

While we consider all of the above indicators as a preliminary indicator to determine if the carrying value may not be recovered by
undiscounted cash flows, we reviewed the actual year-to-date and the projected cash flows from operations to identify properties with actual or projected annual operating losses or minimal operating profit as of December 31, 2010. The projected
cash flows are prepared by our third-party managers and consider items such as booking pace, occupancy, room rate and property-level operating costs. We review the projections and may adjust them as we deem appropriate. As a result of our review, we
identified seven properties that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Management considered a range of RevPAR and
operating margins compared to prior years’ operating results in evaluating the projected cash flows from operations. The operating results of our portfolio were significantly affected by the recessionary climate in 2009 and the first half of
2010. To appropriately evaluate if the assets carrying value was recoverable, we projected a growth rate such that the individual properties would return to normalized levels of operations within five years and thereafter grow at a stabilized rate
of 3% over the remaining estimable lives of the properties. This stabilized growth rate is lower than the historical growth rate for the entire industry over the period from 1997 through 2007. Based on this test, no properties exhibited an impaired
value at December 31, 2010. For purposes of this test, if we had assumed a growth rate of 0% after the return to normalized level of operations one of the seven properties identified above would have required further analysis. Management
believes its assumptions and estimates reflect current market conditions.



Other-than-Temporary Impairment of an Investment.

We review our equity method
investments for other-than-temporary impairment based on the occurrence of any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an other-than-temporary basis. Triggering events can include a
decline in distributable cash flows from the investment, a change in the expected hold period or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment. Our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel
properties; therefore, we will generally have few observable inputs and will determine the fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment, as well as considering the impact of other elements (i.e. control premiums, etc.). We
use certain inputs, such as available third-party appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties, to estimate the expected cash flows. If an equity method investment is impaired, a loss is recorded for the difference between
the fair value and the carrying value of the investment.

Classification of Assets as “Held for
Sale”.

Our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable prior to classifying it as such, will be completed within one year and that actions required to
complete the sale are unlikely to change or that it is unlikely the planned sale will be withdrawn. This policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known
until purchase agreements are executed, the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner. Specifically, we will typically classify properties
that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met:

•

Host Inc.’s Board of Directors has approved the sale (to the extent the dollar amount of the sale requires Board approval);

•

a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed;

•

the buyer has committed a significant amount of non-refundable cash; and

•

no significant contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner.

To the extent that a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of
the property, we will record an impairment loss.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense.

Depreciation
expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. The lives of the assets are based on a
number of assumptions, including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets, as well as specific market and economic conditions. While management believes its estimates are reasonable, a change in the estimated
lives could affect depreciation expense and net income (loss) or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels.

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets.

We have approximately $117 million, net of a valuation allowance of
$44 million, of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2010. The objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax
liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company’s financial statements or tax returns. We have considered various factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary
differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the $117 million of net
deferred tax assets in the future. When a determination is made that all, or a portion, of the deferred tax assets may not be realized, an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period.

Valuation of Derivative Contracts.

We will occasionally enter into derivative products, including interest rate and
foreign currency swaps, caps and collars. Derivative instruments are subject to fair value reporting at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income (loss) or accumulated other comprehensive income, based
on the applicable hedge accounting guidance. We estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations, which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the



discounted future cash receipts and the discounted future expected cash payments. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the
respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit
enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. The variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves. The
values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change. Any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations. The fair
value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from year-to-year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity.

Stock Compensation.

We recognize costs resulting from Host Inc.’s share-based payment transactions over their vesting periods. We classify share-based payment awards granted in
exchange for employee services as either equity awards or liability awards. The classification of Host Inc.’s restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options. Equity classified awards
are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. Liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. These awards were classified as liability awards due to settlement features that allow the recipient to have a
percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax withholding requirements. The value of these restricted stock awards, less estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in
exchange for the award – the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service.

During 2009, Host Inc. implemented an employee stock plan for our senior management that included the following awards:

Restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions.

These awards vest based on the total shareholder return
relative to other REITs and lodging companies. They are classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement features and are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. We utilize a simulation, or Monte Carlo model, to determine the fair
value of Host Inc.’s restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions. The utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of Host Inc.’s common stock, risk-free
interest rates, the risk profile of our common shares compared to our peer group and the amount of Host Inc.’s awards expected to be forfeited.

Restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance conditions.

These awards are earned based on the employee achieving a specified performance target, which will be based on the
employee’s specific management business objectives. Compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable of achievement. If a performance condition has more than one outcome that is
probable of achievement, recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome. These awards classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement provisions. Therefore, the value of the shares to be
issued by Host Inc. will be based on Host Inc.’s share price on the reporting date.

Stock option awards.

The
stock option awards are equity classified awards, as they do not include cash settlement features. Therefore, the value of the award is determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and is not adjusted for future changes in the fair
value. Vesting for these awards is based on service conditions. The utilization of the binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the amount of
our awards expected to be forfeited.

Other awards.

During 2009, Host Inc. granted restricted stock awards to all
of its employees, with vesting based on service conditions. These awards are equity classified awards as they do not have cash settlement features similar to that for awards to senior management.

Consolidation Policies.

Judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture
entities in terms of the evaluation of control, including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights, as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests. We consolidate
subsidiaries when we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity. For those partnerships and joint ventures of which we are the general partner,



we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would preclude the assumption of control as the general partner. Limited partner rights which would preclude presumption
of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the limited partnership or otherwise remove us, as the general partner, without cause and substantive participating rights, primarily through voting rights.

We also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they should be considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”). If
a subsidiary is a VIE, it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for VIEs. We consider an entity a VIE if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such
investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. In accordance with ASC 810, we reviewed our subsidiaries to determine if (i) any of our subsidiaries or
affiliates should be considered VIEs, and (ii) whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in the characteristics of these entities.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The operations of foreign subsidiaries are maintained in their functional currency, which is generally the local currency, and then translated to U.S. dollars
using the average exchange rates for the period. The assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other
comprehensive income.

Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency for each entity using the
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at period end exchange rates. The resulting exchange differences on translation are recorded in gain (loss) on
foreign currency transactions and derivatives, except when deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income as qualifying net investment hedges.

Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics

We present certain operating
statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses and adjusted operating profit) for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis. We define our comparable hotels as
properties (i) that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results, whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared, and
(ii) that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large-scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared.

Of the 113 hotels that we owned on December 31, 2010, 108 have been classified as comparable hotels.

The operating results of the following hotels that we owned or leased as of December 31, 2010 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

•

Le Méridien Piccadilly (acquired leasehold interest in July 2010);

•

Westin Chicago River North (acquired in August 2010);

•

W New York, Union Square (acquired in September 2010);

•

JW Marriott, Rio de Janeiro (acquired in September 2010);

•

San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina (business disruption due to significant renovations); and

•

53 Courtyard by Marriott properties leased from HPT (sublease was terminated in July 2010).

The operating results of the eight hotels we disposed of in 2010 and 2009, as well as 18 Residence Inn properties we leased from HPT
until December 31, 2010 are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein. Moreover, because these statistics and operating results are for our hotel properties, they exclude results for our non-hotel properties and
other real estate investments.

We evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region
and property type. These divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry.



Geographic regions consist of the following (only states in which we own hotels are listed):

•

Pacific—California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington;

•

Mountain—Arizona and Colorado;

•

North Central—Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio;

•

South Central—Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas;

•

New England—Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire;

•

Mid-Atlantic—Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York;

•

DC Metro—Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.;

•

Atlanta—Georgia and North Carolina;

•

Florida—Florida; and

•

International—Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

Property types consist of the following:

•

Urban—Hotels located in primary business districts of major cities;

•

Suburban—Hotels located in office parks or smaller secondary markets;

•

Resort/conference—Hotels located in resort/conference destinations such as Arizona, Florida, Hawaii and Southern California; and

•

Airport—Hotels located at or near airports.

Reporting Periods.

For Consolidated Statement of
Operations.

The results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers. Our hotel managers use different reporting periods. Marriott, the manager of a significant percentage of our properties, uses a year
ending on the Friday closest to December 31 and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its U.S. and Canadian Marriott-managed hotels. In contrast,
other managers of our hotels, such as Hyatt and Starwood, report results on a monthly basis. Host Inc., as a REIT, is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year basis. As a result, we elected to adopt the reporting
periods used by Marriott, modified so that our fiscal year always ends on December 31 to comply with REIT rules. Our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as Marriott, but our fourth quarter ends on December 31 and our
full year results, as reported in our statement of operations, always includes the same number of days as the calendar year.

Two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are: (1) quarterly start dates will usually differ between years, except for
the first quarter which always commences on January 1, and (2) our first and fourth quarters of operations and year-to-date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years. For example, set forth below are
the quarterly start and end dates for 2011, 2010 and 2009. Note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations. In contrast, the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations.

While the reporting
calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by Marriott, another consequence of our calendar is that we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter-end until the following quarter
because our hotel managers that use a monthly reporting period do not make mid-month results available to us. Hence, the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter-end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following
quarter for those hotel managers (covering approximately 43% of total revenues of our hotels). As a result, our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers



reporting results on a monthly basis as follows: first quarter (January, February), second quarter (March to May), third quarter (June to August) and fourth quarter (September to December). While
this does not affect full year results, it does affect the reporting of quarterly results.

For Hotel Operating Statistics
and Comparable Hotel Results.

In contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations, our hotel operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and our comparable hotel results are
reported based on the reporting cycle used by Marriott for our Marriott-managed hotels. This facilitates year-to-year comparisons, as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year. This means,
however, that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results will typically differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full
year. Set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein. Results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating
statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical financial performance that
are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. These measures are as follows: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P., (ii) Funds From
Operations (FFO) and FFO per diluted share, as a measure of performance for Host Inc., and (iii) comparable hotel operating results, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P. The following discussion defines these terms and
presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.

EBITDA

Earnings before
Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it
helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to
evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process.

Adjusted EBITDA

Historically, management has adjusted EBITDA when evaluating Host Inc. and Host L.P. performance because we believe that the exclusion of
certain additional recurring and non-recurring items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with the primary GAAP
presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor’s complete understanding of our operating performance and is a relevant measure in calculating certain credit ratios. We adjust EBITDA for the following items, which may occur in any
period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA:

•

Real Estate Transactions – We exclude the effect of gains and losses, including the amortization of deferred gains, recorded on the disposition of
assets and property insurance gains in our consolidated statement of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets. In addition, material gains
or losses from the depreciated value of the disposed assets could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets (as noted below for FFO).



•

Equity Investment Adjustments – We exclude the equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated investments in partnerships and joint ventures as
presented in our consolidated statement of operations because it includes our pro rata portion of depreciation, amortization and interest expense. We include our pro rata share of the Adjusted EBITDA of our equity investments as we believe this more
accurately reflects the performance of our investment. The pro rata Adjusted EBITDA of equity investments is defined as the EBITDA of our equity investments adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by our percentage
ownership in the partnership or joint venture.

•

Consolidated Partnership Adjustments – We deduct the non-controlling partners’ pro rata share of the Adjusted EBITDA of our consolidated
partnerships as this reflects the non-controlling owners’ interest in the EBITDA of our consolidated partnerships. The pro rata Adjusted EBITDA of non-controlling partners is defined as the EBITDA of our consolidated partnerships adjusted for
any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by the non-controlling partners’ positions in the partnership or joint venture.

•

Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle – Infrequently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) promulgates new accounting
standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude these one-time adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period.

•

Impairment Losses – We exclude the effect of impairment losses recorded because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA is not
consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets. In addition, we believe that impairment charges are similar to gains (losses) on dispositions and depreciation expense, both of which are also excluded from EBITDA.

•

Acquisition Costs – Effective January 1, 2009, the accounting treatment under GAAP for costs associated with completed property acquisitions
changed and these costs are now expensed in the year incurred as opposed to capitalized as part of the acquisition. Beginning in 2011, we will exclude the effect of these costs because we believe that including them is not reflective of the ongoing
performance of our properties. This is consistent with the EBITDA calculation under the prior GAAP accounting treatment which expensed these costs over time as part of depreciation expense, which is excluded from EBITDA.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies.
This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as
renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately
considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense, capital
expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure
of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.



The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (in millions):

Reconciliation of Net Loss to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA

(a)

Reflects the interest expense, depreciation and amortization and income taxes included in discontinued operations.

(b)

Adjusted EBITDA was significantly affected in 2010 by $10 million of costs incurred related to successful acquisitions. Prior to 2009, the costs were capitalized
as part of the acquisition. These costs are now expensed and deducted from net income and Adjusted EBITDA. For 2009, the accrual for a potential litigation settlement decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $41 million.

FFO and FFO Per Diluted Share.

We present FFO and FFO per diluted share as a non-GAAP measure of Host Inc. performance in
addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate FFO per diluted share for a given operating period as our FFO for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period. NAREIT
defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization and adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities, including the payment of preferred stock dividends, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines.

We believe that FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of Host Inc. operating performance and that
presentation of FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization and gains and losses from
sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe that such a measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods
and between other REITs, even though FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of Host Inc.’s common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real
estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its April 2002 “White Paper on Funds From Operations,” since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have
considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the definition of FFO in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT
operating performance.

We calculate FFO per diluted share, in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not
be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although FFO per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing
our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from



operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) and other items
have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating
decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include depreciation, capital expenditures and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance,
as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, FFO per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash
distributions. In addition, FFO per diluted share does not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to Host Inc.’s stockholders’ benefit.

The following tables provide a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders per share to FFO per diluted share for Host
Inc. (in millions, except per share amounts):

Host Inc. Reconciliation of Net Loss Available to

Common Stockholders to Funds From Operations per Diluted Share

(a)

In accordance with the guidance on FFO per diluted share provided by NAREIT, we do not adjust net income for the non-cash impairment charges when determining our FFO
per diluted share.

(b)

Earnings/loss per diluted share and FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT are adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include
Host Inc. shares granted under Host Inc.’s comprehensive stock plans, preferred OP units held by non-controlling partners, exchangeable debt securities and other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited
partnership interest to common OP units. No effect is shown for securities if they are anti-dilutive.

(c)

During 2009, we repurchased $75 million of the 2004 Debentures with a carrying value of $72 million for $69 million. The adjustments to dilutive FFO related to the 2004
Debentures repurchased during the year include the $3 million gain on repurchase, net of interest expense on the repurchased exchangeable debentures.



(d)

FFO per diluted share and earnings per diluted share were significantly affected by certain transactions, the effects of which are shown in the table below (in
millions, except per share amounts):

(1)

Includes the accrual in the first quarter of 2010 for an additional potential loss related to the 2009 litigation.

(2)

During 2009, we recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $131 million in accordance with GAAP based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying
amount of certain properties.

(3)

For 2010, these costs include those associated with the redemption of the Series K and Series M senior notes. For 2009, the costs include gain/losses associated with
the repayment of exchangeable debentures and the term loan. Additionally, as prescribed by the sharing agreement with the successor borrower in connection with the 2007 defeasance of a $514 million collateralized mortgage-backed security, we
received $7 million for year ended December 31, 2009 and recorded the gain as a reduction of interest expense.

(4)

Represents the original issuance costs of the Class E preferred stock, which were redeemed on June 18, 2010.

(5)

Represents costs incurred related to acquisitions and investments during 2010. Previously, these costs would have been capitalized as part of the acquisition; however,
under accounting requirements effective January 1, 2009 these costs are expensed and deducted from net income and FFO.

(6)

Represents the portion of the significant items attributable to non-controlling partners of Host L.P.

Comparable Hotel Operating Results.

We present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses,
and adjusted operating profit, on a comparable hotel, or “same store” basis as supplemental information for investors of both Host Inc. and Host L.P. We present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate-level costs
and expenses related to our capital structure, as well as depreciation and amortization. We eliminate corporate-level costs and expenses because we believe property-level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing
operating performance of our hotels. We eliminate depreciation and amortization, because even though depreciation and amortization are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate
assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered
presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.

As a result of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses or
operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are
material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management
with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether
increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors, such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions. While
management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a “same store” supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the
operating performance of these hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results. For these reasons, we believe that comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the
presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.



The following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable
hotels for the periods presented herein:

Comparable Hotel Results for Host Inc. and Host L.P.

(in millions, except hotel statistics)

(a)

The reconciliation of total revenues per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable hotel revenues is as follows:

(b)

The reconciliation of operating costs per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable hotel expenses is as follows:



(c)

Non-comparable hotel results, net, includes the following items: (i) the results of operations of our non-comparable hotels whose operations are included in our
consolidated statements of operations as continuing operations and (ii) the difference between the number of days of operations reflected in the comparable hotel results and the number of days of operations reflected in the consolidated
statements of operations.

(d)

Represents income less expense for hotels leased from HPT and office buildings.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk

All information in this section applies to Host Inc. and Host L.P.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market
risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We have no derivative financial instruments held for trading purposes. We use derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks.

Our interest payments on 90% of our debt are fixed in nature (this percentage does not include $300 million of mortgage
debt for which we have swapped fixed interest payments for floating interest payments), which largely mitigates the effect of changes in interest rates on our cash interest payments. Valuations for mortgage debt and the credit facility are
determined based on the expected future payments, discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The senior notes and the Debentures are valued based on quoted market prices. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by 100
basis points, interest expense would increase or decrease, respectively, our future earnings and cash flows by approximately $5 million in 2011.

The table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

(1)

The amounts are net of unamortized discounts and premiums.

(2)

The interest rate for our floating rate payments is based on the rate in effect as of December 31, 2010. No adjustments are made for forecasted changes in the
rate.

Fair Value Interest Rate Swap Derivatives.

We currently have three interest rate swap
agreements for an aggregate notional amount of $300 million related to The Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa mortgage loan in the amount of $300 million. We entered into the derivative instruments to
hedge changes in the fair value of the fixed-rate mortgage that occur as a result of changes in the 3-month LIBOR rate. As a result, we will pay a floating interest rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR, plus a spread which ranges from 2.7% to 3.2%, as
opposed to the fixed rate of 5.531%, on the notional amount of $300 million through March 1, 2014. During 2010 and 2009, the cash settlement received under the swap agreement decreased interest expense by $6 million and
$1 million, respectively.



We have designated these derivatives as fair value hedges. The derivatives are valued based
on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement. If we were to increase the interest rates from the prevailing market yield curve, which for our reverse swaps is 3-month LIBOR, by 25% at December 31, 2010, then the fair value of
the swap would decrease $3 million. Similarly, if we were to decrease the interest rates from the prevailing market yield curve by 25% at December 31, 2010, then the fair value of the swap would increase by $3 million. We also
evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps. As of December 31, 2010, we recorded an asset of $10.6 million related to the fair value of the swaps. The change in the fair value of the derivative is
largely offset by the corresponding change in the fair value of the underlying debt due to change in the 3-month LIBOR rate, which is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt. Any difference between the change in the fair value
of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt, which was not significant for the periods presented, is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship and is recorded in net income/loss.

Exchange Rate Sensitivity

As we have non-U.S. operations (specifically, the ownership of hotels in Canada, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, the United Kingdom and New Zealand
and an investment in our European joint venture), currency exchange risk arises as a normal part of our business. To manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non-U.S. hotels, where possible, we may enter into forward or option
contracts. The foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes.

During 2010 and 2008, we entered into four foreign currency forward purchase contracts totaling €80 million (approximately $114 million) to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure
resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the European joint venture. Pursuant to these transactions, we will sell the Euro amount, and receive the U.S. Dollar amount on the forward purchase date. These derivatives are
considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation and are marked-to-market with changes in fair value and recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within Host Inc.’s equity portion and Host
L.P.’s capital portion of their balance sheets. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps. The following table summarizes our four foreign currency purchase contracts (in millions):

Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. & Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.:

We have audited Host Hotels &
Resorts, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO)

.

Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in Item 9a

Controls and Procedures—Internal Control over Financial Reporting

of Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, and our report dated February 24, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

Basis of Presentation and Principles of
Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Host Inc., Host L.P.
and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, including joint ventures and partnerships. We consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity. For
those partnerships and joint ventures where we are the general partner, we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would preclude the assumption of control as the general partner. Limited partner rights which would
preclude presumption of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause and substantive participating rights, primarily through
voting rights.

We also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they should be considered variable interest entities
(“VIEs). If a subsidiary is a VIE, it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for VIEs. Based on these guidelines, typically the entity that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic
performance would consolidate the VIE. We consider an entity a VIE if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for
the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. In accordance with ASC 810, we reviewed our subsidiaries to determine if (i) any of our subsidiaries or affiliates should be considered VIEs, and
(ii) whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in the characteristics of these entities.

Use of
Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash includes reserves for debt service, real estate taxes, insurance, furniture, fixtures and equipment, as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits due to mortgage debt agreement
restrictions and provisions, as well as a required reserve for potential legal damages. For purposes of the statements of cash flows, changes in restricted cash caused by changes in required legal reserves are shown as operating activities. Changes
in restricted cash caused by using such funds for furniture, fixture and equipment replacement are shown as investing activities. The remaining changes in restricted cash are the direct result of restrictions under our loan agreements, and, as such,
are reflected in cash from financing activities.

Property and Equipment

Generally, property and equipment is recorded at cost. For newly developed properties, cost includes interest and real estate taxes
incurred during development and construction. For property and equipment acquired in a business combination, we record the assets based on their fair value as of the acquisition date. Replacements and improvements and capital leases are capitalized,
while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. We depreciate our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 40 years for buildings and three to ten years for furniture and
equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets.

We capitalize certain inventory (such as china, glass, silver, linen) at the time of a hotel opening or acquisition, or when significant
inventory is purchased (in conjunction with a major rooms renovation or when the number of rooms or meeting space at a hotel is expanded). These amounts are then amortized over the estimated useful life of three years. Subsequent replacement
purchases are expensed when placed in service.

We maintain a furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement fund for renewal
and replacement capital expenditures at certain hotels, which is generally funded with approximately 5% of property revenues.

We analyze our assets for impairment when events or circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We
consider a property to be impaired when the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset. We test for impairment in several situations, including when a property
has a current or projected loss from operations, when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when other events, trends, contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate
that a triggering event has occurred and an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. For impaired assets, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the property’s carrying value over its fair value. In the evaluation of
the impairment of our assets, we make many assumptions and estimates, including assumptions on the projected cash flows, both from operations and the eventual disposition, the expected useful life and holding period of the asset, the future required
capital expenditures and fair values, including consideration of capitalization rates, discount rates and comparable selling prices.

We will classify a hotel as held for sale when the sale of the asset is probable, will be completed within one year and actions to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the sale will be
withdrawn. Accordingly, we typically classify assets as held for sale when Host Inc.’s Board of Directors has approved the sale, a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant
amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner. If these criteria are met, we will cease recording depreciation and will record an impairment
loss if the fair value less costs to sell is lower than the carrying amount of the hotel. We will classify the loss, together with the related operating results, including interest expense on debt assumed by the buyer or that is required to be
repaid as a result of the sale, as discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of operations and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet. Gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of
sale or deferred and recognized as income in subsequent periods as conditions requiring deferral are satisfied or expire without further cost to us.

We recognize the fair value of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations, including environmental remediation liabilities, when incurred, which is generally upon acquisition,
construction, or development and/or through the normal operation of the asset, if sufficient information exists with which to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Intangible Assets

In conjunction with our acquisition of hotel properties, we may identify intangible assets. Identifiable intangible assets are typically contracts, including ground and retail leases and management and
franchise agreements, which are recorded at fair value, although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms. These contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid
pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the contract. Intangible assets are amortized using the
straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable term of the related agreements.

Non-Controlling Interests

Other Consolidated Partnerships.

As of December 31, 2010, we consolidate four majority-owned partnerships that have
third-party, non-controlling ownership interests. The third-party partnership interests are included in non-controlling interest-other consolidated partnerships on the consolidated balance sheets and totaled $29 million and $22 million as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Three of the partnerships have finite lives ranging from 99 to 100 years that terminate between 2081 and 2095, and the associated non-controlling interests are mandatorily redeemable at the end of the
finite life. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair values of the non-controlling interests in the partnerships with finite lives were approximately $65 million and $44 million, respectively.

Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests of consolidated partnerships is included in our determination of net income
(loss). However, net income (loss) has been reduced by the amount attributable to non-controlling interests of third parties, which totaled $(0.4) million, $1 million and $(3) million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
and 2008, respectively, in the determination of net income (loss) attributable to Host Inc. and Host L.P.

Host
Inc.’s treatment of the non-controlling interests of Host L.P.:

Host Inc. adjusts the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. each period so that the amount presented equals the greater of its carrying value based on the accumulated
historical cost or its redemption value. The historical cost is based on the proportional relationship between the historical cost of equity held by our common stockholders relative to that of the unitholders of Host L.P. The redemption value is
based on the amount of cash or Host Inc. stock, at our option, that would be paid to the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. if it were terminated. Therefore, we have assumed that the redemption value is equivalent to the number of shares
issuable upon conversion of the outside OP units valued at the market price of Host Inc. common stock at the balance sheet date. Subsequent to the stock dividend issued in 2009 (see Note 5 – “Stockholders’ Equity of Host Inc. and
Partners’ Capital of Host L.P.”), one OP unit may now be exchanged into 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock. Non-controlling interests of Host L.P. are classified in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet as they do not meet the
requirements for equity classification because the redemption feature requires the delivery of registered shares. The table below details the historical cost and redemption values for the non-controlling interests (in millions):

(1)

The book value recorded is equal to the greater of the redemption value or the historical cost.

Net income (loss) is allocated to the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. based on their weighted average ownership percentage during
the period. Net income (loss) attributable to Host Inc. has been reduced by the amount attributable to non-controlling interests in Host L.P., which totaled $2 million, $5 million and $(16) million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

Distributions from Investments in Affiliates

We classify the distributions from our equity investments in the statements of cash flows based upon an evaluation of the specific facts
and circumstances of each distribution in order to determine its nature. For example, distributions from cash generated by property operations are classified as cash flows from operating activities. However, distributions received as a result of
property sales would be classified as cash flows from investing activities.

Other-than-Temporary Impairments

We review our equity method investments for other-than-temporary impairment based on the occurrence of any triggering events that would
indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an other-than-temporary basis. Triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment, a change in the expected useful life or other
significant events which would decrease the value of the investment. Our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties; therefore, we will generally have few observable inputs and will determine the fair value based on a
discounted cash flow analysis of the investment, as well as considering the impact of other elements (i.e. control premiums, etc.). We use certain inputs such as available third-party appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel
properties in order to estimate the expected cash flows. If an equity method investment is impaired, a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment.

Income Taxes

Host Inc.
has elected to be treated as a REIT under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and, as such, is not subject to federal income tax, provided that it distributes all of its taxable income annually to its stockholders and complies with certain
other requirements. In addition to paying federal and state income tax on any retained income, one of our subsidiary REITs is subject to a tax on “built-in-gains” on sales of certain assets. As a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, Host L.P. is not subject to federal income tax. Host L.P. is however, subject to state, local and foreign income and franchise tax in certain jurisdictions. In addition, each of the Host L.P. taxable REIT subsidiaries is taxable as a
regular C corporation and is subject to federal, state and foreign income tax. The consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of the taxable REIT subsidiaries, state income and
franchise taxes incurred by Host Inc. and Host L.P. and foreign income taxes incurred by Host L.P. as well as each of their respective subsidiaries.

Under the partnership agreement, Host L.P. is generally required to reimburse Host Inc. for any tax payments it is required to make. Accordingly, the tax information included herein represents disclosures
regarding Host Inc. and its subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on
consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies.

Deferred Charges

Financing costs related to long-term debt are deferred
and amortized over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method.

Foreign Currency Translation

As of December 31, 2010, our foreign operations consist of one property located in Brazil, two properties located in Chile, four
properties located in Canada, one property located in Mexico, and one property located in the United Kingdom, as well as an investment in a joint venture in Europe and an investment in a joint venture in Asia. The operations of these properties and
our investments are maintained in their functional currency, which is

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

generally the local currency, and are translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for the period. The assets and liabilities of the properties and the investments are translated
to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency for each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at period end exchange rates. The resulting exchange differences on translation are recorded in gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions and derivatives on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, except
when deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income as qualifying net investment hedges.

Derivative Instruments

We are subject to market exposures in several aspects of our business and may, from time to time, enter into derivative instruments in
order to hedge the effect of these market exposures on our operations. Potential market exposures for which we may use derivative instruments to hedge include: (i) changes in the fair value of our international investments due to fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates, (ii) changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt due to changes in the underlying interest rates, and (iii) variability in interest cash flows due to changes in the underlying interest rate for our
floating-rate debt. Prior to entering into the derivative contract, we evaluate whether the transaction will qualify for hedge accounting and continue to evaluate hedge effectiveness through the life of the contract. Derivative contracts that meet
the requirements for hedge accounting are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with offsetting changes recorded to net income (loss) or accumulated other comprehensive income, based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance. We incorporate
credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect
of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.

Accounting for Share-Based Payments

At December 31, 2010, Host Inc.
maintained two stock-based employee compensation plans. Additionally, in connection with Host Inc.’s conversion to a REIT, Host L.P. assumed the employee obligations of Host Inc. Therefore, upon the issuance of Host’s common stock under
the compensation plans, Host L.P. will issue to Host Inc. common OP units of an equivalent value. Accordingly, these liabilities and related disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements for Host Inc. and Host L.P., respectively.
See Note 8 – “Employee Stock Plans.”

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions, access to our credit facility, and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts. At December 31, 2010, our exposure risk related to
our derivative contracts totaled $18 million and the counterparties are investment grade financial institutions. Our credit risk exposure with regard to our cash and the $542 million available under our credit facility is spread among a
diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.

Business Combinations

We recognize identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, non-controlling interests and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination at their fair values at the acquisition date based on
the exit price (i.e. the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date). Furthermore, acquisition-related costs, such as due diligence, legal and
accounting fees, are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets. Classification of a lease does not change if it is part of a business combination. Capital lease obligations that are assumed as a part of the
acquisition of a leasehold interest are fair valued and included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we will record the corresponding right-to-use assets. In certain situations, a deferred tax liability is created due to the difference
between the fair value and the tax basis of the asset at the acquisition date, which also may result in a goodwill asset being recorded. The goodwill that is recorded as a result of this difference is not subject to amortization.

European Joint Venture

We are a partner in HHR Euro CV, a joint venture that owns 11 hotels in Europe (the “European joint venture”). We serve as the general partner and have a 32.1% ownership interest therein
(including our limited and general partner interests). The initial term of the European joint venture is ten years, subject to two one-year extensions with partner approval. During 2010, the partners of the European joint venture amended and
restated their partnership agreement. The amendments were (i) to extend the commitment period during which the European joint venture may make additional equity investments from May 2010 to May 2013, (ii) to reflect an internal
restructuring of one of our joint venture partners, and (iii) to reflect changes as a result of the acquisition of the equity interests of subsidiaries previously owned by a separate TRS joint venture with the same partners, which subsidiaries
currently lease, as tenant, five of the hotels owned by the European joint venture. After the partnership agreement was amended, the separate TRS joint venture was dissolved. Due to the ownership structure and the non-Host limited partners’
unilateral rights to cause the dissolution and liquidation of the European joint venture at any time, it is not consolidated in our financial statements. As general partner, we earn a management fee based on the amount of equity commitments and
equity investments. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded approximately $5 million, $6 million and $6 million of management fees, respectively.

During 2010, the European joint venture completed an agreement with the lender holding mortgages totaling €70.5 million on three hotels located in Brussels, under which the lender waived
breaches of any financial covenants. Additionally, during 2010, the European joint venture negotiated an agreement with the lenders of mortgage loans totaling €342 million due in 2013 that had breached financial covenants. The lenders have
agreed to amend these financial covenants for two years in exchange for a deposit of approximately €10 million in an escrow to fund debt service or capital expenditures and commitments to fund planned incremental capital expenditures.
These loans are secured by six hotels located in Spain, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom. These mortgage loans are non-recourse to us and a default under these loans does not trigger a default under any of our debt.

During 2010, we entered into a €20 million ($26 million) foreign currency forward purchase contract. We will sell the Euro
amount and receive the U.S. dollar amount on the forward purchase date of October 1, 2014. We have entered into four foreign currency forward purchase contracts totaling €80 million (approximately $114 million) to hedge a portion
of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the European joint venture. These derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, and,
in accordance with GAAP, are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the stockholders’ equity portion of our balance sheet. See Note 13 – “Fair Value Measurements” for
further discussion of our derivatives and hedging instruments.

Our unconsolidated investees assess impairment of real estate
properties based on whether estimated undiscounted future cash flows from each individual property are less than book value. If a property is impaired, a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and net book value of the hotel. We
also review our investments for other-than-temporary impairment based on the occurrence of any events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an other-than-temporary basis. During 2009, we recorded a
non-cash impairment charge totaling $34 million in equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates based on the difference between the estimated fair value of our investment and its carrying value. See Note 13 – “Fair Value

Senior Notes

General.

Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, which includes our Exchangeable Senior Debentures, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of our
unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all of our subordinated obligations. The face amount of our senior notes as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $4.4 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. The senior notes balance as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009 includes discounts of approximately $109 million and $145 million, respectively. The notes under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are secured by pledges
of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes under our senior notes indenture, as well as our credit facility, certain other senior debt, and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging
agreements, if any, with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. We pay interest on each series of our senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above.

Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the
satisfaction of various conditions. As of December 31, 2010, we are in compliance with all of these covenants.

We
completed the following senior notes transactions during 2010 and 2009:

validly tendered pursuant to the put option. Therefore, the $325 million aggregate principal amount of the 2004 Debentures remains outstanding. We currently may redeem for cash all, or a portion, of the 2004 Debentures upon a 30 day notice to the
holders. If, at any time, we elect to redeem the 2004 Debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we would expect the holders to elect to redeem the 2004 Debentures for Host Inc. stock rather than for cash equal to the
redemption price. The next put option date for holders of the 2004 Debentures is April 15, 2014;

•

on January 20, 2010, we redeemed the remaining $346 million outstanding of our 7% Series M senior notes that were due in August 2012. As a
result of the repurchase, we recorded an $8 million loss on debt extinguishments, which is included in interest expense;

•

on December 22, 2009, we issued $400 million of

% Exchangeable Senior Debentures and received
proceeds of $391 million, net of underwriting fees and expenses (the “2009 Debentures”). The proceeds, along with available cash, were used to redeem the remaining $346 million of the 7% Series M senior notes (described above)
and to repay the $124 million mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis in the first quarter of 2010. We separately account for the debt and equity portion of the debentures to reflect the fair value of the liability component based on our
non-convertible borrowing cost at the issuance date. Accordingly, we recorded the liability component of the debentures at a fair value of $316 million, which is based on an effective interest rate of 6.9% on December 16, 2009. We will
amortize the resulting discount over the expected life of the debentures. See “Exchangeable Debentures” below;

•

during 2009, we repurchased approximately $74 million face amount of the 2


/


% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (the “2007 Debentures”),
with a carrying value of $68 million, for $66 million and recorded a gain of approximately $2 million on the transactions. We have $526 million face amount of the 2007 Debentures outstanding;

•

on May 11, 2009, Host L.P. issued $400 million of 9% Series T senior notes maturing May 15, 2017 and received proceeds of approximately
$380 million, net of discounts and underwriting fees and expenses. Interest on the Series T notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15, beginning July 15, 2009. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay
the $200 million outstanding on the revolver portion of our credit facility and the outstanding $135 million mortgage debt on the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa; and

•

in the first quarter of 2009, we repurchased $75 million face amount of the 2004 Debentures, with a carrying value of $72 million, for
approximately $69 million and recorded a gain on the repurchase of approximately $3 million. We have $325 million face amount of the 2004 Debentures outstanding.

The gains on the repurchased debentures are recorded in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements. We evaluated the fair
value of the debt repurchased based on the fair value of the cash flows at the date of the repurchase discounted at risk adjusted rates. Based on this calculation, the fair value of the debt repurchased was generally greater than the conversion
price; therefore, substantially all of the repurchase price was allocated to the debt portion of the debentures.

Exchangeable Debentures

As of December 31, 2010, we have three issuances of exchangeable senior debentures outstanding:
$400 million of 2

were issued on March 23, 2007 and $325 million of 3


/


% debentures that were issued on March 16, 2004, collectively, the “Debentures.” The Debentures are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes.
Holders have the right to require us to purchase the Debentures at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest (the “put option”) on certain dates subsequent to their respective issuances. Holders of the
Debentures also have the right to exchange the Debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions, including at any time at which the closing price of Host Inc.’s common stock is more than 120% (for the 2004 Debentures) or 130% (for the 2007
and 2009 Debentures) of the exchange price per share for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days prior to the date on which the Debentures have been called for redemption. We can redeem for cash
all, or a portion, of any of the Debentures at any time subsequent to each of their respective redemption dates at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. If, at any time, we elect to redeem the Debentures and the
exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we would expect the holders to elect to exchange the Debentures at the respective exchange value rather than receive the cash redemption price. The exchange value is equal to the applicable exchange
rate multiplied by the price of Host Inc.’s common stock. Upon exchange, the 2004 Debentures would be exchanged for Host Inc.’s common stock, the 2007 Debentures would be exchanged for a combination of cash (for the principal balance of
the debentures) and Host Inc.’s common stock (for the remainder of the exchange value) and the 2009 Debentures would be exchanged for Host Inc.’s common stock, cash or a combination thereof, at our option. Based on Host Inc.’s stock
price at December 31, 2010, the 2004 Debentures’ and 2009 Debentures’ if-converted value would exceed the outstanding principal amount by $54 million and $108 million, respectively. Currently, none of the Debentures are
exchangeable by holders.

The following chart details our outstanding Debentures as of December 31, 2010:

We separately account for the liability and equity components of our Debentures to reflect the
fair value of the liability component based on our non-convertible borrowing cost at the issuance date. Accordingly, for the Debentures, we record the liability components thereof at fair value as of the date of issuance and amortize the resulting
discount as an increase to interest expense over the expected life of the debt; however, there is no effect on our cash interest payments. We measured the fair value of the debt components of the 2009 Debentures, 2007 Debentures and 2004 Debentures
at issuance based on effective interest rates of 6.9%, 6.5% and 6.8%, respectively. As a result, we attributed $247 million of the proceeds received to the conversion feature of the Debentures. This amount represents the excess proceeds
received over the fair value of the debt at the date of issuance and is included in Host Inc.’s additional paid-in capital and Host L.P.’s capital on the consolidated balance sheets. The following chart details the initial allocations
between the debt and equity components of the Debentures, net of the original issue discount, based on the effective interest rate at the time of issuance, as well as the debt balances at December 31, 2010:

Authorization for Senior Notes and Exchangeable Senior Debentures Repurchase

In February 2010, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of senior notes, exchangeable
senior debentures, mortgage debt and preferred stock. Host Inc. may purchase senior notes and exchangeable debentures through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or, in some cases, through the early redemption of
such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would
affect earnings as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs.

In February 2011, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized repurchases up to $500 million of senior notes, exchangeable debentures and mortgage debt (other than in accordance with its terms)
and terminated the previous authorization. Separately, the Board of Directors authorized redemptions and repurchases of all or a portion of $325 million principal amount of our 2004 Debentures. Any redemption of the 2004 Debentures will not
reduce the $500 million of Board authority noted above to repurchase other debt securities.

Credit Facility

On May 25, 2007, we entered into a second amended and restated bank credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG New York
Branch, as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Citicorp North America Inc., Société Générale and Calyon New York Branch, as Co-Documentation Agents and certain other agents and lenders. The
credit facility provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of $600 million. During any period in which our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate
outstanding principal amount under the credit facility to exceed $300 million. The credit facility also includes subcommitments for (i) the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of $10 million, and (ii) loans in
certain foreign currencies in an aggregate amount of $300 million, (A) $150 million of which may be loaned to certain of our Canadian subsidiaries in Canadian Dollars, and (B) $300 million of which may be loaned to us in
Pounds Sterling and Euros. The credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of September 2011. We have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met as of September 2011. These conditions include the
payment of a fee to the lenders, no default or event of default exists and the maintenance of a leverage ratio below 6.75x. Subject to certain conditions, we also have the option to increase the amount of the facility by up to $190 million to
the extent that any one or more lenders, whether or not currently party to the credit facility, commits to be a lender for such amount.

On July 20, 2010, we drew £37 million ($56 million) from our credit facility in order to fund the cash portion of the acquisition of Le Méridien Piccadilly in London. Based on our
leverage at December 31, 2010, we have $542 million of remaining available capacity under our credit facility.

Collateral and Guarantees.

The obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries
and are currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The pledges are permitted to be released in the event that certain conditions are satisfied, including the requirement that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for
two consecutive fiscal quarters. As a result of having satisfied such conditions, currently we are not required to pledge our equity interests in any newly acquired or formed subsidiary, and at our election, we may obtain a release of all existing
pledges for so long as our leverage ratio continues to be below 6.0x. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility, as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture and interest rate swap agreements and other
hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility.



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Prepayments.

The loans under the credit facility are required to be
prepaid, subject to certain exceptions, with excess proceeds from certain asset sales. Voluntary prepayments of the loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty.

Financial Covenants.

The credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and
unsecured interest coverage. The financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility. As of December 31, 2010, we are in compliance with the covenants under our credit facility.

Interest and Fees.

We pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates plus
a margin that is set with reference to our leverage ratio. In the case of LIBOR-based borrowings in U.S. Dollars, as well as Euros and Pounds Sterling denominated borrowings, the rate of interest ranges from 65 basis points to 150 basis points over
LIBOR. We also have the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points and the Prime Lending Rate, plus, in both cases, the applicable spread ranging from 0 to 50 basis points. Based on our
leverage ratio at December 31, 2010 of 5.0x, we can borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 90 basis points or Prime plus 0 basis points. To the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused
portion of the loan commitment of 10 to 15 basis points, depending on our average revolver usage during the applicable period.

Mortgage
Debt

All of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets, except for environmental liabilities, fraud,
misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2010, we have 11 assets that are secured by mortgage debt, with an average interest rate of 4.7% that mature between 2011 and 2023. As of December 31,
2010, we are in compliance with the covenants under all of our mortgage debt obligations.

We had the following mortgage debt
issuances and repayments since January 2009. Interest for our mortgage debt is payable on a monthly basis:

(1)

The amount shown reflects our recorded book value of the mortgage debt on the date of acquisition and defeasance, respectively. The face principal of the mortgage debt
assumed was $115 million. We defeased this loan on October 19, 2010, which released us from obligations under the mortgage.

(2)

This floating mortgage is based on LIBOR plus 118 basis points. The rate shown reflects the rate in effect at December 31, 2010. We have the right to extend the
maturity for a one year period subject to certain conditions.

(3)

The JW Marriott, Washington, D.C. mortgage debt has a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 600 basis points, with a LIBOR floor of 1.5%. The interest rate shown
reflects the rate in effect at December 31, 2010. Additionally, we have the right to extend the maturity for an additional one-year period, subject to certain conditions. In addition, as required by the loan agreement, we entered into an
interest rate cap agreement which caps the LIBOR rate at 3% through the life of the loan.

(4)

On December 17, 2010, we entered into an amendment under the $300 million mortgage loan secured by the Orlando World Center Marriott. As a result of the amendment,
we repaid $54 million of the outstanding principal on December 30, 2010 and extended the maturity of the loan to July 1, 2013. We implemented a fixed annual interest rate of 4.75% on the remaining $246 million outstanding.

derivatives have been entered into for trading purposes. See Note 13 – “Fair Value Measurements.”

Aggregate Debt Maturities

Aggregate debt maturities at December 31, 2010 are as follows (in millions):

(1)

The debt maturing in 2011 includes $58 million outstanding on our credit facility, for which we have the option to extend the maturity for an additional year, subject
to the satisfaction of certain financial covenants.

(2)

In January 2011, we extended the maturity of the $50 million Le Méridien Piccadilly mortgage to January 20, 2012 and, therefore, have included it in
the 2012 maturities. The mortgage loan can be extended for an additional one-year period, subject to the satisfaction of certain financial covenants.

Interest

The following are included in interest expense for the years
ended December 31, (in millions):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Capital of Host L.P.

As of December 31, 2010, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately 98.4% of Host L.P.’s common OP units. The remaining 1.6% of common OP units are held by various third party limited partners.
Each OP unit may be redeemed for cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock, based on the conversion ratio of 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Host L.P. has 671.8 million and 644.4 million common OP units outstanding, respectively,
of which Host Inc. held 661.4 million and 632.7 million, respectively. In addition, no preferred OP units were outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and 4.0 million were outstanding at December 31, 2009.

In exchange for any shares issued by Host Inc., Host L.P. will issue OP units based on the applicable conversion ratio. Additionally,
funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends on its common stock are provided through distributions from Host L.P.

Issuances of Common Stock

On August 19, 2010, Host Inc. entered into a Sales Agency Financing Agreement with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC,
through which Host Inc. may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $400 million. The sales will be made in “at the market” offerings under Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) rules, including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange. BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC is acting as sales agent. Host Inc. issued approximately 18.8 million shares of common stock through this new program at an
average price of $15.96 per share for net proceeds of $297 million. Host Inc. may continue to sell shares of common stock under its new program from time to time based on market conditions, although they are not under an obligation to sell any
shares. Host Inc. has approximately $100 million remaining under the program.

On August 19, 2009, Host Inc. entered
into a Sales Agency Financing Agreement with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, through which Host Inc. may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $400 million. During 2010 and 2009,
Host Inc. issued approximately 8 million and 28 million shares, respectively of common stock through this program at an average price of approximately $13.58 per share and $10.37 per share, respectively, for net proceeds of approximately
$109 million and $287 million, respectively.

On April 29, 2009, Host Inc. issued 75.75 million of common stock
at $6.60 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $480 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and transaction expenses.

Dividends/Distributions

Host Inc. is required to distribute at least 90%
of its annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its stockholders in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash.
Funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends on its common stock are provided through distributions from Host L.P. Host Inc.’s policy in 2010 was to pay a dividend of $.01 per quarter with respect to its common stock, without regard to the
existence of taxable income. The amount of any future dividends will be determined by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors.

On
September 14, 2009, Host Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a special dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock of Host Inc., which was paid on December 18, 2009 to holders of record as of November 6, 2009. The
dividend was paid with cash or with shares of common stock, at the election of the stockholder. In order to comply with Host Inc.’s remaining REIT taxable income distribution requirements for the year ended December 31, 2009, Host
Inc.’s Board of Directors determined that the cash component of the dividend (other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) would not exceed 10% in the aggregate. As a result, Host Inc. issued 13.4 million shares of Host Inc. common
stock valued at $140 million on December 18, 2009, and paid cash in the amount of approximately $16 million, for a total dividend of $156 million. Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of
Host L.P., as amended (the “Partnership Agreement”), common



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OP unitholders received the cash distribution of 10% of the $0.25 per share dividend paid by Host Inc. to its common stockholders, or $0.025 per OP unit, but did not receive an equivalent per
unit distribution for the 90% of the dividend paid with Host Inc. common stock. Therefore, subsequent to the issuance of shares of common stock to stockholders of Host Inc., the conversion factor used to convert OP units into shares of Host Inc.
common stock was adjusted from 1.0 to 1.021494.

All common and preferred cash and stock dividends that were taxable to our
stockholders in 2010 and 2009 were considered 100% ordinary income. None of such dividends were considered qualified dividends subject to a reduced tax rate. The table below presents the amount of common and preferred dividends declared per share
and common and preferred distributions per unit as follows:

Preferred Stock Redemption

On June 18, 2010, Host Inc. redeemed 4,034,300 shares of its 8


/


% Class E cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a redemption
price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued dividends. The original issuance costs for the Class E preferred stock are treated as a deemed dividend in Host Inc.’s consolidated statement of operations and have been reflected as a deduction to net
income available to common stockholders for the purpose of calculating Host Inc.’s basic and diluted earnings per share. Similarly, the issuance costs have been treated as a deemed distribution in Host L.P.’s consolidated statement of
operations and have been reflected as a reduction to Host L.P.’s earnings per diluted unit. As a result of the redemption, no classes of preferred stock are outstanding.

6. Income Taxes

Host Inc. elected to be taxed as a REIT effective January 1, 1999, pursuant to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In general, a corporation that elects REIT status and meets certain
tax law requirements regarding the distribution of its taxable income to its stockholders as prescribed by applicable tax laws and complies with certain other requirements (relating primarily to the composition of its assets and the sources of its
revenues) is generally not subject to federal and state income taxation on its operating income that is distributed to its stockholders. As a partnership for federal income tax purposes, Host L.P. is not subject to federal income tax. It is,
however, subject to state, local and foreign income and franchise tax in certain jurisdictions. In addition to paying federal and state income taxes on any retained income, one of our subsidiary REITs is subject to taxes on
“built-in-gains” that result from sales of certain assets. Additionally, each of our taxable REIT subsidiaries is taxable as a regular C corporation, subject to federal, state and foreign income tax. The consolidated income tax provision
or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of the taxable REIT subsidiaries, state income taxes incurred by Host Inc. and Host L.P. and foreign income taxes incurred by Host L.P., as well as each of their
respective subsidiaries.

Where required, deferred income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under
this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryovers based on
enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available
evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies.



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Total deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as
follows (in millions):

We have recorded a 100% valuation allowance of approximately $38 million against the net deferred tax
asset related to the net operating loss and asset tax credit carryovers as of December 31, 2010 with respect to our hotel in Mexico. There is a $1 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss
and capital loss carryovers as of December 31, 2010 with respect to our hotels in Canada. Finally, there is a $5 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss carryovers as of December 31,
2010 with respect to certain of our U.S. taxable REIT subsidiaries that act as lessee pursuant to the HPT leases. We expect that the remaining net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carryovers for U.S. federal income tax purposes to
be realized. The net increase in the valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 was approximately $7 million and $9 million, respectively. The primary components of our net deferred tax asset
were as follows (in millions):

At December 31, 2010, we have aggregate gross domestic and foreign net operating loss, capital loss and
tax credit carryovers of approximately $200 million. We have deferred tax assets related to these loss and tax credit carryovers of approximately $71 million, with a valuation allowance of approximately $44 million. Our net operating
loss carryovers expire through 2030, and our foreign capital loss carryovers have no expiration period. Our domestic alternative minimum tax credits have no expiration period and our foreign asset tax credits expire through 2017.

The (benefit) provision for income taxes for continuing operations consists of (in
millions):

The total benefit for income taxes, including the amounts associated with discontinued operations, was
($32) million, ($40) million and ($3) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The differences between
the income tax (benefit) provision calculated at the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% and the actual income tax (benefit) provision recorded each year for continuing operations are as follows (in millions):

Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, was $4 million, $5 million and
$7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

GAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return. We must determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related
appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater
than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement in order to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. This accounting standard applies to all tax positions related to income taxes. A reconciliation of the beginning
and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

All of such amount, if recognized, would impact our reconciliation between the income tax provision
(benefit) calculated at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% and the actual income tax provision (benefit) recorded each year. In 2009, we recognized an income tax benefit of $7 million, related to the reduction of previously accrued
income taxes after an evaluation of the exposure items and the expiration of the related statutes of limitation. No such amount was recognized in 2010.



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will not
change within 12 months of the reporting date. As of December 31, 2010, the tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions generally include 2007-2010.

We recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. During each
of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized approximately $0.1 million of interest expense related to the unrecognized tax benefits. We had approximately $0.6 million and $0.5 million of interest accrued at
December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

7. Leases

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries Leases

We lease substantially all of our hotels to a wholly owned subsidiary that qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary due to federal income tax restrictions on a REIT’s ability to derive revenue directly
from the operation and management of a hotel.

Hospitality Properties Trust Relationship

We own a leasehold interest in 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties, which properties were sold to Hospitality Properties Trust
(“HPT”) and leased back to us in 1995 and 1996. In conjunction with our conversion to a REIT, we entered into subleases for these 53 properties, as well as 18 Residence Inn by Marriott properties, with a third party. In late June 2010, HPT
sent notices of default because the subtenants failed to meet net worth covenants, which would have triggered an event of default by us under the leases between us and HPT. As a result, we terminated the subleases effective July 6, 2010 and we
resumed acting as owner under the management agreements. Effective upon termination of the subleases, we recorded the operations of the hotels as opposed to rental income for the remaining portion of 2010. As a result, we recorded $123 million
of hotel revenues for the 71 properties, as well as $44 million of rental income earned prior to the termination of the subleases in 2010, which are included in other revenues on the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, we
recorded $96 million of hotel expenses related to the 71 properties, as well as $84 million of rental expense due to HPT in 2010, which are included in other property-level expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The
property revenues and rental income recorded, less the hotel expenses and rental expenses, resulted in a loss of approximately $13 million and $1 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and a gain of $4 million in 2008.

The subtenants remain obligated to us for outstanding rent payment obligations to the extent that operating cash generated by the hotels
is less than rent that would have been paid under the terminated subleases, although they have not funded the obligation since the termination of the subleases. At the expiration of that master lease, HPT is obligated to pay us deferred proceeds
related to the initial sale of the 53 Courtyard properties of approximately $51 million, subject to damages arising out of an event of default, if any, under the master lease, plus additional amounts held in a tenant collection account. We
terminated the master lease on the 18 Residence Inn properties in accordance with its terms effective December 31, 2010, at which time HPT paid us $17.2 million of deferred proceeds related to the initial sale of the 18 Residence Inn
properties and additional amounts held in the tenants collection account. On November 23, 2010, we gave notice that we will not extend the term of the master lease on the 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties, which will result in termination and
expiration of the lease on those properties effective December 31, 2012.

Ground Leases

As of December 31, 2010, all or a portion of 36 of our hotels, including Le Méridien Piccadilly discussed below, are subject
to ground leases, generally with multiple renewal options, all of which are accounted for as operating leases. For lease agreements with scheduled rent increases, we recognize the lease expense ratably over the term of the lease. Certain of these
leases contain provisions for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts. Additionally, the rental payments under one lease are based on real estate tax assessments.

Le Méridien Piccadilly

On July, 22, 2010, we acquired a leasehold interest in Le Méridien, Piccadilly in London (see Note 11 —
“Acquisitions”). In conjunction with the acquisition, we assumed the existing lease agreement for the use of the property, which includes both the land and the building and includes minimum payments and contingent payments based on the
operation of the hotel. Upon acquisition, we calculated the fair value of the lease based on its expected lease payments discounted at a risk adjusted rate of 10% and allocated the value to its land and building components. The portion of the lease
allocated to the land is considered an operating lease and we expense the associated lease payments to ground rent over the life of the lease. The portion of the lease allocated to the building is considered a capital lease, as it extends beyond the
useful life of the asset. Therefore, we recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of £38 million ($58 million) based on the fair value of the expected lease payments over the life of the lease. We amortize the capital lease asset
over the expected useful life of the asset, or 40 years. Amortization of the capital lease asset is included in depreciation and amortization. We amortize the capital lease obligation using the effective interest method and an implicit rate based on
the minimum lease payments. Contingent payments based on the operations of the hotel that exceed the minimum payments will be expensed as incurred.

Other Lease Information

We also have leases on facilities used in our
former restaurant business, some of which we subsequently subleased. These leases and subleases contain one or more renewal options, generally for five or ten-year periods. The restaurant leases are accounted for as operating leases. Our lease
activities also include leases entered into by our hotels for various types of equipment, such as computer equipment, vehicles and telephone systems. Equipment leases are accounted for as either operating or capital leases depending on the
characteristics of the particular lease arrangement. Equipment leases that are characterized as capital leases are classified as furniture and equipment and are depreciated over the life of the lease. The amortization charge applicable to
capitalized leases is included in depreciation expense.

General

The following table presents the future minimum annual rental commitments required under non-cancelable leases for which we are the lessee
as of December 31, 2010. Minimum payments for the operating leases have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants of approximately $6 million payable to us under non-cancelable subleases.

We remain contingently liable on certain leases relating to our former restaurant business. Such
contingent liabilities aggregated $18 million as of December 31, 2010. However, management considers the likelihood of any material funding related to these leases to be remote.

8. Employee Stock Plans

In connection with Host Inc.’s conversion to a REIT, Host L.P. assumed the employee obligations of Host Inc. Upon the issuance of Host Inc.’s common stock under either of the two stock-based
compensation plans described below, Host L.P. will issue to Host Inc. common OP units of an equivalent value. Accordingly, these liabilities and related disclosures are included in both Host Inc.’s and Host L.P.’s consolidated financial
statements.

Host Inc. maintains two stock-based compensation plans, the Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan (the
“2009 Comprehensive Plan”), whereby Host Inc. may award to participating employees (i) restricted shares of Host Inc.’s common stock, (ii) options to purchase our common stock and (iii) deferred shares of our common
stock and the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). At December 31, 2010, there were approximately 19.2 million shares of Host Inc.’s common stock reserved and available for issuance under the 2009 Comprehensive Plan.

We recognize costs resulting from share-based payment transactions in our financial statements over their vesting periods. We classify
share-based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity awards or liability awards. The classification of restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options.
Equity awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. Liability classified awards are re-measured to fair value each reporting period. The value of all restricted stock awards, less estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the
period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award—the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite
service. The senior executive restricted stock awards have been classified as liability awards, primarily due to settlement features that allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax requirements in
excess of the statutory minimum withholding. Other stock awards have been classified as equity awards as these awards do not have this optional tax withholding feature.

On May 14, 2009, our stockholders approved the 2009 Comprehensive Plan. The 2009 Comprehensive Plan currently has 25.5 million shares authorized, which includes incremental shares approved on
May 7, 2010 to reflect our 2009 stock dividend, that can be issued for stock-based compensation to employees and directors. Shares described below that were granted after this date were issued under this plan. We granted 5.0 million
restricted shares to senior executives that vest in 2010 and 2011 and 1.0 million stock options under this plan. We also granted 0.2 million restricted shares to other employees at a per share price of $10.40.

Prior to the adoption of the 2009 Comprehensive Plan, we granted 2.4 million restricted shares and 0.4 million stock options to
senior executives that had a requisite service period through December 31, 2009. These shares were granted under our previous 1997 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan (the “1997 Comprehensive Plan”) which is not in effect as
of December 31, 2009. We also granted 0.2 million restricted shares to upper middle management during 2009 through the 1997 Comprehensive Plan.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded compensation expense of approximately $39.6 million, $20.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Shares granted in 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled
0.4 million, 9.0 million and 0.3 million, respectively, while 2.6 million, 2.2 million and 0.3 million vested during those years. Approximately 4.3 million shares are unvested as of December 31, 2010 with a
weighted average fair value of $10.30 per share.

Senior Executive Restricted Stock

During 2009, Host Inc. granted shares to senior executives that vest through year end 2011 in three annual installments (the “2009
– 2011 Plan”). Vesting for these shares is determined based on (1) personal performance based on the achievement of specific management business objectives and (2) market performance based on the achievement of total shareholder
return on a relative basis. These awards are considered liability awards; therefore we recognize compensation expense over the requisite period based on the fair value of the award at the balance sheet date. The fair value of the personal
performance awards are based on management’s estimate of shares that will vest during the requisite service period at the balance sheet market rate. The fair value of the awards that vest based on market performance is estimated using a
simulation or Monte Carlo method. For the purpose of the simulation at year end 2010, we assumed a volatility of 82.9%, which is calculated based on the volatility of our stock price over the last three years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.02%,
which reflects the yield on a 3-year Treasury bond, and stock betas of 1.062 and 1.377 compared to the Lodging composite index and the REIT composite index, respectively, based on three years of historical price data. The number of shares issued is
adjusted for forfeitures.

Under the 2009-2011 Plan, we granted a total of 7.5 million shares (0.3 million in 2010
and 7.2 million in 2009). The grants in 2010 primarily relate to new hires or promotions. Of the 7.5 million shares granted, vesting for approximately 48% of the shares is based on the satisfaction of personal performance goals set by each
executive, approximately 26% is based on the achievement of total shareholder return on a relative basis compared to the NAREIT index and approximately 26% is based on the achievement of total shareholder return in comparison to eight other lodging
companies. Shares that vest based on market conditions that are not earned in any given year are still outstanding and may be earned based on our cumulative relative market performance for the period from January 1, 2009 through
December 31, 2011.

During the first quarter of 2006, Host Inc. granted shares to senior executives that vested through
year end 2008 in three annual installments (the “2006 – 2008 Plan”). The plan concluded as of December 31, 2008 and all shares were either vested or forfeited. Vesting for these shares was determined both on continued employment
and market performance based on the achievement of total shareholder return on an absolute and relative basis. Approximately 110,000 of the shares remaining under the plan vested as of December 31, 2008 and were issued on February 5, 2009.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded compensation expense of approximately $36 million, $19 million and
$2 million respectively, related to the restricted stock awards to senior executives. Based on the valuation criteria above, the total unrecognized compensation cost that relates to nonvested restricted stock awards at December 31, 2010
was approximately $32 million, which, if earned, will be recognized over the weighted average of one year. The following table is a summary of the status of our senior executive plans for the three years ended December 31, 2010. The fair
values for the awards below are based on the fair value at the respective transaction dates, as the awards are classified as liability awards.

(1)

Shares that vest at December 31 of each year are issued to the employees in the first quarter of the following year, although the requisite service period is
complete. Accordingly, the 0.8 million shares issued in 2010 include shares vested at December 31, 2009, after adjusting for shares withheld to meet employee tax requirements. The shares withheld for employee tax requirements were valued
at $6.9 million, $0.6 million and $1.6 million, for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Employee Stock Options

As part of the 2009 Comprehensive Plan, Host Inc. granted .1 million and 1.4 million stock options during 2010 and 2009, respectively. The options expire ten years after the grant date. Vesting
for these shares is based on continuing employment. The fair value of the stock options was estimated on the date of grant based on a simulation/Monte Carlo method. For the options granted in 2009 and 2010, we assumed a volatility between 49% and
62%, which is measured over a historical period based on the life of the options, generally five to six years. We also assumed a risk free interest rate which ranged from 2.0% to 3.1% and an average dividend yield of 5%.

On December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, approximately 518,000 and 464,000 of the options vested and we recorded
approximately $1.8 million and $0.8 million in compensation expense for these options in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No other options were granted between December 2002 and December 2008. The following table summarizes the stock option grants
during the year:

The following table is a summary of the status of Host Inc.’s stock option plans that have been

The following table summarized the information about stock options at December 31, 2010.

Other Stock Plans

In addition to the stock plans described above, we maintain an upper-middle management plan, an employee stock purchase plan and, in 2009, granted broad-based stock awards to all employees. These awards
are all time-based equity awards that vest within three years of the grant date and are expensed based on the grant date fair value. During 2010, 2009 and 2008 we granted 120,000 shares, 331,000 shares and 51,000 shares, respectively, under these
programs and recorded expenses of $2.2 million, $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

9. Profit Sharing and Postemployment Benefit Plans

We contribute to defined contribution plans for the benefit of employees meeting certain eligibility requirements and electing
participation in the plans. The discretionary amount to be matched by us is determined annually by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors. Our recorded liability for this obligation is not material. Payments for these items were not material for the
three years ended December 31, 2010.

10. Discontinued Operations

We disposed of two hotels in 2010 (one of which was classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2009), six hotels in 2009 and two hotels in 2008. The 2009 dispositions include one hotel for which
our ground lease expired in 2009 and, in connection therewith, the hotel reverted back to the ground lessor in 2010. The operations for these hotels are included in discontinued operations. The following table summarizes the revenues, income before

11. Acquisitions

We record the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests at fair value as of the acquisition date. Furthermore, acquisition-related costs, such as broker fees, transfer taxes, due
diligence costs and legal and accounting fees, are expensed in the period incurred and are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets. We acquired four hotel assets during 2010 and recorded $8 million of
acquisition-related expenses. The acquisitions are consistent with our strategy of acquiring luxury and upper upscale hotels in major urban markets. We recorded the purchase price of the acquired assets and liabilities at the estimated fair value on
the date of purchase. For 2010, our property acquisitions were as follows:

•

on September 30, 2010, we acquired the 245-room JW Marriott, Rio de Janeiro for approximately R$80 million ($47 million);

•

on September 2, 2010, we formed a joint venture with a subsidiary of Istithmar World to purchase the 270-room W New York, Union Square. We have a
90% interest and serve as the managing member of the joint venture and, therefore, consolidate the entity. The joint venture purchased the hotel for $188 million, which, in addition to cash consideration, includes the assumption of $115 million of
mortgage debt, with a fair value of $119 million, and other liabilities valued at $8.5 million. The fair value of the debt was determined using the present value of future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the acquisition, the joint
venture purchased restricted cash and FF&E reserve funds at the hotel of $11 million;

•

on August 11, 2010, we acquired the 424-room Westin Chicago River North for approximately $165 million; and

•

on July 22, 2010, we acquired the leasehold interest in the 266-room Le Méridien Piccadilly in London, England for £64 million
($98 million), including cash consideration of approximately £31 million ($47 million) and the assumption of a £33 million ($51 million) mortgage which approximates fair value. As part of the purchase of the leasehold
interest, we acquired restricted cash at the hotel of £4 million ($6 million). In connection with the acquisition, we assumed a capital lease obligation which we valued at £38 million ($58 million). The capital lease obligation
is included in debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and increased the book value of the leasehold interest purchased (See Note 7 – “Leases”). We also recorded a deferred tax liability of £19 million
($30 million) and a deferred tax asset of £11 million ($17 million) and goodwill of £8 million ($13 million) related to the difference in the hotel valuation measured at fair value on the acquisition date and the
tax basis of the asset. We drew £37 million ($56 million) from our credit facility to fund the cash portion of the acquisition.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions (in millions):

Our summarized unaudited consolidated pro forma results of operations, assuming the
acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2009, are as follows (in millions, except per share and per unit amounts):

For 2010, we have included $56.5 million of revenues and $3.1 million of net income in our
consolidated statements of operations related to the operations of our hotels acquired.

12. Notes Receivable

On April 13, 2010, we acquired, at a discount, the two most junior tranches of a €427 million ($581 million) mortgage loan that is secured by six hotels located in Europe with a face
value of €64 million ($87 million). Interest payments for the tranches are based on the 90-day EURIBOR rate plus 303 basis points, or approximately 3.8%, and the loan is performing. We record interest income on the loan based on the
implicit interest rate required to accrete the book value of the receivable to an amount equal to the expected cash receipts for both the principal and interest through maturity. For 2010, we recorded interest income of €1.2 million ($1.6
million). The borrower exercised its first of two, one-year extension options in October 2010. The execution of the second one-year extension is subject to debt service coverage requirements.

13. Fair Value Measurements

Overview

Our recurring fair value measurements consist of the valuation of
our derivative instruments, which may or may not be designated as accounting hedges. No transactions requiring non-recurring fair value measurements



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

occurred in 2010 other than those associated with our acquisitions discussed in Note 11 – “Acquisitions.” Non-recurring fair value measurements during 2009 consisted of the
impairment of four of our hotel properties and an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in the European joint venture.

In evaluating the fair value of both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, GAAP outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market
assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and a reporting entity’s own assumptions about market data (unobservable inputs). The requirements are intended to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and
the related disclosures. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date in an orderly transaction (an exit price). Assets and liabilities are measured using inputs
from three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:

Level 1 — Inputs are quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide
pricing on an ongoing basis.

Level 2 — Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active (markets with few transactions), inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield
curves, etc.), and inputs that derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means.

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the pricing of an asset or liability when observable inputs are not
available.

The following table details the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities that are required to be
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as non-recurring fair value measurements that we completed during 2009 (there were none in 2010) due to the impairment of non-financial assets (in millions):

These derivative contracts have been designated as hedging instruments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The fair value measurements are as of the measurement date of the impairment and may not reflect the book value as of December 31, 2009.

Derivatives and Hedging

Interest rate swap derivatives.

We have three interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount totaling
$300 million related to The Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa mortgage loan in the amount of $300 million. We entered into the derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of the fixed-rate
mortgage that occur as a result of changes in the 3-month LIBOR rate. As a result, we will pay a floating interest rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR plus a spread which ranges from 2.7% to 3.2%, as opposed to the fixed rate of 5.531%, on the notional
amount of $300 million through March 1, 2014. During 2010 and 2009, the cash settlement received under the swap agreement decreased interest expense by $6 million and $1 million, respectively.

We have designated these derivatives as fair value hedges. The derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the
date of measurement. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, we recorded an asset of $10.6 million and a liability of $1 million,
respectively, related to the fair value of the swaps. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives are largely offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the underlying debt due to changes in the 3-month LIBOR rate, which is recorded
as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt, which was not significant for the periods presented, is considered the
ineffective portion of the hedging relationship and is recognized in net income/loss.

Foreign Currency Forward Purchase
Contracts.

We have four foreign currency forward purchase contracts totaling €80 million (approximately $114 million) to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net
investment in the European joint venture. Under these transactions, we will sell the Euro amount, and receive the U.S. Dollar amount on the forward purchase date. These derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a
net investment in a foreign operation and are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the equity portion of our balance sheet. The forward purchase contracts are valued based on the
forward yield curve of the Euro to U.S. Dollar forward exchange rate on the date of measurement. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps. The following table summarizes our four foreign
currency purchase contracts (in millions):

Impairment

Impairment of Hotel Properties.

We evaluate our hotel portfolio for impairment when events or circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. During 2009, we
identified several properties that may be sold prior to the end of their previously estimated useful lives or that had current or projected operating losses or other events or circumstances indicating a reduction in value or change in intended use.
Properties exhibiting these characteristics were tested for impairment based on management’s estimate of expected future undiscounted cash flows from operations and sale during our expected remaining hold period. The fair value of these
properties was determined based on either a discounted cash flow analysis or negotiated sales price. Based on these assessments, we recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $97 million for 2009 of which $20 million is included in
depreciation and amortization and the remaining $77 million in discontinued operations. There were no impairment charges recorded in 2010.



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Other-than-temporary impairment of investment.

During 2009, we determined
that our investment in the European joint venture was impaired based on the reduction of distributable cash flows from the joint venture, which has been caused primarily by a decline in cash flows generated by the properties. We believe this
impairment to be other-than-temporary because the time period over which the joint venture may be able to improve operations such that our investment would be fully recoverable is constrained by the remaining life of the joint venture. As a result,
we recorded a non-cash impairment charge totaling $34 million in equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates based on the difference between our investment’s estimated fair value and its carrying value. As of December 31, 2010, we
determined that our investment was not impaired.

Other Assets and Liabilities

Fair Value of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities.

We did not elect the fair measurement option for any of our other
financial assets or liabilities. Notes receivable and other financial assets are valued based on the expected future cash flows discounted at risk-adjusted rates and are adjusted to reflect the effects of foreign currency translation. Valuations for
secured debt and our credit facility are determined based on the expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates. Senior notes and the Exchangeable Senior Debentures are valued based on quoted market prices. The fair values of financial
instruments not included in this table are estimated to be equal to their carrying amounts. The fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities and other financial instruments are shown below:

14. Relationship with Marriott International

We have entered into various agreements with Marriott, including the management of approximately 60% of our owned hotels, the management of 53 hotels leased from HPT and financing for joint ventures or
partnerships, including our JW Marriott Hotel, Mexico City, Mexico and certain limited administrative services.

In 2010, 2009
and 2008, we paid Marriott $111 million, $105 million and $178 million, respectively, in hotel management fees for our owned hotels and approximately $1 million in franchise fees for each of 2010, 2009 and 2008. Additionally, in
2010, we paid $7 million of management fees for the hotels leased from HPT subsequent to the cancellation of the sublease on July 6, 2010. Included in the management fees are amounts paid to The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, LLC (Ritz-Carlton),
Courtyard Management Corporation and Residence Inn Management Corporation.

We enter into negotiations with Marriott from time
to time in order to secure mutually beneficial modifications to the terms of management agreements on an individual or portfolio-wide basis, most typically in connection with repositioning projects or substantial capital investments at our
properties. We negotiated amendments to various management agreements with Marriott which became effective in 2006 and agreed, among other matters, to waive performance termination tests through the end of fiscal year 2009, which, based on the terms
of agreement, were extended through fiscal year 2011, to modify certain extension tests which condition the manager’s ability to renew the management agreements, and to extend certain contracts for ten additional years. As part of this
negotiation, Marriott agreed to make cash payments to us, over time, to reduce an existing cap on the costs and expenses related to chain services that are provided on a centralized basis, as well as to establish a cap on certain other costs, to
provide us with an incentive to increase our capital expenditures at the hotels through 2008, to waive certain deferred management fees, and to modify the incentive management fee on certain contracts. We agreed to use a portion of Marriott’s
cash payments for brand reinvestment projects at various hotels in our portfolio.

15. Hotel Management Agreements and Operating and License Agreements

Our hotels are subject to management agreements under which various operators, including Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt, Swissôtel,
Hilton, Four Seasons, Fairmont and Starwood, operate our hotels in exchange for the payment of a management fee. The agreements generally provide for both base and incentive management fees that are based on hotel sales and operating profit,
respectively. As part of the management agreements, the manager furnishes the hotels with certain chain services which are generally provided on a central or regional basis to all hotels in the manager’s hotel system. Chain services include
central training, advertising and promotion, national reservation systems, computerized payroll and accounting services, and such additional services as needed which may be more efficiently performed on a centralized basis. Costs and expenses
incurred in providing such services are allocated among the hotels managed, owned or leased by the manager on a fair and equitable basis. In addition, our managers will generally have a guest rewards program which will be charged to all of the
hotels that participate in the program.

We are obligated to provide the manager with sufficient funds, generally 5% of
revenue generated at the hotel, to cover the cost of (a) certain non-routine repairs and maintenance to the hotels which are normally capitalized; and (b) replacements and renewals to the hotels’ furniture, fixtures and equipment.
Under certain circumstances, we will be required to establish escrow accounts for such purposes under terms outlined in the agreements.

Marriott International

As of December 31, 2010, 66 of our hotels were subject to management agreements under which Marriott or one of their subsidiaries
manages the hotels, generally for an initial term of 15 to 20 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of Marriott. Marriott typically receives a base fee of three percent of gross revenues and incentive management fees generally equal to
20% of operating profit after we have received a priority return. In addition, one of these hotels also is subject to a royalty agreement, which agreement provides an incentive royalty fee equal to one percent of net revenues. We have the option to
terminate certain management agreements if specified performance or extension thresholds are not satisfied. A single agreement may be canceled under certain conditions, although such cancellation will not trigger the cancellation of any other
agreement.

Additionally, while most of our management agreements are not terminable prior to their full term, we have
negotiated rights with respect to 18 specified Marriott-branded hotels to terminate management agreements in connection with the sale of these hotels, subject to certain limitations, including the number of agreements that can be terminated per
year, limitations measured by EBITDA, and limitations requiring that a significant part of such hotels maintain the Marriott brand affiliation. The described termination rights may be exercised without payment of a termination fee, except for one of
the specified hotels wherein a termination fee is required if it does not maintain the Marriott brand affiliation.

We have a
franchise agreement with Marriott for one hotel. Pursuant to the franchise agreement, we pay a franchise fee based on a percentage of room sales and food and beverage sales, as well as certain other fees for advertising and reservations. Franchise
fees for room sales are approximately six percent of sales, while fees for food and beverage sales are approximately three percent of sales. The franchise agreement has a term of 30 years.

Ritz-Carlton

As of December 31, 2010, we hold management agreements
with Ritz-Carlton, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marriott, to manage eight of our hotels. These agreements have an initial term of 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of Ritz-Carlton. Base management fees vary from two to five
percent of sales and incentive management fees, if any, are generally equal to 20% of available cash flow or operating profit, after we have received a priority return as defined in the agreements.

Starwood

As of December 31, 2010, 20 of our domestic hotels are subject to operating and license agreements with Starwood, under which Starwood operates the hotels, for an initial term of 20 years, with two
renewal terms of 10 years each. Starwood receives compensation in the form of a base fee of 1% of annual gross operating revenues, and an incentive fee of 20% of annual gross operating profit, after we have received a priority return of 10.75% on
our purchase price and other investments in the hotels.

The license agreements address matters relating to the subject brand,
including rights to use service marks, logos, symbols and trademarks, such as those associated with Westin, Sheraton, W, Luxury Collection and St. Regis, as well as matters relating to compliance with certain standards and policies (including
through other agreements in the case of certain hotels) and the provision of certain system program and centralized services. The license agreements have an initial term of 20 years each, with two renewal terms of 10 years each at the option of the
licensor. Licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees of 5% of room sales and 2% of food and beverage sales.

We have termination rights relating to the operating agreements on 10 specified hotels upon the sale of those hotels. Such termination
rights are active with respect to one of such hotels. With respect to nine of the 10 specified hotels, we have the right beginning in 2016 to sell 35% of such hotels (measured by EBITDA), not to exceed two hotels annually, free and clear of the
existing operating agreement over a period of time without the payment of a termination fee. With respect to any termination of an operating agreement on sale, the proposed purchaser would need to meet the requirements for transfer under the
applicable license agreement.

One of our international hotels is subject to an operating and license agreement with Starwood,
under which Starwood operates the hotel for a term of 15 years. Starwood receives a combined base and license fee equal to three percents of total revenues.

Other Managers

As of December 31, 2010, we also hold management
agreements with hotel management companies such as Hyatt, Hilton, Four Seasons and Fairmont for 17 of our hotels. These agreements generally provide for an initial term of 10 to 20 years, with renewal terms at the option of either party or, in some
cases, the hotel management company of up to an additional one to 20 years. The agreements generally provide for payment of base management fees equal to one to four percent of sales. These agreements also provide for incentive management fees
generally equal to 10 to 30 percent of available cash flow, operating profit, or net operating income, as defined in the agreements, after we have received a priority return.

16. Geographic and Business Segment Information

We consider each one of our hotels to be an operating segment, none of which meets the threshold for a reportable segment. We also allocate resources and assess operating performance based on individual
hotels. All of our other real estate investment activities (primarily our office buildings) are immaterial and meet the aggregation criteria, and thus, we report one segment: hotel ownership. Our foreign operations consist of four properties located
in Canada, two properties located in Chile, one property located in Brazil, one property located in Mexico and one property located in the United Kingdom. There were no intersegment sales during the periods presented. The following table presents
revenues and long-lived assets for each of the geographical areas in which we operate (in millions):

17. Guarantees and Contingencies

We have certain guarantees which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to various dispositions,
spin-offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party. We consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote. The
guarantees are listed below:

•

We remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non-lodging properties. These primarily represent certain divested restaurants
that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments. The aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately $18 million as of December 31, 2010.

•

In 1997, we owned Leisure Park Venture Limited Partnership, which owns and operates a senior living facility. We spun-off the partnership to
Barceló Crestline Corporation, formerly Crestline Capital Corporation, in the REIT conversion, but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to $14.7 million of municipal bonds issued by the New Jersey
Economic Development Authority through their maturity in 2027. However, to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee, we have been indemnified by Barceló Crestline Corporation, who, in turn, is indemnified by the
current owner of the facility.

•

In connection with the sale of two hotels in January 2005, we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases. The
future minimum lease payments are approximately $13 million through the full term of the leases, including renewal options. We believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote, and in each case, we have been indemnified by
the purchaser of the hotel.

•

In connection with the Starwood acquisition, we have three properties with environmental liabilities, primarily asbestos in non-public areas of the
properties, for which we have recorded the present value of the liability, or approximately $3 million. The amount is based on management’s estimate of the timing and future costs to remediate the liability. We will record the accretion
expense over the period we intend to hold the hotel or until the item is remediated.

18. Legal Proceedings

On April 27, 2005, we initiated a lawsuit against Keystone-Texas Property Holding Corporation seeking a declaration that a provision of the ground lease for the property under the San Antonio
Marriott Rivercenter was valid and claiming that Keystone had breached that lease provision. On October 18, 2006, Keystone filed an amended counterclaim and later, a third party claim, alleging that we had tortiously interfered with
Keystone’s attempted sale of the property and that we slandered Keystone’s title to the property.

On
February 8, 2010, we received an adverse jury verdict in the 166th Judicial District Court of Bexar County, Texas. The jury found that we tortiously interfered with the attempted sale by Keystone of the land under the San Antonio Marriott
Rivercenter and awarded Keystone $34.3 million in damages plus statutory interest. In addition, the jury found that we slandered Keystone’s title to the property and awarded Keystone $39 million in damages plus statutory interest. Keystone will
only be entitled to receive one of these damages awards. On February 12, 2010, the jury awarded Keystone $7.5 million in exemplary damages with respect to the second claim. The trial court, however, subsequently granted our motion to disregard
the jury’s exemplary damages award. Based on the range of possible outcomes, we have accrued a potential litigation loss of approximately $47 million.

On June 3, 2010, the trial court entered its final judgment, reciting and incorporating the jury’s verdict and awarding Keystone damages for slander of title, interest and attorneys’ fees.
On August 26, 2010, we filed our notice of appeal based, in part, on what we believe to be numerous erroneous rulings which adversely impacted the jury’s verdict. We intend to vigorously pursue these issues on appeal.

We are also involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business and are vigorously defending these claims;
however, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. We believe, based on currently available information, that the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.

19. Supplemental Guarantor and Non-Guarantor Information for Host L.P.

A portion of our subsidiaries guarantee our senior notes. Among the subsidiaries not providing guarantees are those owning 25 of our
full-service hotels, our taxable REIT subsidiaries and all of their respective subsidiaries, and HMH HPT RIBM LLC and HMH HPT CBM LLC, the lessees of the Residence Inn and Courtyard properties, respectively. The separate financial statements of each
guaranteeing subsidiary (each, a “Guarantor Subsidiary”) are not presented because we have concluded that such financial statements are not material to investors. The guarantee of each Guarantor Subsidiary is full and unconditional and
joint and several and each Guarantor Subsidiary is wholly owned by us.

21. Subsequent Events

On February 18, 2011, we completed the acquisition of a portfolio of seven midscale and upscale hotels in New Zealand for approximately $145 million, including $80 million of mortgage debt. This
acquisition is consistent with our acquisition strategy in the Asia-Pacific where, in addition to acquiring upper upscale properties, we also will pursue the acquisition or development of midscale and upscale hotels. The properties are located in
the cities of Auckland, Queenstown, Christchurch and Wellington and will be operated by Accor under the ibis and Novotel brands. The portfolio is comprised of the following hotels:

•

The 273-room Hotel Novotel Queenstown Lakeside;

•

The 193-room Hotel Novotel Christchurch Cathedral Square;

•

The 147-room Hotel Novotel Auckland Ellerslie;

•

The 139-room Hotel Novotel Wellington;

•

The 200-room Hotel ibis Wellington;

•

The 155-room Hotel ibis Christchurch; and

•

The 100-room Hotel ibis Ellerslie.

Due to the timing of the acquisition, the initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed. On February 22, 2011, Christchurch, New Zealand experienced an earthquake that resulted in
the evacuation of the Hotel Novotel Christchruch Cathedral Square and the Hotel ibis Christchurch. Due to the restricted access to these sites, we have been unable to determine the extent of any property damage that may have occurred.

close in March of 2011, subject to customary closing conditions.

•

In February 2011, we entered into an agreement to acquire the entity that owns the 1,625-room Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego and certain related
rights, for $570 million. The transaction is expected to close in March of 2011, and is subject to various closing conditions, including approval by the San Diego Unified Port District.
