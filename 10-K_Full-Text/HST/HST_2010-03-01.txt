The Lodging Industry

The lodging industry in the United States consists of
private and public entities that operate in an extremely diversified market under a variety of brand names. The lodging industry has several key participants:

•

Owners—own the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel. These properties may be branded and
operated under the manager’s brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager. The properties also may be operated as an independent hotel (unaffiliated with any brand) by an
independent hotel manager. We operate as an owner of lodging properties.

•

Owner/Managers—own the hotel and operate the property with their own management team. These properties may be branded under a franchise agreement,
operated as an independent hotel (unaffiliated with any brand) or operated under the owner’s brand. We are restricted from operating and managing hotels under applicable REIT laws.

•

Franchisors—own a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system. Franchisors
provide their branded hotels with brand recognition, marketing support and centralized reservation systems.

•

Franchisor/Manager—own a brand or brands and also operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee.

•

Manager—operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner, but do not, themselves, own a brand. The hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement
or as an independent hotel (unaffiliated with any brand).

The hotel manager is responsible for the
day-to-day operation of the hotels, including the employment of hotel staff, the determination of room rates, the development of sales and marketing plans, the preparation of operating and capital expenditure budgets and the preparation of financial
reports for the owner. They typically receive fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel.

Our industry is
influenced by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms. Lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy in addition to local market factors that stimulate travel to specific
destinations. In particular, economic indicators such as GDP growth,



business investment and employment growth are some of the primary drivers of lodging demand. Between 2003 and 2007, broad growth in the economy led to increases in demand. By contrast, slower
economic growth and lower levels of capital investment typically slow the rate of demand growth for the lodging industry. Lodging demand declined significantly in the second half of 2008 as the overall weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly the
turmoil in the credit markets, weakness in the housing market, and volatile energy and commodity costs, resulted in considerable negative pressure on both consumer and business spending. This trend accelerated in 2009, as the global economic
recession caused a significant decline in corporate group and transient lodging demand. While we have seen some signs that lodging demand has begun to stabilize, we believe that the industry will experience a continued decline in revenue until the
key economic indicators discussed above display consistent growth, but that overall occupancy levels will increase slightly from 2009 to 2010.

Lodging supply growth is generally driven by overall lodging demand, as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development. However, the rate of supply growth also is influenced by
a number of additional factors, including the availability of capital, interest rates, construction costs and unique market considerations. Additionally, the relatively long lead-time required to complete the development of hotels, while making
supply growth relatively easier to forecast than demand growth, increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry. As illustrated in the charts below, at different points in the cycle, demand and supply may increase or
decrease in a dissimilar manner such that demand may increase when there is no new supply or supply may grow when demand is declining. Since the second half of 2008, the stress in the credit markets has made financing for new hotel construction
extremely difficult to obtain. This, coupled with the decline in lodging demand due to the global economic recession, has caused a significant reduction in new hotel construction starts. We expect this trend will continue through 2010. We anticipate
that the pace of supply growth will be below historical averages for at least 2010 and 2011, which is consistent with analysis provided by STR Global.



Revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) is an operational measure commonly used in
the hotel industry to evaluate hotel performance. RevPAR represents the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved, but excludes other revenue generated by a hotel property, such as food and beverage,
parking and other guest service revenues. The charts below detail the supply, demand and RevPAR growth for the U.S. lodging industry and for the luxury and upper-upscale segment for 2005 to 2009 based on data provided by STR Global.

Business Strategy

Our primary long-term business objective is to provide superior total returns to our stockholders through a combination of appreciation in asset values and growth in earnings and dividends. To achieve
this objective we seek to:

•

Acquire luxury and upper upscale properties in urban and resort/conference destinations that are operated by leading management companies. These
investments will be primarily located in gateway cities, both domestic and international, with significant appeal to multiple customer segments;

•

Maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management and strategic capital allocation;

•

Maintain a strong balance sheet with a low leverage level and balanced debt maturities in order to minimize the cost of capital and to maximize our
financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging business cycle;

•

Expand our global portfolio holdings and revenue sources by creating investment funds and joint ventures that diversify our investments, while reducing
market specific risk; and

•

Dispose of non-core assets, including hotels that are at a competitive risk or that are located in suburban or slower-growth markets.

Asset Management.

As the largest REIT owner of luxury and
upper-upscale properties in the U.S., we are in a unique position to work with the managers of our hotels to maximize revenues while minimizing operating costs. The size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading
operators and brands in the industry allow us to benchmark similar hotels and identify best practices, evaluate return on investment and repositioning opportunities and identify efficiencies that can be communicated to our managers. Areas of focus
include enhancing revenue management for rooms, food and beverage and other services, reducing operating costs and identifying operating efficiencies, all of which improve the long-term profitability of the hotel.

Another key component of our asset management strategy is our capital expenditure programs. These programs are designed to increase
profitability by maximizing the value of our portfolio and maintaining our high standards for product quality, as well as those of our managers. We explore opportunities to improve the performance of our assets through investing in profit-generating
projects and customer amenities that will improve cash flow. Our asset management and design and construction departments review potential capital investments to ensure that each of our properties is in high-quality physical condition, highly
competitive in the market and consistent with brand standards on a continuing basis. Our capital expenditures generally fall into three broad categories: renewal and replacement expenditures, return on investment (or “ROI”)/repositioning
expenditures and value enhancement projects.

Renewal and replacement expenditures.

We work
closely with our managers to ensure that renewal and replacement expenditures are spent efficiently in order to maximize the profitability of the hotel. Typically, room refurbishments occur at intervals of approximately seven years, but the timing
may vary based on the type of property and equipment being replaced. These refurbishments generally are divided into the following types: soft goods, case goods and infrastructure. Soft goods include items such as carpeting, bed spreads, curtains
and wall vinyl and may require more frequent updates in order to maintain brand quality standards. Hard goods include items such as dressers, desks, couches, restaurant and meeting room chairs and tables and are generally not replaced as frequently.
Infrastructure includes the physical plant of the hotel, including the roof, elevators, façade and fire systems, which are regularly maintained and then replaced at the end of their useful lives.

ROI/repositioning expenditures.

We pursue opportunities to enhance asset value by completing selective capital
improvements outside the scope of typical renewal and replacement capital expenditures. These projects include, for example, significant repositioning of guest rooms, lobbies or food and beverage platforms and



expanding ballroom, spa or conference facilities. These projects also include green initiatives at our properties designed to increase energy efficiency and decrease our properties’ overall
carbon footprint. In certain instances, these ROI/repositioning projects have coincided with the timing of regular maintenance cycles at the properties where we have used the opportunity to significantly improve and upgrade the hotel. These projects
also are designed to take advantage of changing market conditions and the favorable location of our properties. Examples of these projects include:

•

the construction of the 12,000 square foot ballroom at The Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island in 2009;

•

the construction of the 10,000 square foot ballroom at the Harbor Beach Marriott Resort & Spa, which is scheduled for completion in the first
quarter of 2010;

•

the completion of a 62,750 square foot ballroom addition at the Swissôtel Chicago in 2009;

•

the construction of an 8,300 square foot meeting space addition and the renovation of over 60,000 square feet of public space and food and beverage
facilities at the San Francisco Marriott in 2008; and

•

the construction of new food and beverage facilities, renovation of meeting space and the construction of the new 26,000 square foot Atrium Ballroom at
the Atlanta Marriott Marquis in 2007 and 2008.

Value enhancement projects

.    We
seek opportunities to enhance the value of our portfolio by identifying and executing strategies that maximize the highest and best use of all aspects of our properties, such as the development of timeshare or condominium units on excess land, or
the acquisition of air rights or developer entitlements that add value to our portfolio or enhance the value in the event we sell the property.

Acquisitions.

Our acquisition strategy primarily focuses on acquiring either directly or through joint ventures, luxury and upper-upscale hotels domestically and
internationally. We evaluate potential opportunities to acquire hotels at attractive yields and at discounts to replacement cost. Our acquisition strategy focuses on:

•

properties with locations in key markets and gateway cities with high barriers to entry for prospective competitors with strong demand growth
potential;

•

properties operated under premium brand names;

•

properties that further diversify our portfolio, both domestically and internationally; and

•

acquisitions through various structures, including transactions involving portfolios or single asset transactions.

Domestic Acquisitions

.    We look for opportunities to take advantage of the lodging cycle’s effect on
property valuations in order to maximize the potential to achieve returns above our cost of capital and to diversify our risk. In the early part of the previous upturn in the lodging cycle, between 2003 and 2005, we acquired or agreed to acquire 34
hotel properties. This includes a 2005 agreement to purchase a portfolio of 25 domestic and three foreign properties (the “Starwood Portfolio”) from Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (“Starwood”) that was
consummated in 2006. Consistent with our strategic objectives, these acquisitions significantly increased our brand diversification as well as our exposure to new markets, both domestically and internationally, while creating a platform for new
growth opportunities. During the period from the late 2006 through the first half of 2008, we believe that positive lodging fundamentals resulted in premium pricing for lodging assets. Therefore, we did not acquire any domestic hotels during the
period as we believed it would have been less likely that we would achieve our targeted levels of return on investment and profitability at the then current pricing levels. Beginning in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009, as lodging
fundamentals became increasingly negative, almost no luxury and upper-upscale hotels were being marketed or sold. This decline in the acquisition/disposition market intensified as the economic recession became more widespread and the credit markets
collapsed. Management believes that there may be an increase in the number of assets available for purchase in 2011 and 2012 as properties encumbered with very high levels of debt and experiencing reduced cash flows due to the current operating
environment may result in owners and/or lenders making these



properties available for sale. We also may purchase mortgage debt that is secured by hotel properties or mezzanine debt where we believe we can buy the debt at a discount and earn attractive
returns through principal and interest payments or the eventual ownership of the hotel through foreclosure. We did not complete any domestic acquisitions during 2009.

International Acquisitions

.    We established a joint venture in Europe in 2006, which now owns 11 hotels in six countries. We act as the asset manager for these hotels, as well
as an additional hotel in Paris, France. We continue to look for acquisition opportunities in London, Paris, Rome and Brussels.

In 2008, we entered into a joint venture located in the Republic of Singapore as a 25% minority owner, which seeks to acquire hotels in various markets throughout Asia, including China, Japan, and India, and Australia. These acquisitions
could include mid-scale hotels, as well as luxury and upper upscale hotels that are our typical focus. While we currently do not own any hotels in our Asian Joint Venture, we act as the asset manager for two hotels, one of which is located in Tokyo,
Japan and one of which is located in Sydney, Australia in exchange for a fee.

Capital structure and liquidity
profile.

As a REIT, Host is required to distribute 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gain) to its stockholders, and, as a result, generally must rely on external sources of capital to finance growth.
Therefore, we will use a variety of debt and equity instruments to fund our external growth, including senior notes and mortgage debt, exchangeable debentures, common and preferred stock offerings, issuances of Host LP partnership units and joint
ventures/limited partnerships to best take advantage of the prevailing market conditions.

Our capital structure is designed
to maintain an appropriate balance of debt and equity that will allow us to weather weaker periods of lodging demand and provide us with substantial flexibility with respect to our sources of capital. As of February 17, 2010, approximately 80%
of our debt consists of senior notes which are guaranteed by various subsidiaries and secured by pledges in subsidiaries, but are not collateralized by specific hotel properties. The remainder of our debt primarily consists of mortgage indebtedness.
As of February 17, 2010, 99 of our hotels are unencumbered by mortgage debt. The structure of our balance sheet provides flexibility to allow us to access different forms of financing, primarily senior notes and exchangeable debentures, as well
as mortgage debt. Currently, management believes it is prudent, over time, to continue to lower our debt to equity ratio on our balance sheet as we believe lower overall leverage will reduce our cost of capital and earnings volatility and provide us
with the necessary flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that may develop in periods of market duress, which we consider a key competitive advantage. Management anticipates using different financing and investing strategies to lower our
overall leverage. For example, as acquisition opportunities become available, we will look to purchase assets with proceeds from equity offerings. Also, when we believe the lodging cycle and, therefore, asset prices, are at or near their peak, we
will look to sell assets and use the proceeds to further pay down debt.

Joint
Ventures.

We expect to continue to utilize joint ventures to finance external growth. We believe joint ventures provide a significant means to access external capital and spread the inherent risk of hotel
ownership, while providing significant opportunities for positive returns on investment. Our primary focus for joint ventures is currently in international markets, such as in Europe and Asia, which will help to diversify our exposure to market
risk. We will also explore joint venture opportunities in North America and Latin America. We intend to earn a promoted interest and a fee for the asset management of the properties owned by such joint ventures.

Dispositions.

The ability of prospective purchasers to obtain acquisition financing has been adversely
affected by the credit crisis and the overall lack of available debt in 2009. Despite the difficult market conditions for hotel dispositions, we were able to complete the sale of five hotels during 2009 and one in the first quarter of 2010.
Including these recent dispositions, we have sold 29 hotels over the past five years, generally disposing of non-core hotels that are located in suburban and non-target markets. These assets represented properties where



we believed the potential for growth was lower or properties with significant capital expenditure requirements where we did not believe we would generate a significant return on the investment.
However, we may also dispose of core assets when we have the opportunity to capitalize on value enhancement strategies and may apply the proceeds to other business objectives. Proceeds from dispositions have been, or will be, used to repay debt,
fund acquisitions and/or fund ROI/repositioning projects.

Operating Structure

Host operates through an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which substantially all of its properties and assets are held by Host LP, of
which Host is the sole general partner and holds approximately 98% of the outstanding partnership interests or OP units. As a result of the stock dividend issued in December 2009, each OP unit owned by holders other than Host is redeemable, at the
option of the holder, for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of Host common stock multiplied by a factor of 1.021494. Host has the right, however, to acquire any OP unit offered for redemption directly from the holder in
exchange for 1.021494 shares of Host common stock, instead of Host LP redeeming such OP unit for cash. When distinguishing between Host and Host LP, the primary difference is the approximately 2% of the OP units not held by Host as of
February 17, 2009. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations—Dividend Policy”.

Our operating structure is as follows:

Because Host is a REIT, certain tax laws limit the amount of “non-qualifying” income that Host
can earn, including income derived directly from the operation of hotels. As a result, we lease substantially all of our consolidated properties to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS subsidiaries”)
for federal income tax purposes or to third party lessees. Our TRS subsidiaries are subject to



income tax and are therefore not limited as to the amount of non-qualifying income they can generate. The lessees and our TRS subsidiaries enter into agreements with third parties to manage the
operations of the hotels. Our TRS subsidiaries also may own assets engaging in other activities that produce non-qualifying income, such as the development of timeshare or condominium units, subject to certain restrictions. The difference between
the hotels’ net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to Host LP is retained by our TRS subsidiaries as taxable income. Accordingly, the net effect of the TRS leases is that, while, as a REIT, Host is generally exempt from federal
income tax to the extent that we meet specific distribution requirements, among other REIT requirements, a portion of the net operating cash flow from our properties is subject to federal, state and, if applicable, foreign income tax.

Our Hotel Properties

Overview.

Our lodging portfolio consists of 110 luxury and upper-upscale hotels generally located in the central business districts of major cities, near airports and resort/conference destinations that,
because of their locations, typically benefit from barriers to entry by competitors. These properties typically include meeting and banquet facilities, a variety of restaurants and lounges, swimming pools, exercise facilities and/or spas, gift shops
and parking facilities, the combination of which enable them to serve business, leisure and group travelers. Forty-four of our hotels representing approximately 65% of our revenues have over 500 rooms. The average age of our properties is 26 years,
although substantially all of the properties have benefited from significant renovations or major additions, as well as regularly scheduled renewal and replacement and other capital improvements.

The following chart details our hotel portfolio by brand as of February 17, 2010:

(1)

Percentage of revenues is based on 2009 revenues. No individual property contributed more than 7% of total revenues in 2009.



Hotel Properties

.

The following table sets
forth the location and number of rooms of our 110 hotels as of February 17, 2010:



(1)

The land on which this hotel is built is leased from a third party under one or more long-term lease agreements.

(2)

The land, building and improvements are leased from a third party under a long-term lease agreement.

(3)

This property is not wholly owned.

(4)

This property is subject to a ground lease under which we have the option to purchase the land. In prior years, payments under the ground lease, which are determined
annually and are not fixed in nature, reduced the deferred ground rent liability and, in 2008, were applied to the deferred purchase price of the land. Accordingly, no expense was included in our results of operations for ground rent expense in
those years. In the first quarter of 2009, a portion of the payments fully funded the deferred purchase price, and the remainder of the payment for the first quarter of 2009 and all subsequent payments were accounted for as ground rent expense. We
have the ability to buy the fee simple interest in the land under the hotel for an incremental payment of $19.9 million through 2017.



Competition

The lodging industry is highly competitive. Competition is often specific to individual markets and is based on a number
of factors, including location, brand, guest facilities and amenities, level of service, room rates and the quality of accommodations. The lodging industry is generally viewed as consisting of six different segments, each of which caters to a
discrete set of customer tastes and needs: luxury, upper-upscale, upscale, midscale (with and without food and beverage service) and economy. The classification of a property is based on lodging industry standards, which take into consideration many
factors such as guest facilities and amenities, level of service and quality of accommodations. Most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties, under such brand names as Ritz-Carlton

®

, Fairmont

®

, Four Seasons

®

, The Luxury
Collection

®

, St. Regis

®

and W

®

, or as upper-upscale
properties, under such brand names as Marriott

®

, Hyatt

®

, Westin

®

, Hilton

®

, Sheraton

®

, Swissôtel

®

and
Delta

®

.

(1)

While our hotels primarily compete with other hotels in the luxury and upper-upscale segments, they also may compete
with hotels in other lower-tier segments.

We believe our properties enjoy competitive advantages associated with the hotel
brands under which they operate. The international marketing programs and reservation systems of these brands, combined with the strong management systems and expertise they provide, should enable our properties to perform favorably in terms of both
occupancy and room rates. In addition, repeat guest business is enhanced by guest reward or guest recognition programs offered by most of these brands. Nevertheless, many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from
converting, franchising or developing other hotel properties in our markets. As a result, our hotels in a given market often compete with other hotels that our managers may own, invest in, manage or franchise.

We also compete with other REITs and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities,
both domestically and internationally, as we attempt to position our portfolio to take best advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers.

Seasonality

Our hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate
seasonality, which varies based on the individual hotel property and the region. Additionally, hotel revenues for our Marriott-managed hotels typically reflect approximately 16 weeks of results in the fourth quarter compared to approximately 12
weeks for each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year. For our non-Marriott managed hotels, the first quarter includes two months of operations, the second and third quarters include three months of operations and the fourth quarter includes
four months of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Reporting Periods” for more information on our fiscal calendar. Hotel sales have historically averaged
approximately 20%, 26%, 22% and 32% for the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively.

Other Real Estate Investments

In addition to our hotels, we have minority partner interests in other real estate investments. We manage these investments
and conduct business through a combination of general and limited partnership and limited liability company interests. All of the debt of these entities is non-recourse to us and our subsidiaries, and the entities are not consolidated in our
financial statements.

European Joint Venture.

We currently own a 32.1% general and
limited partnership interest in a joint venture in Europe (the “European joint venture”) with Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, a Dutch pension fund, and Jasmine Hotels Pte Ltd, an affiliate of the real estate investment company of the
Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd (GIC RE), the real estate investment company of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd. The initial term of the European joint venture is ten years (ending in 2016),

subject to two one-year extensions with partner approval. Due to the ownership structure of the European joint venture and the non-Host limited partners’ rights to cause the dissolution and
liquidation thereof at any time, it is not consolidated in our financial statements. We also act as the asset manager for the hotels owned by the joint venture, as well as one hotel in Paris, France, in exchange for a fee. As of February 17,
2010, the European joint venture owns the following hotels:

Asian Joint
Venture.

We currently own a 25% interest in a joint venture in Asia (the “Asian joint venture”) with RECO Hotels JV Private Limited, an affiliate of GIC RE. The Asian joint venture is structured as a
Singapore Corporation and will explore investment opportunities in various markets throughout Asia, including India, China and Japan, and Australia. The initial term of the Asian joint venture is a period of seven years (ending in 2015). Due to the
ownership structure of the Asian joint venture, and our partner’s rights to cause the dissolution and liquidation thereof at any time, it is not consolidated in our financial statements. Currently, the Asian joint venture does not own any
hotels. We act as the asset manager for two hotel properties in exchange for fees and we are seeking additional asset management opportunities in Asia.

Other Investments.

We own a leasehold interest in 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties and 18 Residence Inn by Marriott properties, which were sold to Hospitality
Properties Trust, Inc. (“HPT”) and leased back prior to 1997. In 1998, we subleased these 71 properties to a third party on similar terms with initial terms expiring between 2010 and 2012. The subleases are renewable at our option. Rent
payable under the subleases is guaranteed by the parent of the subtenants up to a maximum of approximately $21.6 million for the Courtyard leases, of which approximately $6.7 million has been funded through December 31, 2009, and
approximately $10.8 million for the Residence Inn leases, of which approximately $5.9 million has been funded through December 31, 2009. To the extent the parent of the subtenants fails to perform or fully funds its guarantee
obligation, we will be responsible for funding any rent shortfalls to HPT. At the expiration of these leases, HPT will return our initial security deposit of approximately $67 million, plus additional cash collateral of approximately
$7.8 million. We gave notice that we will terminate the lease on the 18 Residence Inn properties effective December 31, 2010, at which time we expect our $17 million security deposit will be returned by HPT. In 2010, we also intend to
give notice that we will terminate the lease on the 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties effective December 31, 2012.

We
own a 49% limited partner interest in Tiburon Golf Ventures, L.P., which owns the golf club surrounding The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort, Naples. For additional detail of our other real estate investments, including a summary of the outstanding debt
balances of our affiliates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Investments in Affiliates” and Note 3 “Investments in Affiliates” and Note 7 “Leases” in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

On September 11, 2009, we sold our remaining 3.6% limited
partnership interest in CBM Joint Venture Limited Partnership, which owned 115 Courtyard by Marriott properties (“CBM JV”) for approximately



$13 million and recorded a gain on property transactions of $5 million, net of taxes. As a result of this transaction, we no longer have any ownership interest in CBM JV.

Foreign Operations

Excluding hotels owned by our European joint venture, we currently own four properties in Canada, one in Mexico and two in Chile, which collectively contain approximately 2,500 rooms. Approximately 3% of our revenues were attributed to the
operations of these properties in each of 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Environmental and Regulatory Matters

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real
property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances. These laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic
substances. In addition, certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for
personal injury associated with exposure to released asbestos-containing materials. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require
corrective or other expenditures. In connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels, we may be potentially liable for various environmental costs or liabilities. Although we are currently not aware of any material
environmental claims pending or threatened against us, we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future.

Operational Agreements

All of our hotels are managed by third parties
pursuant to management agreements or operating and license agreements (See “Operating Structure”). As of February 17, 2010, twenty of our hotels that are operated by Starwood, our Embassy Suites Chicago Hotel, Downtown/Lakefront, our
San Francisco Marriott Fisherman’s Wharf and our Hilton Singer Island Oceanfront Resort are operated pursuant to operating and license agreements, while our remaining hotels are operated pursuant to management agreements, the provisions of
which are described in more detail below. Under these agreements, the managers or operators generally have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the day-to-day operation of the hotels, including establishing
all room rates, processing reservations, procuring inventories, supplies and services, providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers’ technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the
hotels. The manager or operator provides all managerial and other employees for the hotels, reviews the operation and maintenance of the hotels, prepares reports, budgets and projections, and provides other administrative and accounting support
services to the hotels. Generally, these support services include planning and policy services, financial planning, divisional financial services, product planning and development, employee staffing and training, corporate executive management and
certain in-house legal services. For the majority of our properties, we have approval rights over the budget, capital expenditures and other matters.

Management Agreements

.

Our management agreements typically include the terms described below:

•

Term and fees for operational services

.    The initial term of our management agreements generally is 15 to 20 years with
one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager. The manager receives compensation in the form of a base management fee, which is calculated as a percentage (typically 3%) of annual gross revenues, and an incentive management fee, which is
typically calculated as a percentage (generally 20%) of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel.



•

Chain services

.    The management agreements require the managers to furnish chain services that are generally furnished on
a centralized basis. Such services include: (1) the development and operation of certain computer systems and reservation services, (2) regional management and administrative services, regional marketing and sales services, regional
training services, manpower development and relocation of regional personnel and (3) such additional central or regional services as may from time to time be more efficiently performed on a regional or group basis rather than at an individual
hotel. Costs and expenses incurred in providing these services are generally allocated among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates that benefit from these services.

•

Working capital and fixed asset supplies

.    Our management agreements typically require us to maintain working capital for
each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies (for example, linen, china, glassware, silver and uniforms). We also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available
from hotel operations are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels.

•

Furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements

.    Under the management agreements, we are required to provide to the
managers all necessary furniture, fixtures and equipment for the operation of the hotels (including funding any required furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements). The management agreements generally provide that, on an annual basis, the
manager will prepare a list of furniture, fixtures and equipment to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the funds that are necessary, which is subject to our review and
approval. For purposes of funding the furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements, a specified percentage (typically 5%) of the gross revenues of the hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow account in our name, to which the manager has
access. However, for 61 of our hotels, we have entered into an agreement with Marriott International to allow us to fund such expenditures directly as incurred from one account that we control, subject to maintaining a minimum balance of the greater
of $33.5 million, or 30% of total annual specified contributions, rather than escrowing funds at accounts at each hotel.

•

Building alterations, improvements and renewals

.    The management agreements require the managers to prepare an annual
estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals and replacements to the structural, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and elevators of each hotel which we review
and approve based on their recommendations and our judgment. In addition to the foregoing, the management agreements generally provide that the manager may propose such changes, alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required, in the
manager’s reasonable judgment, to keep the hotel in a competitive, efficient and economical operating condition consistent with the manager’s brand standards. We generally have approval authority over such changes, alterations and
improvements.

•

Service marks

.    During the term of the management agreements, the brand name, service mark, symbols and logos used by the
manager may be used in the operation of the hotel. Any right to use the brand name, service marks, logos and symbols and related trademarks at a hotel will terminate with respect to that hotel upon termination of the applicable management or
franchise agreement.

•

Sale of the hotel.

Most of the management agreements limit our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the hotels by
requiring that the transferee assume the related management agreements and meet specified other conditions, including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager.

•

Termination on sale

.    While most of our management agreements are not terminable prior to their full term, we have
negotiated rights with respect to 18 specified Marriott-branded hotels to terminate management agreements in connection with the sale of these hotels subject to certain limitations, including the number of agreements that can be terminated per year,
limitations measured by EBITDA, and limitations requiring that a significant part of such hotels maintain the Marriott brand affiliation. The described termination rights may be exercised without payment of a termination fee, except for one of the
specified hotels wherein a termination fee is required if it does not maintain the Marriott brand affiliation.



•

Performance termination

.    The majority of our management agreements provide for termination rights in the case of a
manager’s prolonged failure to meet certain financial performance criteria, generally a set return on the owners’ investment. We have agreed in the past, and may agree in the future, to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange
for consideration from the hotel manager, which could take the form of cash compensation or amendments to the management agreement. Similarly, the majority of our management agreements condition the manager’s right to renew pre-determined
extension terms upon satisfaction of certain financial performance criteria.

Operating and License
Agreements.

Our operating and license agreements with Starwood (the operator with which we have the vast majority of these agreements) typically include the terms described below:

•

Term and fees for operational services

.    The initial term of our operating agreements is 20 years, with two renewal terms
of 10 years each at the option of the operator. The operator receives compensation in the form of a base fee of 1% of annual gross operating revenues and an incentive fee of 20% of annual gross operating profit, after the owner has received a
priority return of 10.75% on its purchase price and other investments in the hotels.

•

License services

.    The license agreements address matters relating to the subject brand, including rights to use service
marks, logos, symbols and trademarks, such as those associated with Westin

®

, Sheraton

®

and W

®

, as well as matters relating to compliance with certain standards and policies and (including through other agreements in the case of certain hotels) the provision of
certain system program and centralized services. The license agreements have an initial term of 20 years each, with two renewal terms of 10 years each at the option of the licensor. Licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees of 5% of
gross operating revenue attributable to room sales and 2% of gross operating revenue attributable to food and beverage sales.

•

Programs and services

.    The licensor or operator provides certain system programs and services to all or substantially all
of our Starwood hotels by brand in a licensed area. Such services include participation in reservation services and the marketing program as well as the Starwood Preferred Guest Program. In addition to these services, under the operating agreements,
centralized operating services are furnished to hotels by brand on a system basis. Costs and expenses incurred in providing such system programs and services and centralized operating services under the license and operating agreements or other
agreements are fairly allocated among all hotels in the applicable brand operated or licensed by Starwood or its affiliates.

•

Working capital and fixed asset supplies

.    The operating agreements require us to maintain working capital funds for each
hotel in order to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies and to meet the ongoing cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from hotel operations are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels. For
18 of our hotels, the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by Starwood operators for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis, with operators being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as
otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the operating agreements.

•

Furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements

.    Under the operating and license agreements, we are required to provide
all necessary furniture, fixtures and equipment for the operation of the hotels (including funding for any required furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements). To fund these items each month, the operator transfers into a reserve fund account
an amount equal to 5% of the gross operating revenue of a hotel for the previous month. For 18 of our hotels, the periodic reserve fund contributions which would otherwise be deposited into reserve fund accounts maintained by operators for each
hotel are distributed to us, and we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which would otherwise be funded from the reserve funds for each of the subject hotels as such expenditures become necessary. In addition to routine capital
expenditures, the reserve funds for the hotels also may be used for building capital improvements. Any approved reserve funding in excess of amounts



available in the pooled reserve funds is funded by us and results in appropriate increases of owner’s investment and owner’s priority amounts. For 18 hotels, the amount of any such
additional reserve funding will be allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis, determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all hotels for the most recent operating year. Any
such additional reserve funding will result in corresponding increases in the owner’s investment and owner’s priority amounts with respect to each of such hotels.

•

Building alterations, improvements and renewals

.    The operating agreements require the operators to prepare an annual
operating plan that includes an estimate of the expenditures necessary for maintenance, repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals and replacements to the structural, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and
elevators of each hotel, which plan and proposed expenditures we review and approve based on the operator’s recommendations and our judgment.

•

Territorial

.    The operating agreements provide area restrictions for a period of either five or 10 years, which limit the
operator and its affiliates from owning, operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand in the area. The area restrictions vary with each hotel, from city blocks in urban areas to up to a 10-mile radius from the hotel in other areas.

•

Sale of the hotel/other

.    The license agreements limit our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the hotels.
Generally, the agreements require that the transferee assume the related operating agreement and meet specified other conditions, including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the licensor. The operating agreements provide for
termination rights beginning in 2016 in the case of the operator’s failure to meet certain financial performance criteria. Generally, such rights arise in the event that the operator fails, for two consecutive years, to generate operating
profit equal to or greater than a specified percentage of the owner’s investment in the hotel, and the RevPAR performance of the hotel falls below that of other competitive hotels in the market during such two-year period.

•

Termination on sale

.    As of February 17, 2010, we have termination rights relating to the operating agreements on ten
specified hotels upon the sale of those hotels. Such termination rights are currently active with respect to one such hotel. With respect to nine of the ten specified hotels, we have the right beginning in 2016 to sell 35% of such hotels (measured
by EBITDA), not to exceed two hotels annually, free and clear of the existing operating agreement over a period of time without the payment of a termination fee. With respect to any termination of an operating agreement on sale, the proposed
purchaser would need to meet the requirements for transfer under the applicable license agreement.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we had 186 employees, including 177 at our Bethesda, Maryland office, two at our London,
England office, one at our Amsterdam, The Netherlands office and six at our Republic of Singapore office. Employees at our consolidated hotels are employed by the operators that manage our hotels.

None of our direct employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. However, employees at certain of our third-party managed
hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to review and renewal on a regular basis. For a discussion of these relationships see “Risk Factors—We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel
personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.”

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The
statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.



Forward Looking Statements

Our disclosure and analysis in this 2009 Form 10-K and in our 2009 Annual Report to shareholders contain some forward-looking statements that
set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public. Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of
future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify each such statement by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,”
“project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will,” “target,” “forecast” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In
particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future acquisitions or dispositions, future capital expenditure plans, future performance or results of current and anticipated expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or the
outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings.

We cannot guarantee that any future results discussed in any
forward-looking statements will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions, including those discussed in
the risk factors below. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should
bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make or related subjects in our reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K that we file with the SEC. Also note
that in the following risk factors we provide a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could cause our actual
results to differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all
such risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all of the potential risks or uncertainties that could affect our business.

Financial Risks and Risks of Operation

Current economic conditions have already
adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.

The current
weak economic environment, triggered by recent declines in GDP, business investment, corporate profits, consumer spending and continuing high levels of unemployment, has negatively impacted, and we believe will continue to negatively impact, overall
lodging demand. The performance of the lodging industry has historically been closely linked with the performance of the general economy. Trends affecting overall lodging demand were weak in 2009 and continue to impact our results of operations
(including our revenue and net income) and, we expect, will continue to be weak at least into the first half of 2010. We do not anticipate an improvement in lodging demand until the economy experiences sustained quarter-over-quarter growth. In
addition, declines in demand and in consumer and business spending have resulted in rate reductions at our hotels, which have had a negative impact on our gross profit. The general economic trends discussed above make it difficult to predict our
future operating results. We may experience further declines in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties beyond current expectations for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, greater than anticipated weakness in the economy,
changes in travel patterns and the continued impact of the trends identified above. Such reduced revenues or earnings also may reduce our working capital, impact our long-term business strategy, impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet
certain covenants in our existing debt agreements.



Current economic conditions have adversely effected the valuation of our hotels which may result in
further impairment charges on our properties.

We analyze our assets for impairment in several situations, including when a
property has current or projected losses from operations, when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when other material trends, contingencies or changes in circumstances
indicate that a triggering event has occurred that indicate an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. For impaired assets, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the property’s carrying value over its fair value. Our
operating results for 2009 included $131 million of impairment charges related to our consolidated hotels and our European joint venture. As a result of continued economic weakness, we may incur additional impairment charges, which will
negatively affect our results of operations. We can provide no assurance that any impairment loss recognized would not be material to our results of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies.”

Our revenues and the value of our properties are also subject to other conditions
affecting the lodging industry.

The lodging industry is subject to changes in the travel patterns of business and leisure
travelers, both of which are affected by the strength of the economy, as discussed above, as well as other factors. Changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term and
adversely affect our results. Our results of operations and any forecast we make, may be affected and can change based on the following risks:

•

changes in the international, national, regional and local economic climate;

•

changes in business and leisure travel patterns;

•

the effect of terrorist attacks and terror alerts in the United States and internationally, as well as other geopolitical disturbances;

•

supply growth in markets where we own hotels, which may adversely affect demand at our properties;

•

the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to our competition;

•

the performance of the managers of our hotels;

•

outbreaks of disease;

•

changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors; and

•

unionization of the labor force at our hotels.

Disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our business and results of operations, our ability to obtain financing on reasonable and acceptable terms, our ability to hedge our foreign
currency exchange risk and the market price of our common stock.

The United States and global stock and credit markets
have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, all of which have caused market prices of the stocks of many companies to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective and outstanding debt financings
to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, which made terms for certain financings materially less attractive, and, in some cases, resulted in the lack of availability of certain types of
financing. While conditions in the credit markets have improved since their initial disruption, continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional short-term and long-term financing on
reasonable terms or at all, which would negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition. A prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may negatively
impact our ability to enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These



disruptions in the financial markets also may adversely affect our credit rating and the market value of our common stock. While we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity with which to
meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, if our operating results worsen significantly and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates
increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be unable to access capital when necessary.

Unlike regular C corporations, we must finance our growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income (other than net capital
gain) in order to qualify as a REIT, including taxable income we recognize for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash. Our ability to access the external capital we require could be hampered by a number of
factors, many of which are outside of our control, including credit market conditions as discussed above, unfavorable market perception of our growth potential, decreases in our current and estimated future earnings, or decreases in the market price
of Host’s common stock. Our ability to access additional capital also may be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness, which, under certain circumstances, restrict our incurrence of debt and the payment of distributions. The occurrence
of any of these factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us or at all and the failure to obtain necessary external capital could have a
material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth.

We have substantial debt and may incur additional debt.

As of February 17, 2010, we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately $5.4 billion. Our
substantial indebtedness has important consequences in that it currently requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working
capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, dividends and other general corporate purposes. Additionally, it could:

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;

•

limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or obtain financing for expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general
corporate purposes on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all; or

•

affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions.

If our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness, we will have to raise
additional funds through:

•

sales of our equity;

•

the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by Host LP; or

•

the sale of our assets.

We cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or, if available, will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations
or fulfill our business plan.



The terms of our debt place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which reduce our operational
flexibility and create default risks.

The documents governing the terms of our existing senior notes and our credit
facility contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:

•

conduct acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, unless the successor entity in such transaction assumes our indebtedness;

•

incur additional debt in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics;

•

create liens securing indebtedness, unless an effective provision is made to secure our other indebtedness by such liens;

•

sell assets without using the proceeds from such sales for certain permitted uses or to make an offer to repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness;

•

make capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds;

•

pay dividends without satisfying certain financial metrics; and

•

conduct transactions with affiliates other than on an arms length basis and, in certain instances, without obtaining opinions as to the fairness of
such transactions.

Certain covenants in the credit facility also require us and our subsidiaries to meet
financial performance tests. If we fail to meet such tests, the restrictive covenants in the applicable indenture(s), the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt (including our mortgage debt) will reduce our flexibility in
conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could
result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt. For a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition”.

Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or prohibited by
the terms of our indebtedness or preferred stock.

We are, and may in the future become, party to agreements and
instruments that restrict or prevent the payment of dividends on our classes and series of capital stock. Under the terms of Host LP’s credit facility and senior notes indenture, distributions to Host by Host LP, upon which Host depends in
order to obtain the cash necessary to pay dividends, are permitted only to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, Host LP can satisfy certain financial covenant tests (concerning leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest
coverage) and meet other requirements.

Under the terms of our outstanding Class E Preferred Stock, we are not permitted to
pay dividends on our common stock unless all cumulative dividends have been paid (or funds for payment have been set aside for payment). The amount of aggregate dividends that accrue on the Class E Preferred Stock each quarter is approximately
$2.2 million. In the event that we fail to pay the accrued dividends on our Class E Preferred Stock for any reason, including any restriction on paying such dividends under the terms of our debt instruments (as discussed above), dividends will
continue to accrue on such preferred stock and we will be prohibited from paying any dividends on our common stock until all such accrued but unpaid dividends on our Class E Preferred Stock have been paid (or funds for such payment have been set
aside).

Defaulting on our mortgage debt could adversely affect our business.

As of February 17, 2010, 11 of our hotels and assets related thereto are subject to mortgages in an aggregate amount of approximately
$1.1 billion. Although the debt is generally non-recourse to us, if these hotels do not produce adequate cash flow to service the debt secured by such mortgages, the mortgage lenders could call a



default on these assets. Generally, we would expect to negotiate with the lender prior to the occurrence of a default to pursue other options, such as a deed in lieu of foreclosure. However, we
may opt to allow such default to occur rather than make the necessary mortgage payments with funds from other sources. Host LP’s senior notes indenture and credit facility contain cross-default provisions, which, depending upon the amount of
secured debt in default, could cause a cross-default under both of these agreements. Host LP’s credit facility, which contains a more restrictive cross-default provision than the senior notes indenture, provides that a credit facility default
will occur in the event that Host LP defaults on non-recourse secured indebtedness in excess of 1% (or approximately $150 million as of December 31, 2009) of its total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values). For this and
other reasons, permitting a default could adversely affect our long-term business prospects.

Our mortgage debt contains provisions that
may reduce our liquidity.

Certain of our mortgage debt requires that, to the extent cash flow from the hotels which secure
such debt drops below stated levels, we escrow cash flow after the payment of debt service until operations improve above the stated levels. In some cases, the lender has the right under certain circumstances to apply the escrowed amount to the
outstanding balance of the mortgage debt. If such provisions are triggered, there can be no assurance that the affected properties will achieve the minimum cash flow levels required to trigger a release of any escrowed funds. The amounts required to
be escrowed may be material and may negatively affect our liquidity by limiting our access to cash flow after debt service from these mortgaged properties.

An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on our credit facility and on any floating rate debt we incur and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell
assets.

Interest payments for borrowings on our credit facility, the mortgages on our Orlando World Center Marriott and JW
Marriott, Washington, D.C. properties and the floating interest rate swaps linked to our Newport Beach Marriott/Ritz-Carlton Naples mortgage are based on floating rates. To the extent that we draw on the credit facility, an increase in interest
rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes, including investments in our portfolio. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt
that is refinanced. We may from time to time enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts. While these agreements may lessen the impact of rising interest rates, they also expose us to the
risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our
ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy.

Rating agency downgrades may increase our cost of capital.

Our senior notes and our preferred stock are rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and
Fitch Ratings. These independent rating agencies may elect to downgrade their ratings on our senior notes and our preferred stock at any time. Such downgrades may negatively affect our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of capital.

Our expenses may not decrease if our revenue decreases.

Many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels, such as debt-service payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, are relatively inflexible and do not
necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the hotels. Our expenses also will be affected by inflationary increases, and certain costs, such as wages, benefits and insurance, may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period
and, in the event of a significant decrease in demand, we may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work-forces in order to decrease wages and benefits. Our managers may be unable to offset any such increased expenses with higher room rates. Any
of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties.



Our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity,
financial position and/or results of operations.

As part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire luxury and upper
upscale hotel properties. We may acquire properties through various structures, including transactions involving portfolios, single assets, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs or
similar real estate entities. We anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods, including proceeds from Host equity offerings, issuance of limited partnership interests of Host LP, advances under our credit
facility, the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sales of assets. Continued disruptions in credit markets may limit our ability to finance acquisitions and may limit the ability of purchasers to finance hotels and
adversely affect our disposition strategy and our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance acquisitions.

We may, from
time to time, be in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions and we expect to continue to do so in the future. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future
acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from the acquisitions that we consummate. Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms, or our failure to realize the intended benefits
from one or more acquisitions, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and
our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities.

We do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our
hotels.

Since federal income tax laws restrict REITs and their subsidiaries from operating or managing hotels, we do not
operate or manage our hotels. Instead, we lease substantially all of our hotels to subsidiaries which qualify as “taxable REIT subsidiaries” under applicable REIT laws, and our taxable REIT subsidiaries retain third-party managers to
operate our hotels pursuant to management agreements. Our cash flow from the hotels may be adversely affected if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name. While
our taxable REIT subsidiaries monitor the hotel managers’ performance, we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately. In addition, from time to time, we have had,
and continue to have, differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements. We generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations. However, if we
are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third-party dispute resolution. Failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our
management agreements could adversely affect our results of operations. Our hotel managers or their affiliates manage, and in some cases own, have invested in, or provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our
hotels, all of which may result in conflicts of interest. As a result, our hotel managers have in the past made, and may in the future make, decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest.

We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.

We have entered into management agreements with third-party managers to operate our hotel properties. Our third-party
managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. Although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels, we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the
hotel labor force, particularly those hotels with unionized labor. From time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity. We also may incur increased
legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes or other events. Additionally, hotels where our managers have collective bargaining agreements with employees (approximately 21% of our current portfolio, by revenues) are more
highly affected



by labor force activities than others. The resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, either by increases in wages or benefits or by
changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. Furthermore, labor agreements may limit the ability of our managers to reduce the size of hotel workforces during an economic downturn because collective bargaining agreements are negotiated
between the managers of our hotels and labor unions. We do not have the ability to control the outcome of these negotiations.

Our hotels
have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace, maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations. The timing and costs of such
renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments.

In addition to capital expenditures required by our loan agreements or agreements with our hotel managers, we will need to make capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels, to
maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance, particularly if the improvements require closures of a significant number of rooms or other
features of the hotels, such as ballrooms, meeting space and restaurants. These capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays. In addition, because we depend on external sources
of capital, we may not have the necessary funds to invest and, if we fail to maintain our properties in accordance with brand standards set by our managers, the manager may terminate the management agreement. Moreover, we may not necessarily realize
a significant, or any, improvement in the performance of the hotels in which we make these investments.

The ownership of hotels outside
the United States and the expansion of our business into new markets outside of the United States will expose us to risks relating to owning hotels in those international markets.

Part of our business strategy is to expand our presence internationally through joint ventures. We currently own directly seven hotels
located outside the United States and are a party to joint ventures that own 11 hotels in Europe. We also are a party to another joint venture through which we are exploring investment opportunities throughout Asia and Australia. We may have
difficulty managing our expansion into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy, an absence of business relationships in the area, or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting
procedures and regulations. There are risks inherent in conducting business internationally, which include:

•

employment laws and practices;

•

tax laws which may provide for income or other tax rates that exceed those of the U.S. and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to
dividend withholding requirements or other restrictions;

•

compliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy;

•

the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability, cost and terms of such financing;

•

adverse changes in local, political, economic and market conditions;

•

insurance coverage related to terrorist events;

•

changes in interest rates and/or the currency exchange rates;

•

regulations regarding the incurrence of debts; and

•

difficulties in complying with U.S. rules governing REITs while operating internationally.

Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international expansion. If we do not
effectively manage our geographic expansion and successfully integrate the foreign hotels into our organization, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.



We may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts.

We have made a significant investment in a European joint venture which owns 11 hotels in Europe and have formed another
joint venture to explore investment opportunities in Asia and Australia. We may, from time to time, invest as a co-venturer in other entities holding hotel properties instead of purchasing hotel properties directly. Co-venturers often share control
over the operation of a joint venture. Actions by a co-venturer could subject the assets to additional risk as a result of any of the following circumstances:

•

our co-venturer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our, or the joint venture’s, interests or goals; or

•

our co-venturer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives.

Although we generally will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture in order to permit our
objectives to be achieved, we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners.

Our management
agreements could affect the sale or financing of our hotels.

Under the terms of our management agreements, we generally may
not sell, lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions. Our ability to finance or sell our
properties, depending upon the structure of such transactions, may require the manager’s consent. If the manager does not consent to such sale or financing, we may be precluded from taking actions in our best interest.

Future terrorist attacks or changes in terror alert levels could adversely affect us.

Previous terrorist attacks in the United States and subsequent terrorist alerts have adversely affected the travel and hospitality industries
over the past several years. The impact that terrorist attacks in the United States or elsewhere could have on domestic and international markets and our business in particular is indeterminable, but it is possible that such attacks or the threat of
such attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to finance our business, our ability to insure our properties and/or our results of operations and financial condition as a whole.

We may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts, and federal terrorism
legislation does not ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future.

We obtain terrorism insurance as part of our all-risk property insurance program, as well as our general liability and directors’ and officers’ coverage. However, our all-risk policies have
limitations, such as per occurrence limits, annual aggregate coverage limits and sublimits, all of which might have to be shared proportionally across participating hotels under certain loss scenarios. Also, all-risk insurers only have to provide
terrorism coverage to the extent mandated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (“TRIPRA”). Property damage related to war and to nuclear, radiological, biological and chemical incidents is excluded under our
policies. While TRIPRA will reimburse insurers for losses resulting from nuclear, radiological, biological and chemical perils, TRIPRA does not require insurers to offer coverage for these perils and, to date, insurers are not willing to provide
this coverage, even with government reinsurance. Host has a wholly-owned captive insurance company through which it obtains a policy of nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) coverage. This captive insurer has the same
ability as other insurance companies to apply to the U.S. Treasury for reimbursement, as provided for in TRIPRA, and is subject to the same deductibles and co-insurance obligations. This potential reimbursement applies to property insurance only,
and not to general liability or directors’ and officers’ insurance, and there are no assurances that we will be able to recover any or all of our NCBR losses under this program.



We may be unable to satisfy the insurance requirements of our lenders.

Certain of our mortgage debt agreements for our properties and properties held by our European joint venture require us to maintain property
insurance provided by carriers maintaining minimum ratings from Standard & Poor’s, A.M. Best or other rating agencies. Several of our mortgages contain requirements for the financial strength of insurers to be rated as high as AA by
Standard & Poor’s. Due to upheavals in the financial markets, the number of insurers that carry that rating has been decreasing for a number of years. In prior years, we have still been able to satisfy these requirements through the
use of a fronting policy or credit wrap from an AA-rated insurer for a reasonable cost. With the stress in the financial markets, these arrangements have become scarce and expensive, and we are working with our lenders with respect to several
mortgage loans in order to modify their financial strength requirements. In 2009, in all cases where our insurance carriers did not meet the minimum financial strength requirements, we were able to obtain waivers from the lenders or they have
provided written assurances that they are satisfied with the makeup of our pool of insurance providers and thereby avoided the costs of obtaining a credit wrap. We cannot provide assurances that each of our lenders will continue to be satisfied with
our insurance coverage, or with the rating levels of our carriers, or that our carriers will not be downgraded further. If any of these lenders becomes dissatisfied with our insurance coverage or the ratings of our insurance carriers, they may, on
our behalf, elect to procure additional property insurance coverage that meets their ratings requirements. The cost of such additional property insurance would be borne by the property or properties securing the loans. Also, the premiums associated
with such coverage may be considerably higher than those associated with our current insurance coverage.

Some potential losses are not
covered by insurance.

We, or our hotel managers, carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property,
business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties. These policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties. Generally, our
“all-risk” property policies provide coverage that is available on a per-occurrence basis and that, for each occurrence, has an overall limit, as well as various sub-limits, on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive. Sub-limits
exist for certain types of claims, such as service interruption, debris removal, expediting costs, landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes. The dollar amounts of these sub-limits are significantly lower than
the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit. In this regard, hotels in certain of our markets, including California and Florida, have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from earthquakes and hurricanes.
Recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income. There is no assurance that this insurance, where maintained, will fully fund the re-building or restoration of a
hotel that is impacted by an earthquake, hurricane, or other natural disaster, or the income lost as a result of the damage. Our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable
event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub-limits contained in our policies have been exceeded and, in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage, any such claims will
be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the manager’s program for the same purpose. Therefore, if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels, or, in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by
the management company, affects hotels owned by others, the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. Each affected hotel may
only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available. We may incur losses in excess of insured limits and, as a result, we may be
even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or certain types of terrorism.

In addition, there are other risks, such as certain environmental hazards, that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive
to justify coverage. We also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy. Should a loss in excess of insured limits or an



uninsured loss occur, or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier, we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the
anticipated future revenue from the hotel. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property.

Finally, the current disruption in financial markets makes it more difficult to evaluate the stability and net assets or capitalization of
insurance companies and any insurer’s ability to meet its claim payment obligations.

Litigation judgments or settlements could have a
significant adverse effect on our financial condition.

We are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course
of business. We are vigorously defending each of these claims. On February 8, 2010, we received an adverse jury verdict in a trial in the 166th Judicial District Court of Bexar County, Texas involving the sale of land encumbered by a ground
lease for the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter. See “Legal Proceedings” for more information on the verdict and see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Other Income
Statement Line Items” for a discussion of the fourth quarter 2009 litigation accrual. There are no other claims seeking relief that, if granted, would have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We could,
however, become the subject of claims by the operators of our hotels, individuals or companies who use our hotels, our investors, our joint venture partners or regulating entities, which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial
condition and performance.

We may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to hotels or businesses we acquire.

Assets and entities that we have acquired, or may in the future acquire, may be subject to unknown or contingent
liabilities for which we may have no recourse, or only limited recourse, against the sellers. In general, the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such
liabilities and seek recourse against our sellers. While we usually require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive, such indemnification is often limited and subject to various materiality
thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses. As a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties. The total amount
of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations, plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects, all of which may adversely affect our
revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition. Finally, indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired
by us. While the sellers are generally contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations, materiality thresholds, deductibles or caps on losses, there can be no
guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses as well.

We depend on our key
personnel.

Our success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. None of our key personnel
have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers. We cannot assure you that these key personnel will remain employed by us. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key
personnel, the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance.

Exchange rate fluctuations
could adversely affect our financial results.

As a result of the expansion of our international operations, currency
exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position. We expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso, the
British Pound, the



Polish Zloty and the Chilean Peso. Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and
other foreign currencies, these hedging transactions, if entered into, will not eliminate that risk entirely. To the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate
fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies, the
conversion of those results into U.S. Dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of those revenues or earnings.

Applicable REIT laws may restrict certain business activities.

As a REIT, Host is subject to various
restrictions on its income, assets and activities. Business activities that could be impacted by applicable REIT laws include, but are not limited to, activities such as developing alternative uses of real estate, including the development and/or
sale of timeshare or condominium units. Due to these restrictions, we anticipate that we will conduct certain business activities, including those mentioned above, in one or more of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries are
taxable as regular C corporations and are subject to federal, state, local, and, if applicable, foreign taxation on their taxable income.

We may be unable to sell properties because real estate investments are inherently illiquid.

Real estate
properties generally cannot be sold quickly and, accordingly, we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. The inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could
adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to service our debt. In addition, under the federal income tax laws applicable to REITs, we may be limited in our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets.

Our ground lease payments may increase faster than the revenues we receive on the hotels situated on the leased properties.

As of December 31, 2009, 35 of our hotels are subject to third-party ground leases (encumbering all or a portion of
the hotel). These ground leases generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments, which payments are often based on economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index. Our ability to pay ground rent could be adversely affected to the
extent that our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases. In addition, if we were to sell a hotel encumbered by a ground lease, the buyer would have to assume the
ground lease, which may result in a lower sales price.

Environmental problems are possible and can be costly.

We believe that our properties comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws. Unidentified environmental liabilities
could arise, however, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or
operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property. The owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation
and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants.
Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a
site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing
asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during
renovation or demolition of a



building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or
operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.

Compliance with other government regulations can be costly.

Our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act,
building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety. Compliance with those laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. These regulations may be changed from time-to-time, or new regulations adopted, resulting
in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. Any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The acquisition contracts relating to some hotels limit our ability to sell or refinance those hotels.

For reasons relating to federal and state income tax considerations of the former and current owners of three hotels, we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels, or repaying or refinancing the
mortgage debt for varying periods, depending on the hotel. Two of these agreements will expire in 2010 and the third will expire in 2028. As a result, even if it were in our best interest to sell these hotels or repay or otherwise reduce the level
of the mortgage debt on such hotels, it may be difficult or costly to do so during their respective lock-out periods. In specified circumstances, we may agree to similar restrictions in connection with future hotel acquisitions.

Risks of Ownership of Host’s Common Stock

There are limitations on the acquisition of Host common stock and changes in control.

Host’s charter and
bylaws, the partnership agreement of Host LP, and the Maryland General Corporation Law contain a number of provisions, the exercise or existence of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium
price for our stockholders or Host LP unit holders or otherwise be in their best interests, including the following:

•

Restrictions on transfer and ownership of Host’s stock.

To maintain Host’s qualification as a REIT for federal
income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of Host’s outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned in the last half of the taxable year, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, which, as defined in the Internal Revenue
Code (the “Code”), may include certain entities. Because such ownership could jeopardize Host’s qualification as a REIT, a person cannot own, directly or by attribution, 10% or more of an interest in a Host lessee, nor can a Host
lessee of any partnership in which Host is a partner own, directly or by attribution, 10% or more of Host’s shares, in each case unless exempted by Host’s Board of Directors.

Host’s charter prohibits ownership, directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, by any person or persons acting as
a group, of more than 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of shares of Host’s outstanding common stock, preferred stock or any other stock, each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose. Together, these
limitations are referred to as the “ownership limit.”

Stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit
will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the intended acquiror of the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon, to vote those shares
of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares of Host’s stock to a person who, as a result of the
transfer, violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances, and, in any event, would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of Host’s stock in excess of the ownership limit. These restrictions on
transfer and ownership will not apply if Host’s Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with the restrictions on transfer is no longer required for Host to
qualify as a REIT.



•

Removal of Board of Directors.

Host’s charter provides that, except for any directors who may be elected by holders
of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than common stock, directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of
directors. Vacancies on Host’s Board of Directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of the remaining directors (except that a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire Board
of Directors) and, in the case of a vacancy resulting from the removal of a director, by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.

•

Preferred shares; classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder
approval.

Host’s charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that we have authority to issue is 1,100,000,000, consisting of 1,050,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of
preferred stock. Host’s Board of Directors has the authority, without a vote of stockholders, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock, including common stock into preferred stock or vice versa, and to establish the preferences
and rights of any preferred or other class or series of shares to be issued. Because the Board of Directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of additional classes or series of stock without a stockholder vote, Host’s Board
of Directors may give the holders of any class or series of stock preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of existing stock.

•

Maryland business combination law.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, specified “business
combinations,” including specified issuances of equity securities, between a Maryland corporation and any person who owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation’s then outstanding shares, or an affiliate or associate of the
corporation who, at any time during the two year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the corporation (each, an “interested stockholder”), or an
affiliate of the interested stockholder, are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Thereafter, any of these specified business combinations must be approved by 80%
of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding voting shares and by two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of voting shares other than voting shares held by the interested stockholder unless, among other
conditions, the corporation’s common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined in the Maryland General Corporation Law, for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested
stockholder. As a Maryland corporation, Host is subject to the Maryland business combination statute. The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors before the
time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. The Board of Directors has not granted any such exceptions at this time.

•

Maryland control share acquisition law.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, “control shares” acquired
in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquiror, by officers or by
directors who are employees of the corporation. “Control shares” are voting shares which, if aggregated with all other voting shares owned by the acquiror or over which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting
power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power: (1) one-tenth or more but less than one-third,
(2) one-third or more but less than a majority or (3) a majority or more of the voting power. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder
approval. A “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares, subject to specified exceptions. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law. There
can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.



•

Merger, consolidation, share exchange and transfer of Host’s assets.

Under Maryland law and Host’s charter,
subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock, we can merge with or into another entity, consolidate with one or more other entities, participate in a share exchange or transfer Host’s assets within the meaning of the
Maryland General Corporation Law if approved (1) by Host’s Board of Directors in the manner provided in the Maryland General Corporation Law and (2) by Host’s stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast
on the matter, except that any merger of Host with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing Host’s form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires only the approval of Host’s stockholders holding a majority of all
votes entitled to be cast on the merger. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange is only required to be approved by a Maryland corporation by its board of
directors if the corporation is the successor entity. Host’s voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.

•

Certain charter and bylaw amendments.

Host’s charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and
ownership of Host’s stock, fixing the size of the Board of Directors within the range set forth in the charter, removal of directors, the filling of vacancies, exculpation and indemnification of directors, calling special stockholder meetings
and others, all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by Host’s stockholders holding two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Other charter amendments generally require
approval of the Board and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. As permitted under the Maryland General Corporation Law, Host’s bylaws provide that directors have the exclusive right to
amend Host’s bylaws. These provisions may make it more difficult to amend Host’s charter and bylaws to alter the provisions described herein that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of Host
common stock, without the approval of the Board of Directors.

Shares of Host’s common stock that are or become
available for sale could affect the share price of Host’s common stock.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of
Host’s common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for Host’s common stock. In addition, holders of units of limited partnership interest of Host LP, whose OP units may be
redeemed, at Host’s election, in exchange for common stock, will be able to sell those shares freely, unless the person is our affiliate and resale of the affiliate’s shares is not covered by an effective registration statement. As of
December 31, 2009, there are approximately 11.7 million OP units outstanding that are redeemable, at Host’s election, for Host common stock. Further, a substantial number of shares of Host’s common stock have been and will be
issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans. We maintain two stock based compensation plans: the comprehensive stock plan, whereby we may award to participating employees and directors (i) restricted
shares of common stock, (ii) options to purchase common stock and (iii) deferred shares of common stock, and an employee stock purchase plan. At December 31, 2009, there were approximately 19.2 million shares of common stock
reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan, and there were 5.7 million shares of restricted stock outstanding and 0.5 million options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $5.46 per share.

Also as of December 31, 2009, Host LP has outstanding $1,251 million principal amount of exchangeable senior
debentures that could become exchangeable under certain conditions for shares of Host common stock. The principal portion for $526 million face amount of such exchangeable debentures is cash-settled, and therefore no shares would be issued
unless our share price exceeded the exchange rate for this series of debentures of $31.23 as of December 31, 2009. For another $400 million of such exchangeable debentures, Host has the option to issue cash, shares of Host common stock or
any combination thereof in settlement of the debentures should they be presented for exchange.



In August 2009, Host entered into a Sales Agency Financing Agreement with BNY Mellon Capital
Markets, LLC, through which Host may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $400 million in “at the market” offerings. As of December 31, 2009, 28 million shares of
common stock have been issued and sold pursuant to the program, and shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of approximately $110 million remain issuable from time to time under the agreement. Any additional shares of common
stock issued by Host, whether issued under this program or otherwise, would be available in the future for sale in the public markets. We can make no prediction about the effect that future sales of common stock would have on the market price of
Host common stock.

Our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of Host’s common stock.

We believe that the market value of a REIT’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the
REIT’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, whether from operations, sales, acquisitions, development or refinancings, and is secondarily based upon the value of the underlying assets. For that reason,
shares of Host’s common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes rather than
distributing the cash flow to stockholders, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may negatively impact the market price of Host’s common stock. Our failure to meet the market’s expectation with regard
to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of Host’s common stock.

Market interest
rates may affect the price of shares of Host’s common stock.

We believe that one of the factors that investors
consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a REIT is the dividend rate on the shares, considered as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective
purchasers of REIT shares may expect a higher dividend rate. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of Host’s stock to decrease.

Federal Income Tax Risks

To qualify as a REIT, each of Host and its subsidiary REITs
are required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, regardless of available cash or outstanding obligations.

To continue to qualify as a REIT, Host is required to distribute to its stockholders with respect to each year at least 90% of our taxable income, excluding net capital gain. To the extent that we satisfy
this distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income and net capital gain for the taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain. In
addition, we will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions made by us with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income and 95% of our net capital gain for that
year and any undistributed taxable income from prior years less excess distributions from prior years. We intend to make distributions, subject to the availability of cash and in compliance with any debt covenants, to our stockholders in order to
comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid the imposition of a significant nondeductible 4% excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from Host LP and its subsidiaries. There are differences in timing between our
recognition of taxable income and our receipt of cash available for distribution due to, among other things, the seasonality of the lodging industry and the fact that some taxable income will be “phantom” income, which is taxable income
that is not matched by cash flow. Due to transactions entered into in years prior to Host’s conversion to a REIT, Host could recognize substantial amounts of “phantom” income in the future. It is possible that these differences
between taxable income and the receipt of related cash could require us to borrow funds or to issue additional equity to enable Host to meet the distribution requirement and, therefore, to maintain our REIT status, and to avoid the nondeductible 4%
excise tax. In addition, because the REIT distribution requirement prevents Host from retaining earnings, we generally will be required to refinance debt at its maturity with additional debt or equity. It is possible that any of these sources of
funds, if available at all, would not be sufficient to meet Host’s distribution and tax obligations.



Host owns, through Host LP, 100% of the outstanding common stock (and a portion of the
outstanding preferred stock) of two entities that have elected to be treated as REITs. Each of these subsidiary REITs of Host will be subject to the same requirements that Host must satisfy in order to qualify as a REIT, including the distribution
requirements described above.

Adverse tax consequences would apply if Host or any of its subsidiary REITs fail to qualify as a REIT.

We believe that Host has been organized and has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a REIT under the Code,
commencing with our taxable year beginning January 1, 1999, and Host currently intends to continue to operate as a REIT during future years. In addition, Host owns, through Host LP, two entities as of December 31, 2009, that have elected
to be treated as REITs. As the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a REIT are limited, no assurance can be provided
that Host currently qualifies as a REIT or will continue to qualify as a REIT or that each of Host’s subsidiary REITs qualify as a REIT. If any of the subsidiary REITs were to fail to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that Host would fail to
qualify as a REIT unless we (or the subsidiary REIT) could avail ourselves (itself) of certain relief provisions. New legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with
respect to an entity’s qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of its REIT qualification. If Host or any of the subsidiary REITs were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and any available relief provisions did not apply, the
non-qualifying REIT would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax,
on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. Moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying REIT would not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification was lost.

Any determination that Host or one of its subsidiary REITs does not qualify as a REIT would have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and could materially reduce the value of our common stock. The additional tax liability of Host or the subsidiary REIT for the year, or years, in which the relevant entity did not qualify as a REIT would reduce its net earnings
available for investment, debt service or distributions to stockholders. Furthermore, the non-qualifying entity would no longer be required to make any distributions to stockholders as a condition to REIT qualification and all of its distributions
to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary C corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that if Host were to fail to qualify as a REIT, Host’s stockholders currently taxed as
individuals would be taxed on those dividends at capital gain rates and our corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject in each case to applicable limitations under
the Code. Host’s failure to qualify as a REIT also would cause an event of default under Host LP’s credit facility that could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due under the credit facility, which, in turn, would constitute an event
of default under Host LP’s outstanding debt securities.

If our leases are not respected as true leases for federal income tax
purposes, each of Host and its subsidiary REITs would fail to qualify as a REIT.

To qualify as a REIT, Host must satisfy
two gross income tests, pursuant to which specified percentages of our gross income must be passive income, such as rent. For the rent paid pursuant to the hotel leases with our TRS subsidiaries, which currently constitutes substantially all of
Host’s and each of our subsidiary REITs’ gross income, to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as service contracts, joint
ventures or some other type of arrangement. We believe that the leases will be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will agree with this characterization. If the leases were not
respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes, neither Host nor any of our subsidiary REITs would be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs and each would likely lose its REIT status.



If our affiliated lessees fail to qualify as taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of Host and its subsidiary
REITs would fail to qualify as a REIT.

Rent paid by a lessee that is a “related party tenant” of Host will not
be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs. We lease substantially all of our hotels to our subsidiary that is taxable as a regular C corporation and that has elected to be treated as a taxable REIT
subsidiary with respect to Host. So long as any affiliated lessee qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary, it will not be treated as a “related party tenant.” We believe that our affiliated lessees have qualified and will continue to
qualify, and that the taxable REIT subsidiaries of our subsidiary REITs have qualified and will continue to qualify, to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will
not challenge the status of a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in disqualifying any of our affiliated lessees (including the taxable REIT
subsidiaries of our subsidiary REITs) from treatment as a taxable REIT subsidiary, it is possible that Host or a subsidiary REIT would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to REITs and substantially all of its income would fail to qualify for the
gross income tests. If Host or a subsidiary REIT failed to meet either the asset or gross income tests, each would likely lose its REIT status.

Despite the REIT status of each of Host and its subsidiary REITs, we remain subject to various taxes.

One of
Host’s subsidiary REITs will be required to pay federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate on “built-in gain” recognized as a result of any sale of a hotel asset before the expiration of the applicable 10-year holding
period of assets, including certain hotels acquired from Starwood and its affiliates in 2006. The total amount of gain on which the subsidiary REIT would be subject to corporate income tax if all of its built-in gain assets were sold in a taxable
transaction prior to the expiration of the applicable 10-year holding period would be material to it. In addition, we expect that we could recognize other substantial deferred tax liabilities in the future without any corresponding receipt of cash.

Notwithstanding its status as a REIT, Host and our subsidiaries (including our subsidiary REITs) will be subject to some
federal, state, local and foreign taxes on their income and property. For example, Host and our subsidiary REITs will pay tax on certain types of income that are not distributed and will be subject to a 100% excise tax on transactions with a taxable
REIT subsidiary that are not conducted on an arm’s length basis. Moreover, the taxable REIT subsidiaries of Host and our subsidiary REITs are taxable as regular C corporations and will pay federal, state and local income tax on their net income
at the applicable corporate rates, and foreign taxes to the extent they own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions.

Host LP is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes (and any related interest and penalties) incurred by Host.

If the IRS were to challenge successfully Host LP’s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, Host would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.

We believe that Host LP qualifies to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, it is not subject to
federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including Host, is required to pay tax on such partner’s allocable share of its income. No assurance can be provided, however, that the IRS will not challenge Host LP’s
status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating Host LP as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, Host would fail to meet the gross income
tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, cease to qualify as a REIT. If Host LP fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or Host fails to qualify as a REIT, either failure would cause an
event of default under Host LP’s credit facility that, in turn, could constitute an event of default under Host LP’s outstanding debt securities. Also, the failure of Host LP to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes
would cause it to become subject to federal, state and foreign corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including Host.



As a REIT, each of Host and its subsidiary REITs is subject to limitations on its ownership of debt and
equity securities.

Subject to certain exceptions, a REIT is generally prohibited from owning securities in any one issuer
to the extent that (1) the value of those securities exceeds 5% of the value of the REIT’s total assets, (2) the securities owned by the REIT represent more than 10% of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities, or (3) the
REIT owns more than 10% of the value of the issuer’s outstanding securities. A REIT is permitted to own securities of a subsidiary in an amount that exceeds the 5% value test and the 10% vote or value test if the subsidiary elects to be a
taxable REIT subsidiary. However, a REIT may not own securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 25% of the value of the REIT’s total assets. If Host or any of its subsidiary REITs were to violate these
ownership limitations, each would likely lose its REIT status.

Each of Host or its subsidiary REITs may be required to pay a penalty tax
upon the sale of a hotel.

The federal income tax provisions applicable to REITs provide that any gain realized by a REIT
on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a “prohibited transaction” that is subject to a 100% excise tax. Under existing
law, whether property, including hotels, is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular
transaction. We intend to hold our hotels for investment with a view to long-term appreciation, to engage in the business of acquiring and owning hotels and to make occasional sales of hotels consistent with our investment objectives. There can be
no assurance, however, that the IRS might not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the 100% excise tax.

Legal Proceedings

On
February 8, 2010, we received an adverse jury verdict in a trial in the 166th Judicial District Court of Bexar County, Texas involving the sale of land encumbered by a ground lease for the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter. The jury found that
we tortiously interfered with the attempted sale by Keystone-Texas Property Holding Corporation of the land under the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter and awarded Keystone $34.3 million in damages plus statutory interest. In addition, the jury
found that we slandered Keystone’s title to the property and awarded Keystone $39 million in damages plus statutory interest. Keystone would be entitled to elect only one damage award. On February 12, 2010, the jury awarded
Keystone $7.5 million in exemplary damages with respect to the second claim. The verdict is not yet final and is subject to post-trial motions. Based on the range of possible outcomes, we accrued an additional potential litigation loss of
approximately $41 million in the fourth quarter consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.

We initiated the
suit against Keystone on April 27, 2005, seeking a declaration that a provision of the ground lease for the property under the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter was valid and claiming that Keystone had breached that lease provision. On
October 18, 2006, Keystone filed an amended counterclaim and later, a third party claim, alleging that we had tortiously interfered with Keystone’s attempted sale of the property and that we slandered Keystone’s title to the property.
We believe that a number of legal rulings decided by the trial court were in error and had an adverse effect on the jury’s verdict. We intend to vigorously pursue these issues in post trial motions and, if necessary, on appeal.



We are also involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business and
are vigorously defending these claims; however, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. We believe the final resolution of any of these other claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition.

Market for Registrant’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol “HST.” The following table sets forth, for
the fiscal periods indicated, the high and low closing sales prices per share of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and dividends declared per share:

*

In reliance on the specific terms of guidance issued by the IRS and subject to certain elections by our stockholders and the effect of a 10% cash limitation, Host paid
approximately 90% of the special dividend with Host common stock, or 13.4 million common shares, with the remaining 10% paid in cash of approximately $15.6 million.

Under the terms of our senior notes indenture and the credit facility, our ability to pay dividends and make other payments is dependent on
our ability to satisfy certain financial requirements. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition” and “Risk Factors—Financial Risks and Risks of
Operation—Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness or preferred stock.”

As of February 22, 2010, there were 30,316 holders of record of our common stock. However, because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we believe that there are
considerably more beneficial holders of our common stock than record holders. As of February 22, 2010, there were 1,965 holders of OP units (in addition to Host). OP units are redeemable for cash, or, at our election, convertible into Host
common stock.

Our ability to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code is facilitated by limiting the number of
shares of our stock that a person may own. Our charter provides that, subject to limited exceptions, no person or persons acting as a group may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, more than
9.8% in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive, of shares of Host’s outstanding common stock, preferred stock or any other stock, each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose. The Board of Directors has the
authority to increase the ownership limit from time to time, but does not have the authority to do so to the extent that after giving effect to such increase, any five beneficial owners of capital stock could beneficially own in the aggregate more
than 49.5% of the outstanding capital stock. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Ownership of Host’s Common Stock—There are limitations on the acquisition of Host common stock and changes in control.”

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in
this report.

Overview

As of February 17, 2010, we own 110 luxury and upper-upscale hotel properties and we are the largest lodging REIT in the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s composite index. A
REIT is a legal entity that owns real estate assets and, through payments of dividends to stockholders, is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level. Host operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT and
owns approximately 98% of the partnership interests of Host LP.

Our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the
most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. The majority of our properties are luxury and upper-scale that are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations that benefit
from significant barriers to entry by competitors. In 2009, approximately 77% of our revenues were generated by our urban and resort/conference hotels. While our hotels are still subject to competitive pressures, we believe this strategy should
allow us to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums in excess of those of our competitors. We seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management by assisting the managers of our hotels in optimizing property operations
and by completing strategic capital improvements.

Our Customers

The majority of our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business, and contract business, which accounted for
approximately 56%, 37% and 7%, respectively, of our 2009 room sales. Similar to the majority of the lodging industry, we further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows:

Transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers. Business travelers make up the majority of transient demand
at our hotels. Therefore, we will be more significantly affected by trends in business travel versus leisure demand. The four key subcategories of the transient business group are:

•

Premium: Sometimes referred to as “rack rate,” this rate is typically applied to rooms booked close to arrival during high demand periods and
is the highest rate category available. Room rates will fluctuate depending on anticipated demand levels (e.g. seasonality, weekday vs. weekend stays).

•

Corporate: This is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public. It is typically the second highest category, and is for
travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discount rates.

•

Special Corporate: This is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel
or to hotel brands generally. These rates are typically negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated corporate rate.

•

Discount: This encompasses all discount programs, such as AAA and AARP discounts, government per diem, rooms booked through wholesale channels,
frequent guest program redemptions, and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel.



Group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together, usually with a minimum of
10 rooms. Examples include a company training session or a social event such as a family reunion. The three key sub-categories of the group business category are:

•

Association: group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions.

•

Corporate: group business related to corporate meetings (e.g., product launches, training programs, contract negotiations, and presentations).

•

Other: group business predominately related to social, military, education, religious, fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams, otherwise known as
SMERF business.

The final category is contract demand, which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific
company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates. Contract rates are usually utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand. Airline crews are typical generators of
contract demand for our hotels.

Understanding Our Performance

Our Revenues and Expenses.

Our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements
under which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay
wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each four-week or monthly accounting period, which reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses
(excluding depreciation).

Hotel revenue is approximately 97% of our total revenue. The following table presents the
components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue:



Hotel operating expenses are approximately 98% of our total operating costs and expenses.
The following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses:

The expense
components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. It is also worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items, however, taken separately these costs represent approximately
55% of our hotel operating expenses.

Key Performance Indicators.

Revenue per available
room, or RevPAR, is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include food and
beverage or parking, telephone or other guest service revenues generated by the property. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels.

RevPAR changes that are driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental
operating profit than do changes that are driven predominately by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage, as well as additional
incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, would not result in additional room-related costs. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by increases or
decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels.

In
discussing our operating results, we present RevPAR and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis. Comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the



reporting periods being compared. Comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold, or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage, large
scale capital improvements or significant events during these periods.

We also evaluate the performance of our business
through non-GAAP financial measures, including funds from operations (“FFO”) per diluted share and comparable hotel adjusted operating profit. We use FFO per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company-wide profitability. Another
key profitability indicator we use is hotel adjusted operating profit, which is a non-GAAP measure used to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels. Hotel adjusted operating profit measures property-level results before debt service and
is a supplemental measure of individual property-level profitability. The comparable hotel adjusted operating profit that we discuss is an aggregation of the adjusted operating profit for each of our comparable hotels. Each of the non-GAAP measures
should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit and earnings per share. We provide a more detailed discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, how management uses
such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance as well as certain limitations of such measures. See “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Summary of 2009 Operating Results

During 2009, the economic recession,
both domestically and internationally, and the continued fall-out from the collapse of the credit markets in 2008 contributed to a significant decrease in GDP, corporate profits and business and consumer spending, as well as a significant increase
in the unemployment rate. These factors combined to depress overall lodging demand, which resulted in historical levels of decline in occupancy and average room rates. In addition to these economic drivers, political pressure and public relations
concerns over corporate travel further diminished booking activity and reduced attendance at group events, resulting in lower banquet, food and beverage and other revenues. Meeting planners were able to take advantage of historically high room
availability, which has resulted in a shift in pricing power, leading to lower average room rates. Overall, comparable RevPAR decreased 19.9% in 2009 as a result of a decrease in occupancy of 5.4 percentage points and a decrease of 13.5% in average
room rate with a similar decline in food and beverage revenues of 20.4%. As a result, total revenue decreased $981 million, or 19.1%, to approximately $4.2 billion for the year.

Net income declined $672 million in 2009 to a loss of $258 million. The decline in net income primarily reflects the decline in
operating profit due to the decrease in overall lodging demand described above. The net loss also reflects $131 million of impairment charges incurred during 2009, $31 million of which are included in discontinued operations. Diluted
earnings per common share decreased $1.17 to a $.45 loss in 2009. FFO per diluted share decreased $1.20, to $.51, for 2009. The declines in diluted earnings per common share and FFO per diluted share reflect the decline in operations and the
issuance of approximately 104 million common shares throughout the year. The declines in earnings and FFO per share during 2009 also reflect $131 million of impairment charges and an expense accrual of approximately $41 million
related to a potential litigation loss. During 2008, impairment charges totaled $3 million.

Management was able to
partially mitigate the decline in our operations by working with our managers to minimize margin deterioration. During the year, we worked with our operators to implement significant contingency plans, which included right-sizing the work force to
the amount of business being generated, reducing discretionary spending, delaying the implementation of brand standards, closing restaurant outlets or modifying hours of operations, as well as closing specific floors or towers to reflect the
decrease in occupancy. In addition to our cost-cutting measures, our managers accessed additional revenue channels, particularly e-commerce channels, in an effort to offset the decline in revenues from more traditional sources.



Financing Activities

Maintaining financial flexibility was an important strategic focus throughout 2009. Despite the disruption in the credit markets, we raised
approximately $1.9 billion in cash during the year through debt and equity issuances and hotel sales. The proceeds have primarily been used to repay short-term debt maturities and to maintain higher than historical cash levels. As a result of
these efforts:

•

At year end, we held over $1.6 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, a portion of which was used to repay or redeem $470 million
of debt in the first quarter of 2010, further reducing our debt to approximately $5.4 billion at February 17, 2010. We have $600 million available under our credit facility.

•

During 2009, we repaid $342 million of mortgage debt and repurchased $149 million face amount of exchangeable senior debentures at a
$14 million discount to the face value. Excluding the recent $470 million in first quarter 2010 debt paydowns, our significant remaining debt maturities and obligations through year-end 2012 consist of $422 million of mortgage debt which
matures in 2011 (including the $300 million Orlando World Center Marriott mortgage, all or a portion of which can be extended for two one-year periods provided that debt coverage exceeds certain ratios and other conditions are met) and $325
million and $526 million of exchangeable senior debentures, which holders have the right to put to us in April 2010 and 2012, respectively.

•

As of February 17, 2010, 99 of our 110 properties are unencumbered by mortgage debt.

•

We maintained compliance with all of our senior note and credit facility covenants (see “—Financial Condition” for a detailed
description of our financial covenants and our current levels of compliance).

We believe, as a result of
these efforts and the overall strength of our balance sheet, we will have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current decline in our operating cash flow and to take advantage of investment opportunities going forward (for a detailed discussion,
see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources”).

Investing Activities

Acquisitions/Dispositions.

Acquisition opportunities that conform to our portfolio criteria were nearly
nonexistent in 2009 both domestically and internationally due to significantly depressed operating levels, ongoing capital market disruption and the uncertain economic outlook. We believe that the current operating environment, combined with the
significant number of hotel properties encumbered with very high levels of debt coming due in the next several years, may result in owners and/or lenders making these properties available for sale due to their inability to repay the debt at
maturity. We believe that these opportunities may begin to reach the market in 2011 and 2012 as distressed owners and their lenders will first explore other options. We have been actively exploring potential acquisitions and expect to be able to
take advantage of these opportunities over time as they arise.

We disposed of six non-core properties in 2009 where we
believed the potential for future returns were lower than our target levels and recognized proceeds of approximately $204 million, including the return of reserves held by the manager, that were subsequently used to repay debt and invest in our
portfolio. We recognized a gain on the dispositions totaling approximately $26 million, net of tax.

On September 11,
2009, we sold our remaining 3.6% limited partnership interest in CBM JV for approximately $13 million and recorded the gain on property transaction of $5 million, net of taxes. As a result of this transaction, we will no longer have any
continuing involvement in CBM JV.

Capital Expenditures

.

Our capital expenditures
program consists of renewal and replacement, ROI/repositioning and value enhancement projects in a broad array of areas including lobbies and public spaces, food and beverage facilities, spas, retail outlets, meeting space and rooms as well as
energy conservation and other non-public areas of the property. We completed $340 million of capital expenditures in 2009, which included $176 million in ROI/repositioning expenditures and value enhancement projects at numerous properties.
These



projects included the completion of a 62,750 square foot ballroom addition at the Swissôtel Chicago for approximately $52 million, the construction of the 12,000 square foot ballroom at The
Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island and the construction of the 10,000 square foot ballroom at the Harbor Beach Marriott Resort & Spa, which is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2010. In addition to the ROI/repositioning projects, we
spent $164 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures.

We believe that our properties are in a strong
competitive position with respect to their market competitors as a result of strategic focus on maintaining and upgrading our properties through a dedicated capital expenditures program. While overall spending on capital projects declined in 2009,
we have invested over $2.5 billion in the last five years, including the renovation of approximately 42,000 rooms and 2.3 million square feet of meeting space. We anticipate that we will spend $270 million to $300 million on
capital projects for 2010, and we continue to look for additional ways to strategically reinvest in our portfolio using our scale and relationships to drive more cost efficient purchasing and improve the overall quality of our assets.

2010 Outlook

While
economic indicators suggest that the economy and the lodging industry have begun a tentative recovery in the wake of the difficult recessionary environment in 2009, we believe that several factors, primarily uncertainty in the strength and
sustainability of an economic recovery and persistently high unemployment, will continue to negatively affect lodging industry fundamentals in 2010. We do not anticipate a significant improvement in the lodging industry until key economic
indicators, particularly GDP, business investment, employment, corporate profits and consumer spending, experience sustained quarter-over-quarter growth.

The factors discussed above will likely continue to negatively affect the group and transient demand segments in 2010. We believe occupancy, after reaching near historical lows, will begin to improve due
to the back-log of demand from long-delayed meetings and travel. However, we believe the recovery in occupancy will be muted as concerns over corporate expenditures will continue to diminish booking activity and decrease attendance at group events,
resulting in lower banquet, food and beverage and other revenues. Similarly, the reduction in corporate travel budgets and cost concerns will continue to negatively affect transient business and leisure travel. We believe the increase in occupancy
will be offset by continued rate pressure in the lodging industry. Historically, as occupancy improves average rates will increase as the mix of business shifts away from lower-rated discount and contract business to higher-rated corporate and group
business. Eventually, average rates will increase further as additional demand moves the pricing power away from the consumer. For example, while we have experienced an increase in short-term group bookings, our overall group booking pace remains
below 2008 levels. We believe that this is the result of meeting planners taking advantage of the historically low occupancy in the industry to book unoccupied rooms at a discount closer to their meeting date. This shift to short-term group bookings
also negatively affects our ability to predict our group bookings and overall results. Similarly, for our transient business, travelers will continue to take advantage of discount booking options until the industry can sustain occupancy growth.

We believe that the lodging supply growth for upper upscale and luxury hotels will begin to abate in 2010, and will be
significantly lower in 2011 and 2012 as the recession and the disruption in the credit markets caused a significant decline in new hotel construction starts beginning in the second half of 2008. This may be particularly relevant for the markets and
lodging sectors in which we compete due to the long-term planning and high level of investment associated with these properties. While we do not believe the anticipated decline in supply growth will have a significant effect on operations for 2010,
we believe that it will have a positive effect on our hotels’ performance in later years, as any demand growth which occurs will not be coupled with an increase in lodging supply.

The general economic trends discussed above make it difficult to predict our future operating results in 2010. We may experience further
declines in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, greater than anticipated weakness in the economy, changes in travel patterns and the continued impact of the trends identified above.

Hotel Sales Overview

2009 Compared to 2008.

The decrease in hotel sales and food
and beverage revenues is primarily attributable to decreased occupancy, which drives lower room rates and less demand for catering and banquet business, as well as other ancillary revenues such as spas, golf, parking, internet connectivity and other
fees. Sales for properties disposed of in both years have been reclassified as discontinued operations. See “—Discontinued Operations” below.



Consistent with the portfolio as a whole, comparable hotel RevPAR decreased 19.9%, with a
5.4 percentage point decrease in occupancy and a 13.5% decrease in average room rates. Another factor that contributed to the decrease in revenues was corporate travelers downgrading from luxury properties to other hotel segments due to political
and public relations concerns regarding corporate expenditures on luxury services. This had a significant affect on our Ritz-Carlton properties as well as our resort locations.

While management evaluates the performance of each individual hotel against its competitive set in a given market, overall we evaluate the
portfolio operating results using three different criteria: property type (i.e. urban, suburban, resort/conference or airport), geographic region and mix of business (i.e. transient, group or contract).

Comparable Hotel Sales by Property Type.

The following tables set forth performance information for 2009 and
2008:

Comparable Hotels Portfolio by Property Type(a)

(a)

The reporting period for 2009 is from December 27, 2008 to January 1, 2010 and for 2008 is from December 29, 2007 to December 26, 2008 for our
Marriott hotels. For further discussion, see “—Reporting Periods”.

Consistent with 2008, our
urban properties continued to outperform the portfolio as a whole. We believe the location of these assets provides a diversified demand base that helped drive higher levels of occupancy, which partially mitigated the decline in average room rate
compared to other property types. As noted above, our resort/conference properties were particularly affected by traveler concerns regarding corporate expenditures for luxury hotels and services.



Comparable Hotel Sales by Geographic Region.

The following
tables set forth performance information for 2009 and 2008:

Comparable Hotels by Region(a)

(a)

The reporting period for 2009 is from December 27, 2008 to January 1, 2010 and for 2008 is from December 29, 2007 to December 26, 2008 for our
Marriott hotels. For further discussion, see “—Reporting Periods”.

Other than the DC Metro
region, all of our regions had substantial declines in RevPAR, though results reflect the different dynamics of the major markets within each region. RevPAR at hotels in our top performing DC Metro region declined 5.8%, though individual properties
within the region varied from an increase of 7.4% to a decline of 25.4% in RevPAR, with the strongest performers being our downtown properties that benefited from government and government-related activity. Similarly, the 15.8% RevPAR decline in the
South Central region included a RevPAR decrease of 3.7% in New Orleans and a decline of 21.4% in Houston.

Hotel Sales by
Business Mix.

The majority of our customers fall into three broad groups: transient, group and contract business. The information below is derived from business mix data for 111 of our hotels for which business mix data is
available from our managers.

In 2009, transient RevPAR decreased 18.6% when compared to 2008, reflecting a slight decline in
total room nights and a decline in average rate of 17.7%. The decline primarily reflects a shift from the higher-rated premium and corporate business to the price-sensitive transient discount business. Room nights for premium and corporate business
declined 17.3%, despite a decline in average rates of 18.9%, which led to a RevPAR decline of 32.9% in this business. This was slightly offset by the 8.6% growth in room nights from price-sensitive transient discount business as customers,
particularly leisure travelers, utilized discount programs implemented by our managers and third-party travel websites offering discounted rates.

Group RevPAR declined approximately 23.2% reflecting a decline in total room nights of 17.2% and a decline in average room rates of 7.2%. The decline in room rate was primarily due to corporate group
discounts and short-term group rate concessions. The primary driver of the decline in room nights was a significant reduction in corporate group business of 32.8%. In addition to significant reductions in corporate group meetings, this also reflects
low attendance at group meetings and groups increasingly renegotiating rates.

2008 Compared to
2007.

Hotel sales declined in 2008 due to decreases in occupancy at our properties, as well as decreases in food and beverage and other revenue items. Sales for properties disposed of in both years have been
reclassified as discontinued operations. See “—Discontinued Operations” below.



Comparable hotel RevPAR decreased 2.6%. The decrease in RevPAR was the result of a 2.4
percentage point decrease in occupancy which was slightly offset by a .7% increase in average room rates. Occupancy was negatively affected by the decrease in overall lodging demand.

Food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels decreased 2.9%, primarily due to decreased sales from our catering and banquet business
and meeting room rentals and the decline in occupancy at our hotels. Other revenues for our comparable hotels, which primarily represent spa, golf, parking, internet connectivity and other fees, were down slightly.

Comparable Hotel Sales by Property Type.

The following tables set forth performance information for 2008 and
2007:

Comparable Hotels Portfolio by Property Type(a)

(a)

The reporting period for 2008 is from December 29, 2007 to December 26, 2008 and for 2007 is from December 30, 2006 to December 28, 2007 for our
Marriott hotels. For further discussion, see “—Reporting Periods”.

For 2008, RevPAR decreased
across all of our hotel property types. RevPAR at our resort/conference properties was particularly affected by the current economic recession due to reduced consumer spending and increased travel costs. In particular, our Hawaiian properties
experienced a dramatic decline in RevPAR as a result of decreased airlift to the Hawaiian islands and overall weak demand in this market. RevPAR at our urban, airport and suburban hotels also declined due to the overall decline in lodging demand.

information for 2008 and 2007:

The reporting period for 2008 is from December 29, 2007 to December 26, 2008 and for 2007 is from December 30, 2006 to December 28, 2007 for our
Marriott hotels. For further discussion, see “Reporting Periods”.



In terms of RevPAR growth, our International region was the top performing region due to
RevPAR growth at our Chilean and Canadian hotels and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Comparable hotel RevPAR growth in our Florida region was driven by RevPAR growth at the Harbor Beach Marriott where we benefited from prior
year disruption caused by rooms’ renovations and the Orlando World Center Marriott where significant discounting drove transient demand. RevPAR results were partially offset by rooms’ renovations at three hotels in the Florida region, as
well as the impact of Hurricane Fay. RevPAR growth in the South Central region was the result of year-over-year growth in our Houston market which had a strong fourth quarter due to Hurricane Ike induced demand as well as our San Antonio properties,
which experienced strong group business because of recent renovations in the fourth quarter of 2007.

The RevPAR decline in
our Pacific region was driven by the 17.1% RevPAR decline at our Hawaiian properties and a 3.8% decline at our San Diego properties. The region’s best performer based on RevPAR growth was the San Francisco market which had a 1.9% increase in
RevPAR. However, the RevPAR growth was concentrated in the first half of the year, as RevPAR in San Francisco declined significantly in the fourth quarter. RevPAR in our New England region also declined, reflecting decreased demand at our Boston
hotels due to fewer city-wide events and softening leisure demand. In addition, we experienced higher group attrition and cancellations than in prior periods.

The North Central region underperformed other regions, as results in Chicago were particularly weak due primarily to renovations at three of our Chicago properties and lower transient demand. The Atlanta
region also underperformed in comparison to the overall portfolio due to weak group bookings, lower transient demand and increased supply. RevPAR in our Mountain region also declined as the Phoenix market continued to struggle due to lower group and
transient demand and rooms renovations at two hotels.

Hotel Sales by Business Mix.

The
information below is derived from business mix data for 108 of our hotels for which business mix data is available from our managers.

In 2008, overall transient average daily rates decreased 1.3% when compared to 2007 while our overall group average room rate increased almost 3.9% over the prior year as most of the business was contracted prior to any significant
downturn.

Property-level Operating Expenses.

2009 compared to 2008 and 2008 compared to 2007.

The overall
decrease in operating expenses is consistent with lower overall demand at our properties and our hotel managers actively implementing contingency plans and cost saving measures to manage operating margin decline. Our operating costs and expenses,
which are both fixed and variable, are affected by changes in occupancy, inflationary increases and revenues (which affect management fees), though the effect on specific costs will differ. Property-level operating expenses exclude the costs
associated with hotels we have sold during the periods presented, which are included in discontinued operations.



Rooms.

The decrease in room expenses was primarily due to a
decrease in occupancy. We also benefited from cost cutting measures implemented by our managers that reduced controllable expenses, such as closing rooms in unused sections of the hotels, and reducing management staff and labor hours per occupied
room.

Food and Beverage.

The decline in food and beverages costs was primarily driven by a
decrease in occupancy, which led to a reduction in food and beverages cost of good sold, and reductions in restaurant hourly and management staff.

Other departmental and support expenses.

The decline in these expenses reflected a reduction in controllable expenses such as marketing and general and administration
expenses that were driven by a decrease in the wages and benefits allocated to these expenses, reflecting a decline in management staffing and bonus payouts. Additionally, utilities declined 11.5% as a result of a decline in prices, lower occupancy
levels and milder weather.

Management fees.

Our base management fees, which are
generally calculated as a percentage of total revenues, declined 20% for the year, which is consistent with our revenue decline. The incentive management fees, which are based on the level of operating profit at each property after the owner has
received a priority return on its investment, declined 67% during 2009 as a result of the decline in operating profit at the hotel level.

Other property-level expenses.

These expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. For 2009, the
slight increase was primarily driven by the increase in ground rent expense related to the New York Marriott Marquis, which was largely offset by decreases in insurance, equipment rental and other property-level costs.

Depreciation and amortization.

During 2009, the increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to
$66 million of impairment charges included in continuing operations as well as an increase in depreciation expense due to our extensive $1.8 billion capital expenditure program from 2006 to 2008.

During 2009, we identified properties to be tested for impairment based on certain events or circumstances that occurred which indicated
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable as compared to projected undiscounted cash flows, as prescribed by GAAP. We tested these properties for impairment based on management’s estimate of expected future undiscounted cash flows over
our expected holding period. As a result of these analyses, we recorded non-cash property impairment charges totaling $97 million for the year based on the difference between the fair value of these properties and their carrying amounts. Of
these property impairment charges, $31 million has been included in discontinued operations for the year-to-date period. During 2008, we identified one property for impairment and recorded $3 million of impairment charges, which are
included in discontinued operations. See “—Critical Accounting Policies—Impairment testing” for further discussion of our policies regarding impairments.

In addition, our investment in the European joint venture exceeded its fair value on an other-than-temporary basis, and we recorded an
impairment charge of $34 million which is included in equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates. See “—Other Income Statement Line Items—Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Affiliates” for further detail.

Other Income Statement Line Items

Corporate and Other Expense

s.

Corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as other costs such as travel,
corporate insurance, audit fees, building rent and system costs. Corporate expenses increased approximately $58 million in 2009 from 2008 and decreased approximately $11 million in 2008 from 2007. The increase in 2009 includes an expense
accrual of approximately $41 million, or $.07 per common share, based on a range of possible outcomes for a potential litigation loss. See “Legal Proceedings.” Additionally, higher corporate expenses reflected an increase in stock
expense in a return to more normalized levels, as well as an increase in the stock price during 2009.



Gain on Insurance Settlement.

We recorded a gain on
insurance settlement of $7 million in 2008 and $51 million in 2007. The gains primarily relate to the insurance proceeds received for both business interruption and property damage following Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma which occurred
during September and October 2005, respectively. The hurricanes caused substantial business interruption and property damage at our New Orleans Marriott and at five of our hotels located in southern Florida. The gain represents the insurance
proceeds received in excess of the insurance receivable recorded on the balance sheet at the date of loss. The insurance receivable reflected the book value of the property and equipment written off and repairs and maintenance costs incurred from
the hurricanes. We recognize the gains on insurance settlements once all contingencies are met, and, as a result, none of the property insurance proceeds were recognized in income during 2005 or 2006.

Interest Income

.

The $13 million decline in interest income for 2009 when compared to 2008
is primarily due to lower rates for 2009 compared to 2008. The $17 million decline in interest income for 2008 when compared to 2007 is primarily due to lower interest rates during 2008, as well as a slightly lower weighted average cash balance
for the full year 2008 compared to 2007.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense
increased 1% to $379 million in 2009. Interest expense includes $27 million, $30 million and $25 million of non-cash interest expense for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to our exchangeable debentures associated with the
implementation of the new U.S. GAAP requirement. See “—Critical Accounting Policies—Implementation of New Accounting Standards.”

The decrease of $69 million in interest expense for 2008 from 2007 is primarily due to an expense of $45 million related to call premiums and the acceleration of the amortization of deferred
financing costs associated with debt prepayments during 2007 compared to a $14 million gain in 2008 related to the repurchase of $100 million principal amount of our 2004 Debentures. The decline in interest expense also reflects the decrease in
our weighted average interest rate of 0.4 percentage points to 6.4%.

Equity in Earnings (Losses) of
Affiliates.

In 2009, our share of losses from affiliates increased by $22 million compared to 2008 primarily due to the $34 million non-cash impairment charge related to our investment in the joint venture in
Europe and the overall decline in operations at these hotels. Results also were affected by the settlement of a lawsuit in 2009 relating to the return of an initial deposit for a terminated acquisition, which resulted in a gain of $8 million.
We recognized a loss of $11 million in 2008 due to uncertainties surrounding this litigation.

We evaluate the
recoverability of our investment in affiliates based on our assessment of the fair value of our investment in comparison to our carrying value. In 2009, we determined that the carrying value of our investment in our joint venture in Europe exceeded
its fair value on an other-than-temporary basis. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $34 million which is included in equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates. See “—Critical Accounting
Policies—

Other-than-Temporary Impairment of an Investment

” for further discussion.

Net Income/Loss
Attributable to Non-controlling interests.

Net income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased $25 million in 2009 and $12 million in 2008 due to a decline in the net income of Host LP during both
years. Host LP net income reflects the operations at our hotels and is significantly affected by the gain on dispositions, which were $26 million, $24 million and $164 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



Discontinued Operations.

Discontinued operations
consist of six hotels disposed of in 2009 (including one hotel for which the ground lease expired and will revert back to the ground lessor), two hotels disposed of during 2008 and nine hotels disposed of in 2007 and represent the results of
operations and the gains on the disposition of these hotels during the periods. The following table summarizes the revenues, income before taxes, and the gain on dispositions, net of tax, of the hotels which have been reclassified to discontinued
operations, which includes assets held for sale and the results of sold hotels prior to their disposition, in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (in millions):

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview.

We seek to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an
appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility to pursue opportunities given the cyclical nature of the lodging industry. Consistent with our strategic goals and the overall economic climate in 2009, we focused on
preserving capital, increasing liquidity and extending debt maturities. We raised approximately $1.9 billion through debt and equity issuances and hotel sales. We used the proceeds from these transactions and available cash to repay
$153 million face amount of senior notes and debentures with a carrying value of $144 million for $139 million, to repay $410 million outstanding under our credit facility and to repay $342 million in mortgage debt. We also
repaid $470 million of debt in the first quarter of 2010 as discussed below. We intend to use the remaining proceeds to repay debt, acquire new properties and invest in our portfolio through our capital expenditure program. We believe we have
sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to withstand declines in operating cash flow, pay our near-term debt maturities and fund our capital expenditure programs. We expect to maintain higher than historical cash levels until the
credit markets stabilize and operating conditions improve.

The chart below details our significant cash flows for the three
years ended December 31, 2009:

Cash
Requirements.

We use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, corporate and other expenses and dividends to stockholders. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our
taxable income (excluding net capital gain) to our stockholders. During 2009, we took advantage of guidance issued by the IRS to satisfy up to 90% of our REIT distribution requirements through the issuance of stock dividends. Therefore, we declared
a $.25 per share special dividend in the fourth quarter, which was paid



90% with common stock and 10% with cash. Funds used to make cash distributions are provided by Host LP. Our sources of cash are cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings
under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances.

Set forth below is a schedule of our debt maturities through 2012.
As of December 31, 2009, our weighted average interest rate is 6.6% and our weighted average maturity is 4.4 years. Our remaining near term debt maturities in 2010 and 2011 are relatively low. Maturities in 2011 total $430 million and
include the $300 million Orlando World Center Marriott mortgage, which is subject to extension, in whole or in part, at our option if certain requirements are met. See “—Financial Condition” for more information on our debt
maturities. During the first quarter of 2010, we used the proceeds from the issuance of the 2009 Debentures and available cash to redeem the remaining $346 million of 7% Series M senior notes which were due in August 2012 and to repay the
$124 million mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis. Due to these repayments, the $470 million in maturities have been excluded in the chart below:

Remaining Debt Maturities 2010—2012

(in millions)

(1)

Our 3.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures are due in 2024 but are subject to a put option by the holders on April 15, 2010. The $325 million represents the face
amount of the outstanding principal at December 31, 2009.

(2)

This mortgage in whole or in part is subject to two, one-year extension options provided that debt coverage exceeds certain ratios and other conditions are met.

(3)

Our 2.625% Exchangeable Senior Debentures are due in 2027, but are subject to a put option by the holders on April 15, 2012. The $526 million represents the face
amount of the outstanding principal at December 31, 2009.

Capital
Resources.

As of December 31, 2009, we had over $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which was an increase of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2008. We also had $600 million available under
our credit facility at December 31, 2009. During the first quarter of 2010, we redeemed or repaid $470 million of outstanding debt with our available cash. We depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth,
including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Therefore, our financial flexibility (including our
ability to incur debt, pay dividends and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants, which include, among others, the allowable amounts of leverage, coverage and fixed charges. During 2009, as
operations at our hotels declined, management completed several debt and equity transactions in order to mitigate the effects of the decline in operations on our financial flexibility. As a result of these efforts, we have significantly decreased
our near-term debt maturities, reduced our secured mortgage indebtedness and maintained compliance with our senior note and credit facility covenants, despite the decline in operating results at our hotels.

If, at any time, we determine that market conditions are favorable, after taking into account our liquidity requirements, we may seek to
issue and sell shares of Host common stock in registered public offerings, including through sales directly on the NYSE under our current “at the market” offering program referred to above, or to issue and sell shares of Host preferred
stock. We may also seek to cause Host LP to issue, in offerings exempt from registration under the securities laws, debentures exchangeable for shares of our common



stock or senior notes. Given our total debt level, typically a portion will come due every year and for that reason we may also continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from
time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions when available. In February 2010, Host’s Board of Directors authorized repurchases up to $400 million of senior notes, exchangeable debentures and mortgage debt (other than in
accordance with its terms). We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms.
Repurchases of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and FFO per diluted share,
as defined below, as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs. Accordingly, in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile, and given the
movement in prevailing conditions in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the purchase or sale of common stock, exchangeable debentures and/or senior
notes. Any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur contemporaneously.

As of February 17,
2010, subsequent to the repayment of the $124 million mortgage loan on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis, our secured mortgage indebtedness totaled approximately $1.1 billion, which represents approximately 20% of our overall indebtedness, and
is secured by 11 of our hotels. Accordingly, 99 of our hotels are unencumbered by mortgage debt. Given the flexibility provided by the structure of our balance sheet, we will look to access the capital markets for senior notes and exchangeable
debentures and the secured mortgage debt market, based on relative pricing and capacity to fund our cash requirements. We may, at any time, seek to access such markets in the event that we determine that the terms and conditions available to us are
advantageous based upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other circumstances. See “—Financial Condition” for further discussion of our restrictive covenants.

Counterparty Credit Risk.

We are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of
counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. As a result of the recent bankruptcy and insolvency of several
high-profile, well-respected financial institutions, we have performed additional assessments to determine the impact, if any, of these market developments on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at
various financial institutions, access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts. Our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited. Our exposure with regard to our cash and the $600 million available
under our credit facility is mitigated as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions. At December 31, 2009, our exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totaled $3.4 million and
the counterparties were investment grade financial institutions.

Sources and Uses of
Cash.

During 2009, our primary sources of cash included cash from operations, proceeds from debt and equity issuances and proceeds from the sale of assets. Uses of cash during the year primarily consisted of capital
expenditures, operating costs and debt repayments and repurchases. Uses of cash during 2010 will include the repayment or repurchase of our debt maturing in the near-term, capital expenditures at our hotels and dividends on our preferred stock.
Other uses may include, among other things, investment in our European, Asian or other joint ventures or hotel acquisitions. We anticipate that our primary sources of cash for 2010 will include cash from operations and proceeds from hotel
dispositions and equity issuances.

Cash Provided by Operations.

Our cash provided by operations
for 2009 decreased $468 million to $552 million compared to 2008, due primarily to declines in operations at our hotels.

Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Approximately $116 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2009. This included approximately $340 million of capital expenditures, partially offset
by the return of a $39 million investment in the European joint venture and $212 million of net proceeds from the disposition of assets.



Capital Expenditures

In 2009, total capital expenditures decreased $332 million to $340 million. Our renewal and replacement capital expenditures for
2009 were approximately $164 million, which reflects a decrease of approximately 56% from 2008 levels. Our renewal and replacement capital expenditures are generally funded by the furniture, fixture and equipment funds established at certain of
our hotels (typically funded with approximately 5% of property revenues) and by our available cash. We also spent approximately $176 million in 2009 on ROI/repositioning projects, which reflects a decrease of approximately 41% compared to 2008
levels. While capital expenditures declined in 2009, they have totaled approximately $2.5 billion over the past five years. As a result, we believe that our properties are in a strong competitive position with respect to their market
competitors.

Acquisitions/Dispositions and Investments

During 2009, we disposed of six non-core properties where we believed the potential for revenue growth was low. Proceeds from these sales
were approximately $204 million, including the return of reserves held by the manager, and were used to repay debt and invest in our portfolio. We recognized a gain on the dispositions totaling approximately $26 million, net of tax, in 2009.

On September 11, 2009, we sold our remaining 3.6% limited partnership interest in CBM JV for approximately
$13 million and recorded the gain on property transaction of $5 million, net of taxes. As a result of this transaction, we no longer have any continuing involvement in CBM JV.

We did not complete any acquisitions in 2009 or 2008. We believe that the current operating environment, combined with the significant
number of hotel properties encumbered with very high levels of debt, may result in owners and/or lenders making these properties available for sale due to their inability to repay the debt at maturity. We believe that these opportunities may not
reach the market until 2011 and 2012 or subsequent years as distressed owners and their lenders will first explore other options. However, we have been actively exploring potential acquisitions and expect to be able to take advantage of these
opportunities over time as they arise. We may also purchase mortgage debt that is secured by hotel properties or mezzanine debt where we believe we can buy the debt at a discount and earn attractive returns through principal and interest payments or
the eventual ownership of the hotel through foreclosure.

We may acquire additional properties through various structures,
including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs or similar real estate entities. We anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed
through a combination of methods, including proceeds from sales of properties from our existing portfolio, the incurrence of debt, available cash, advances under our credit facility, proceeds from equity offerings of Host, or issuance of OP units by
Host LP.



The following table summarizes significant investment activities and dispositions that have
been completed since the beginning of January 2008 (in millions):

(1)

Represents our investments for the acquisitions of the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam City Centre, as well as our investments to acquire a portfolio of hotels. The portfolio
transaction was terminated in 2008 and, therefore, the European joint venture returned approximately $39 million of these funds in January 2009.

(2)

Includes $5 million of reserves which were returned by the hotel manager.

Cash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $698 million for 2009, as compared to cash used in financing activities of
$284 million in 2008. During 2009, we received proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion through the issuance of debt and equity securities.

Debt Transactions

During 2009, we completed several
significant debt transactions that provided financial flexibility and extended our debt maturity profile. On December 22, 2009, Host LP issued $400 million, 2


/


% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (the “2009 Debentures”)
and received proceeds of $391 million, net of underwriting fees and expenses. The debentures are currently exchangeable at a rate of $14.08 per share and we have the option, upon exchange, to provide the exchange value in either cash, shares of
Host common stock, or a combination thereof. In January 2010, the proceeds from the issuance and available cash were used to redeem the remaining $346 million in 7% Series M senior notes and to repay the $124 million mortgage on the
Atlanta Marriott Marquis. Additionally, we received proceeds of $380 million from the issuance of the $400 million, 9% Series T notes in May 2009 and closed a $120 million floating rate mortgage loan secured by our JW Marriott, Washington
D.C. in March 2009. During 2009, proceeds from these transactions, along with the proceeds from our equity transactions and available cash, were used to repay $153 million face amount of senior notes and debentures with a carrying value of
$144 million for $139 million, to repay $410 million outstanding under our credit facility and to repay $342 million in mortgage debt.



The following table summarizes significant debt (net of deferred financing costs)
transactions since the beginning of January 2008 (in millions):

(1)

Of the proceeds, $82 million was allocated to additional paid-in capital to recognize for the equity component of the debentures.

(2)

The JW Marriott, Washington, D.C. mortgage has a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 600 basis points, with a LIBOR floor of 1.5% and a LIBOR cap of 3%. The interest
rate shown reflects the rate in effect at December 31, 2009.

(3)

The Orlando World Center Marriott mortgage has a floating rate of interest of LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The interest rate shown reflects the rate in effect at
December 31, 2009.

Equity Transactions

We issued approximately 104 million shares of common stock in 2009 for net proceeds of $767 million. On April 29, 2009, we issued
75.75 million shares of common stock at $6.60 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $480 million, after underwriting discounts and commissions and transaction expenses.



On August 19, 2009, we entered into a Sales Agency Financing Agreement with BNY Mellon
Capital Markets, LLC, through which we may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $400 million (the “ATM Program”). The sales will be made in “at the market”
offerings under SEC rules, including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange. BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC is acting as sales agent. During the fourth quarter, Host issued approximately 15 million shares of common stock for net
proceeds of $157 million, net of $2 million of commissions, at an average net price per share of approximately $10.49. Since the inception of the ATM Program, we have issued nearly 28 million shares for net proceeds of over $287 million,
net of $3 million of commissions, at an average net price per share of approximately $10.27. We may continue to sell shares of common stock under this program from time-to-time based on market conditions, although we are not under an obligation
to sell any shares.

During 2009, our cash common stock dividend payments decreased $480 million from $522 million in
2008 to $42 million. In the fourth quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $0.25 per share on our common stock. The special dividend was paid on December 18, 2009 to stockholders of record as of
November 6, 2009. In reliance on the specific terms of guidance issued by the IRS, we paid 90% of the dividend with Host common stock, with the remaining 10% paid with cash. Our 2009 dividend payments also include the fourth quarter 2008
dividend of $.05 per share, which was paid in the first quarter of 2009. The dividend payments for 2008 include $.20 per share dividends for each of the first, second and third quarters thereof, as well as the fourth quarter 2007 dividend of $.40,
which was paid in the first quarter of 2008.

The following table summarizes significant equity transactions since the
beginning of January 2008 (in millions):



Financial Condition

As of December 31, 2009, our total debt was approximately $5.8 billion of which 88% carried a fixed rate of interest. Total debt was comprised of (in millions):

(1)

During the first quarter of 2010, we redeemed the remaining $346 million in 7% Series M senior notes and repaid the $124 million mortgage debt on the Atlanta
Marriott Marquis.

(2)

The assets securing mortgage debt represents the book value of real estate assets, net of accumulated depreciation. These amounts do not represent the current market
value of the assets.

Aggregate debt maturities at December 31, 2009 are as follows (in millions):

(1)

The 2010 maturities include $346 million of our Series M senior notes and the $124 million mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis, which were repaid on
January 20, 2010, and February 11, 2010, respectively. After these repayments, 2010 debt maturities total $334 million.

(2)

The debt maturing in 2011 includes the $300 million mortgage loan on the Orlando World Center Marriott, which can be extended, in whole or in part, for two,
one-year periods, subject to achieving a certain debt coverage ratio and other conditions.

Senior
Notes.

The following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by Host LP, which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture. We pay
interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes at specified dates in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior



notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host LP’s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host LP. The notes outstanding under our senior notes
indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture, as well
as our credit facility, certain other senior debt, and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. The pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio
falls below 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters. Because our leverage ratio is below this threshold, we have the right to release all pledges at any time. In October 2005, we exercised this right for pledges of capital stock that would have
been otherwise required subsequent to this date.

Restrictive Covenants

.    Under the terms of the
senior notes indenture, our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0x by Host LP.
Furthermore, Host LP is able to make distributions to enable Host to pay dividends on its preferred stock under the senior notes indenture when our EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is above 1.7 to 1.0. This ratio is calculated in accordance with
the terms of our senior notes indenture based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the
terms of our senior notes indenture, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or
discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and approximately $27 million of interest expense recorded in 2009 related to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense
on our consolidated statements of operations. Our subsidiaries are subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture, however, in certain circumstances, we are permitted to designate certain subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These
unrestricted subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants (unless they are guarantors) and may engage in transactions to dispose of or encumber their assets or otherwise incur additional indebtedness without complying with the
restrictive covenants in the indenture. If we were to designate additional subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, neither the EBITDA generated by nor the interest expense allocated to these entities would be included in our ratio
calculations. Other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), excluding intangible assets,
and secured indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets. So long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, we may pay preferred or common dividends and
incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture, including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition. The decline in operations over the past two years has caused a decline in our EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio. If economic
conditions continue to weaken, we would expect this trend to continue. However, even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and pay dividends, we are still permitted to incur certain types of debt, including
(i) credit facility debt, (ii) refinancing debt, (iii) up to $300 million of mortgage debt whose proceeds would be used to repay debt under credit facility (and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility
by such amount), and (iv) up to $100 million of other debt. We also are permitted to pay dividends of estimated taxable income necessary to maintain Host’s REIT status.

Our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters, such as our ability to pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our
equity interests; make investments; permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries; sell assets; guarantee indebtedness; enter into transactions with affiliates; create certain liens; and sell certain assets or merge with or
into other companies. Our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets (as defined in the indenture as undepreciated property value) of not less than 125% of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other
debt not secured by mortgages. This coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or pay dividends discussed above (whose consequences, where we fall below the coverage
level, are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or pay dividends, but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture).



We are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture.
The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture as of December 31, 2009:

Exchangeable Debentures—General.

We separately account for the liability and equity components of our exchangeable debentures to reflect the fair value of the liability
component based on our non-convertible borrowing cost at the issuance date. Accordingly, for our 2


/


% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (the “2009 Debentures”), our 2


/


% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (the “2007 Debentures”)
and our 3


/


% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (the
“2004 Debentures”) (collectively, the “Debentures”), we record the liability components of the Debentures at fair value as of the date of issuance and amortize the resulting discount as an increase to interest expense over the
expected life of the debt; however, there is no effect on our cash interest payments. We measured the fair value of the debt components of the 2009 Debentures, 2007 Debentures and 2004 Debentures at issuance based on effective interest rates of
6.9%, 6.5% and 6.8%, respectively. As a result, we attributed $247 million of the proceeds received to the conversion feature of the Debentures. This amount represents the excess proceeds received over the fair value of the debt at the date of
issuance and is included in additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The following details the initial allocations between the debt and equity components of the debentures, net of the original issue discount, based on
the effective interest rate at the time of issuance, as well as the debt balances at December 31, 2009:

2009 Exchangeable Senior
Debentures.

On December 22, 2009, Host LP issued $400 million of 2


/


% Exchangeable Senior Debentures and received proceeds of $391 million, net of underwriting fees and expenses. The 2009 Debentures mature on October 15, 2029 and are equal in right
of payment with all of our other senior notes. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase the 2009
Debentures on October 15, 2015, October 15, 2019 and October 15, 2024 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders may exchange their 2009 Debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions,
including at any time at which the closing sale price of our common stock is more than 130% of the exchange price per share for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days prior to the date on which
the



debentures have been called for redemption. On exchange, we must deliver cash, shares or a combination thereof at our option in an amount equal to the exchange value (which is the applicable
exchange rate multiplied by the average exchange price of our common shares). The current exchange rate is 71.0101 shares for each $1,000 of principal amount of the 2009 Debentures, which is equivalent to an exchange price of $14.08 per share. The
exchange rate is adjusted for certain circumstances, including the payment of common dividends. We can redeem for cash all or part of, the 2009 Debentures at any time on or after October 20, 2015 upon 15 days notice at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. If we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures at the exchange value described above
rather than receive the cash redemption price. The 2009 Debentures are not currently exchangeable.

2007 Exchangeable Senior Debentures.

On March 23, 2007, Host LP issued $600 million 2


/


% Exchangeable Senior Debentures and received proceeds of $589 million, net of underwriting fees and expenses and
original issue discount. During 2009, we repurchased approximately $74 million face amount of the 2007 Debentures for approximately $66 million. As of December 31, 2009, we have $526 million face amount of the 2007 Debentures
that remain outstanding. The outstanding 2007 Debentures mature on April 15, 2027 and are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and
October 15 of each year beginning on July 15, 2007. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, the 2007 Debentures at any time on or after April 20, 2012 upon 15 days notice at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus
accrued interest. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase the 2007 Debentures on April 15, 2012, April 15, 2017 and April 15, 2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders may exchange
their 2007 Debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions, including when the closing sale price of Host’s common stock is more than 130% of the exchange price per share for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain
periods or any time up to two days prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption. On exchange, we must deliver cash in an amount equal to not less than the lower of the exchange value (which is the applicable exchange
rate multiplied by the average price of our common shares) and the aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Debentures to be exchanged and, at our option, shares, cash or a combination thereof for any excess above the principal value. If we elect to
redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures at the exchange value described above rather than receive the cash redemption price. The exchange rate at
December 31, 2009 was 32.0239 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, which is equivalent to an exchange price of $31.23 per share of Host common stock. The exchange rate may be adjusted under certain circumstances
including the payment of common dividends exceeding $.20 per share in any given quarter. The 2007 Debentures are not currently exchangeable.

2004 Exchangeable Senior Debentures.

On March 16, 2004, Host LP issued $500 million of 3.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures and received proceeds of
$484 million, net of discounts, underwriting fees and expenses. During 2008 and 2009, we repurchased $175 million face amount of the 2004 Debentures for approximately $151 million and recorded gains on repurchase of approximately
$17 million. As of December 31, 2009, $325 million face amount of the 2004 Debentures remain outstanding. The outstanding 2004 Debentures mature on April 15, 2024 and are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior
notes. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase the 2004 Debentures on April 15,
2010, April 15, 2014 and April 15, 2019 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount. Holders may exchange their 2004 Debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions, including at any time at which the closing sale price of
our common stock is more than 120% of the exchange price per share, for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption. The
exchange rate at December 31, 2009 was 65.3258 shares for each $1,000 of principal amount of the 2004 Debentures, (which is equivalent to an exchange price of $15.31 per share). The exchange rate is adjusted for certain circumstances, including
the payment of common dividends. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, the 2004 Debentures at any time subsequent to April 19, 2009 upon 30 days notice at the applicable redemption price as set forth in the indenture. If we elect to redeem
the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we



would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures for stock rather than receive the cash redemption price. The 2004 Debentures are not currently exchangeable.

Credit Facility.

On May 25, 2007, we entered into a second amended and restated bank credit
facility with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Citicorp North America Inc., Société Générale and Calyon New York Branch, as Co-Documentation Agents
and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of $600 million. During any period in which our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to such
amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount under the credit facility to exceed $300 million. The credit facility also includes subcommitments for (i) the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of
$10 million and (ii) loans in certain foreign currencies in an aggregate amount of $300 million, (A) $150 million of which may be loaned to certain of our Canadian subsidiaries in Canadian Dollars and
(B) $300 million of which may be loaned to us in Pounds Sterling and Euros. The credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of September 2011. We have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are
met as of September 2011. These conditions include the payment of a fee to the lenders, that no default or event of default exists and maintaining a leverage ratio below 6.75x. Subject to certain conditions, we also have the option to increase the
amount of the facility by up to $190 million to the extent that any one or more lenders, whether or not currently party to the credit facility, commits to be a lender for such amount.

In 2008, we entered into a $210 million term loan under the credit facility. In 2008, we also borrowed $200 million under the
revolver portion of our credit facility at a rate of LIBOR plus 65 basis points based on our leverage. The term loan and the credit facility were repaid in 2009, and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. Based on our
leverage at December 31, 2009, we have $600 million of available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility.

The obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The pledges are permitted to be released in the event
that certain conditions are satisfied, including the requirement that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters. As a result of having satisfied such conditions, currently we are not required to pledge our equity
interests in any newly acquired or formed subsidiary, and at our election, we may obtain a release of all existing pledges for so long as our leverage ratio continues to be below 6.0x. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility,
as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility.

Financial Covenants.

The credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge
coverage and unsecured interest coverage. Due to the decline in operations over the past two years, our unsecured interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio have declined and our leverage ratio has increased. If economic conditions
continue to weaken, we would expect this trend to continue. We are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 7.25x and our unsecured coverage ratio is
not less than 1.75x. If our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the credit facility to exceed $300 million. However, to the extent our
borrowings under the credit facility revolver exceed $300 million on the date that our leverage ratio exceeds 7.0x, we are not required to repay the excess for one year. The financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no
borrowings under the credit facility. Hence, so long as there are no amounts outstanding, we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we
were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants. These calculations are performed in accordance with our credit facility based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as
acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the



extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to
establish the debt at fair value and, approximately $27 million of interest expense recorded in 2009 as a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard relating to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense
on our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a “net debt” concept under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million is deducted from our
total debt balance.

We are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility. The following table
summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of December 31, 2009:

(a)

If at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will lower to 1.5x.

Interest and Fees.

We pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates plus a
margin that is set with reference to our leverage ratio. In the case of LIBOR borrowings in U.S. Dollars, as well as Euros and Pounds Sterling denominated borrowings, the rate of interest ranges from 65 basis points to 150 basis points over LIBOR.
We also have the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points and the Prime Lending Rate, plus, in both cases, the applicable spread ranging from 0 to 50 basis points. Based on our leverage
ratio at December 31, 2009 of 5.3x, we can borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 90 basis points or Prime plus 0 basis points. To the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion
of the loan commitment of 10 to 15 basis points, depending on our average revolver usage during the applicable period.

Other Covenants.

The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x. In particular, at any
time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures, and the limitations on acquisitions, investments and dividends contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less
restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture. Additionally, the credit facility’s restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends are generally consistent with our senior notes indenture. These provisions,
under certain circumstances, limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing, and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain our tax status as a REIT.

Mortgage and Other Debt

.    As of December 31, 2009, we had 12 hotels that were secured by mortgage
debt. After the repayment of the $124 million mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis, we currently have 11 hotels that are secured by mortgage debt. Substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances
of fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2009, secured debt represented approximately 21% of our total debt and our aggregate secured debt had an average interest rate of 5.1% and an average
maturity of 3.2 years.



The following table summarizes our outstanding debt and scheduled amortization and
maturities related to mortgage and other debt as of December 31, 2009 (in millions):

(1)

This floating rate mortgage is based on LIBOR plus 600 basis points, with a LIBOR floor of 1.5% and a LIBOR cap of 3%. The rate shown reflects the rate in effect at
December 31, 2009.

(2)

This floating rate mortgage is based on LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The rate shown reflects the rate in effect at December 31, 2009. The loan may be extended in
whole or in part, at our option, for two one-year periods, subject to certain conditions. We anticipate that the property will have sufficient funds to cover debt service and all operating requirements in 2010. However, based on the
December 31, 2009 debt service coverage ratio, the loan agreement requires that we deposit excess cash flow generated by the hotel into a lender restricted escrow.

This loan was repaid in February 2010.

During 2009, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements for the total notional amount outstanding on this loan. The rate shown reflects the weighted average
interest rate in effect at December 31, 2009.

(5)

Beginning in June 2010, the interest rate on this loan increases a minimum of 200 basis points and all excess cash (as defined in the loan agreement) generated by the
partnership that owns this property is applied to principal; however, the loan can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date. The amortization presented is the minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate, but does
not include additional principal payments based on excess cash flow. Currently, the cash flow from this property is substantially below the debt service and we are evaluating our options with respect to this property and the associated mortgage
debt.

(6)

Beginning in 2013, the interest rate on this loan increases a minimum of 500 basis points and all excess cash (as defined in the loan agreement) generated by the
partnership that owns this property is applied to principal; however, the loan can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date. The amortization presented is the minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate, but does
not include additional principal payments based on excess cash flow.

(7)

Other mortgage debt consists of individual mortgage debt amounts that are less than $40 million, have an average interest rate of 5.2% at December 31, 2009
and mature through 2011.

(8)

Industrial revenue bonds and other consist of loans with an average interest rate of 7.1% that mature through 2016, and capital leases with varying interest rates and
maturity dates.



Mortgage Debt of Consolidated and Unconsolidated Partner
Interests.

For the entities that we consolidate in our financial statements that have third party non-controlling partnership interests, the portion of mortgage debt included in the above table that is attributable to
the non-controlling interests, based on their percentage of ownership of the partnerships, is approximately $68 million. Additionally, we have non-controlling interests in partnerships and joint ventures that are not consolidated and are
accounted for under the equity method. The portion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships attributable to us, based on our percentage of ownership of the partnerships, was $332 million at December 31, 2009. Nearly all of this
debt balance is attributable to our 32.1% ownership interest in the European joint venture. The mortgage debt related to our European joint venture hotels contains operating covenants that could result in the joint venture being required to escrow
cash from operations or make principal repayments without penalty. The debt of all our unconsolidated partnerships is non-recourse to us. See “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations.”

Credit Ratings.

As of December 31, 2009, we have approximately $4.5 billion of senior notes
outstanding and $100 million of preferred stock that are rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Moody’s rating on our senior note debt is Ba1 and our preferred stock is Ba2, both with a
negative outlook. During 2009, Standard & Poor’s downgraded our senior note debt one notch from BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating, to BB+. Standard & Poor’s rating on our preferred stock is at B. In addition,
Standard & Poor’s has maintained its negative outlook. During 2009, Fitch Ratings downgraded our senior note debt from BB+ to BB-. The rating on our preferred stock was also downgraded from BB- to B. Fitch Ratings has also placed us on
negative outlook. If our operations or our credit ratios continue to decline, the ratings on our securities could be further reduced. If we were unable to subsequently improve our credit ratings, our cost to issue senior notes, either in connection
with a refinancing or otherwise, or additional preferred stock would likely increase.

Dividend
Policy

.    Host is required to distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income, excluding net capital gain, to its stockholders in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, including taxable income recognized
for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash. Funds used by Host to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock are provided through distributions from Host LP. As of February 17, 2010, Host is the owner
of substantially all of the preferred OP units and approximately 98% of the common OP units. The remaining 2% of the common OP units are held by various third-party limited partners.

Host intends to reinstate its quarterly common dividend payment and to pay a $.01 per share dividend with respect to its common stock
beginning in the first quarter of 2010 even if we do not have taxable income in 2010. Host’s policy on common dividends is generally to distribute, over time, 100% of its taxable income. We suspended our regular quarterly common dividend
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and, for 2009, instead declared a $.25 per share special common dividend in the fourth quarter, described in more detail below. Host currently intends to continue paying dividends on its preferred stock,
regardless of the amount of its taxable income, unless contractually restricted. The amount of any future dividend will be determined by Host’s Board of Directors.

On September 14, 2009, Host’s Board of Directors authorized a special dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock of Host, payable in cash and shares of Host common stock, at the election of the
stockholder. The dividend was paid on December 18, 2009 to holders of record as of November 6, 2009. In order to comply with Host’s remaining REIT taxable income distribution requirements for the year ended December 31, 2008,
while retaining capital and maintaining maximum financial flexibility, Host’s Board of Directors determined that the cash component of the dividend (other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) would not exceed 10% in the aggregate. After
giving effect to stockholder elections and the effect of the cash limitation, the dividend paid consisted of approximately 13.4 million shares of Host common stock (90% of the dividend) and $15.6 million of cash (10% of the dividend).

Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Host LP, as amended (the “Partnership
Agreement”), common OP unit holders received the cash distribution of 10% of the $0.25 per



share dividend paid by Host to its common stockholders, or $0.025 per OP unit, but did not receive an equivalent per unit distribution for the 90% of the dividend paid with Host common stock.
Therefore, subsequent to the issuance of shares of common stock to stockholders of Host, the conversion factor used to convert OP units into shares of Host common stock was adjusted from 1.0 to 1.021494, so that upon redemption, to the extent Host
exercises its right to provide payment of the redemption price with shares of Host common stock, each OP unit may now be redeemed for 1.021494 shares of Host common stock. The above adjustment to the conversion factor was made to avoid any
unintended dilution as a result of the portion of Host’s dividend paid with shares of its common stock to its stockholders.

Investors should take into account the 2% non-controlling position of Host LP common OP units when analyzing common and preferred dividend payments by Host to its stockholders, as these holders share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being
distributed by Host LP to holders of its corresponding common and preferred OP units. For example, if Host paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on payment of a $1.021494 per common unit distribution by Host LP to Host,
as well as to other common OP unit holders. Additionally, when Host pays a preferred dividend, Host LP pays an equivalent per unit distribution on its preferred OP units.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

We are party to various transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities (which we refer to as “off-balance sheet
arrangements”) under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees. As of December 31, 2009, we are party to the following material off-balance sheet arrangements:

Unconsolidated Investments

.    In March 2006, we formed a joint venture, HHR Euro CV, to acquire hotels in
Europe. We serve as the general partner for the European joint venture and have a 32.1% ownership interest (including our general and limited partner interests). Due to the ownership structure and the non-Host limited partners’ rights to cause
the dissolution and liquidation of the European joint venture at any time, it is not consolidated in our financial statements. Our investment balance at December 31, 2009 in the joint venture is approximately €96 million
($138 million), which includes the effect of the impairment of the investment recorded in 2009 (described below).

As of
December 31, 2009, the aggregate size of the European joint venture was approximately €1.1 billion ($1.6 billion), including total capital contributions of approximately €448 million ($602 million), of which a
total of approximately €142 million ($190 million) was from our contribution of cash and the Sheraton Warsaw Hotel & Towers. Under the joint venture’s partnership agreement, the aggregate size of the European joint
venture can increase to approximately €540 million of equity (of which approximately €170 million would be contributed by Host LP) and, once all funds have been invested, would represent approximately €1.5 billion of
assets.

The European joint venture has €718 million in mortgage debt, none of which is recourse to us, and all of
which either has, or has the potential to trigger covenant defaults, cash sweeps or non-payment defaults. The European joint venture has initiated discussions with the lenders of mortgage loans totaling €414 million that are due in 2013
and 2014 that have breached financial covenants. These loans are secured by nine properties in total, comprising one portfolio of six hotels located in Spain, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom and one portfolio of three hotels located in
Brussels. Each portfolio is cross-collateralized, meaning that a default under one loan in the portfolio could trigger a default on the loans for the other properties in the portfolio. The joint venture has the right to cure certain covenants,
including debt service coverage and loan-to-value covenants, a limited number of times by making cash deposits. If discussions with the lenders are unsuccessful, and the European joint venture does not elect to cure the defaults, the lenders may,
among other remedies, accelerate the loans. These mortgage loans are non-recourse to Host and our partners and a default under these loans does not trigger a default under any of Host’s debt.



The terms of this joint venture agreement limit the life of the investment to 2016, with two
one-year extensions. During the second quarter, we determined that our investment was impaired based on the reduction of distributable cash flows from the joint venture, which has been caused primarily by a decline in cash flows generated by the
properties. We believe this impairment to be other-than-temporary as defined by GAAP because the time period over which the joint venture may be able to improve operations such that our investment would be fully recoverable is constrained by the
remaining life of the joint venture. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge totaling $34 million during 2009 based on the difference between the estimated fair value of our investment and its carrying value. This impairment is
included in equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations. See “-Critical Accounting Policies—

Other-than-Temporary Impairment of an Investment

” and Note 3, “Investments in
Affiliates,” in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

During 2008, we entered into three foreign currency
forward purchase contracts to hedge approximately 50% of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the European joint venture. We hedged €60 million (approximately $88 million) of
our investment and the forward purchase will occur between August 2011 and May 2014. During 2009 and 2008, we recorded approximately $(4) million and $6 million, respectively related to the change in the fair value of the forward purchase contracts.
The current value of the forward contracts of $2 million is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheet. The derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a
foreign operation, and, in accordance with SFAS 133, are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the stockholders’ equity portion of our balance sheet. For additional detail on
the foreign currency forward purchase contracts and our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”

On March 25, 2008, we entered into a joint venture, structured as a Singapore Corporation, to explore investment opportunities in
various markets throughout Asia, including India, China and Japan, and Australia (the “Asian joint venture”). We own a 25% interest in the Asian joint venture. The initial term of the Asian joint venture is for a period of seven years. Due
to the ownership structure of the Asian joint venture, and our partner’s rights to cause the dissolution and liquidation of the Asian joint venture at any time, it is not consolidated in our financial statements. Currently, the Asian joint
venture does not own any hotels. We are currently the asset manager for two third-party owned hotel properties in Asia in exchange for fees, and we are seeking additional asset management opportunities in Asia.

Tax Sharing Arrangements

.    Under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies (such as Marriott
International, HMS Host and Barceló Crestline Corporation), we are obligated to pay certain taxes (federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated
with us. For example, a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us. This adjustment could produce a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax
sharing agreement. Additionally, under the partnership agreement between Host and Host LP, Host LP is obligated to pay certain taxes (federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) incurred by Host, as well as any
liabilities the IRS may successfully assert against Host. We do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing arrangements to be material.

Tax Indemnification Agreements.

For reasons relating to federal and state income tax considerations of the former and current owners of three hotels, we have agreed to
restrictions on selling the hotels, or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel. Two of these agreements will expire in 2010 and the third will expire in 2028.



Guarantees

.    We have certain guarantees, which consist of
commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt, that are not on our books due to various dispositions, spin-offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an
unrelated party. We consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote. The largest guarantees (by dollar amount) are listed below:

•

We remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non-lodging properties. These primarily represent certain divested restaurants
that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments. The aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately $20 million as of December 31, 2009.

•

In 1997, we owned Leisure Park Venture Limited Partnership, which owns and operates a senior living facility. We no longer have an ownership interest
in the partnership, but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to $14.7 million of municipal bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority through their maturity in 2027. However, to the
extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee, we have been indemnified by Barceló Crestline Corporation, who, in turn, is indemnified by the current owner of the facility.

•

In connection with the sale of two hotels in January 2005, we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases. The
future minimum lease payments are approximately $13 million through the full term of the leases, including renewal options. We believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote, and in each case, we have been indemnified by
the purchaser of the hotel.

Information on other guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements may be
found in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.

Contractual Obligations.

The
table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt, future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases, projected capital expenditures and other long-term liabilities, each as of
December 31, 2009 (in millions):

(1)

The amounts shown include amortization of principal, debt maturities and estimated interest payments. Interest payments have been included in the long-term debt
obligations based on the weighted average interest rate.

(2)

The less than one year obligations include $346 million of our Series M senior notes and the $124 million mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis, which were
repaid on January 20, 2010, and February 11, 2010, respectively.

(3)

Future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the HPT subleases of approximately $7 million and
$198 million, respectively, payable to us under non-cancelable subleases.

(4)

Our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels. Under our contracts, we have the ability to defer some of these
expenditures into later years.

(5)

The amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense. Under terms of our management agreements, we have deferred payment of
management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owner’s priority to us. The timing of the payments, if any, is based on future operations, the termination of
the management agreement or the sale of the hotel, and, is therefore, not determinable. The estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years.



Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially
different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including
those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies
are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates.

Purchase Price Allocations to Hotels

.

Investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition
cost and allocated to land, property and equipment, identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value. Any remaining unallocated acquisition costs would be treated as goodwill. Property and equipment are recorded at
fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties. Identifiable
intangible assets are typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements, which are recorded at fair value, although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms. Above-market and
below-market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over
the period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the contract. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable term of the related agreements. In making estimates of fair values for purposes
of allocating purchase price, we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data, including third-party appraisals and valuations.

Impairment Testing.

We analyze our assets for impairment throughout the year when events or
circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and, as a result, recorded $97 million of property impairments in the first and second quarters of 2009. We consider a property to be impaired when the sum of future
undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset. For impaired assets, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the property’s carrying value over its fair value. To
the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life, it would be unusual for undiscounted
cash flows to be insufficient to recover the property’s carrying value. In the absence of other factors, we assume that the estimable life is equal to the GAAP depreciable life, because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement
capital expenditures required under our management agreements. We adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise, such as an expiring ground lease, or it is more likely than not that
the asset will be sold prior to its previously expected useful life.

We test for impairment in several situations, including
when a property has current or projected loss from operations, when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when other events, trends, contingencies or changes in
circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the impairment of our assets, we make many assumptions and estimates, including:

•

projected cash flows, both from operations and the eventual disposition;

•

expected useful life and holding period;

•

future required capital expenditures; and

•

fair values, including consideration of capitalization rates, discount rates and comparable selling prices.



While we consider all of the above indicators, as a preliminary indicator to determine if
the carrying value may not be recovered by undiscounted cash flows, we reviewed the actual year-to-date and the projected cash flows from operations to identify properties with actual or projected annual operating losses or minimal operating profit
as of December 31, 2009. The projected cash flows are prepared by our third-party managers and consider items such as booking pace, occupancy, room rate and property-level operating costs. We review the projections and may adjust them as we
deem appropriate. As a result of our review, we identified 16 properties that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. We
assumed a 2.5% rate of growth of projected cash flows over the estimated useful life of the individual properties, which growth rate was adjusted lower than the historical growth rate in order to reflect the current economic climate. Management
considered a range of RevPAR and operating margin declines compared to the prior year operating results in evaluating the projected cash flows from operations. Based on this test, no properties exhibited an impaired value at December 31, 2009.
For purposes of this test, if we had assumed a growth rate of 0%, two of the 16 properties identified above would have required further analysis, including testing the property using a probability weighted undiscounted cash flow analysis. Management
believes its assumptions and estimates reflect current market conditions. Management will adjust these measures as appropriate for changes therein in future periods and we could incur additional impairment changes if economic conditions continue to
remain weak.

Other-than-Temporary Impairment of an Investment.

We review our equity
method investments for other-than-temporary impairment based on the occurrence of any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an other-than-temporary basis. Triggering events can
include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment, a change in the expected useful life or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment. Our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel
properties; therefore, we will generally have few observable inputs and will determine the fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment, as well as considering the impact of other elements (i.e. control premiums, etc.). We
use certain inputs, such as available third-party appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties, to estimate the expected cash flows. If an equity method investment is impaired, a loss is recorded for the difference between
the fair value and the carrying value of the investment.

Classification of Assets as “Held for
Sale”.

Our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable, will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale
are unlikely to change or that the planned sale will be withdrawn. This policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are
executed, the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner. Specifically, we will typically classify properties that we are actively
marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met:

•

our Board of Directors has approved the sale (to the extent the dollar amount of the sale requires Board approval);

•

a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed;

•

the buyer has committed a significant amount of non-refundable cash; and

•

no significant contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner.

To the extent a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the
property, we will record an impairment loss. See the discussion above concerning the use of estimates and judgments in determining fair values for impairment tests.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense.

Depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is
the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. The lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and



timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets, as well as specific market and economic conditions. While management believes its estimates are reasonable, a change in the
estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income (loss) or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels.

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets.

We have approximately $71 million, net of a valuation allowance of $37 million, of consolidated deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009. The objective
of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in a company’s financial statements or tax returns. We have considered various factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining
a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the $71 million of deferred tax assets in the future. When a determination is made that all, or a portion, of the
deferred tax assets may not be realized, an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period.

Valuation
of Derivative Contracts.

We will occasionally enter into derivative products including interest rate and foreign currency swaps, caps and collars. Derivative instruments are subject to fair value reporting at each
reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income (loss) or accumulated other comprehensive income, based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance. We estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use
of third party valuations, which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own
nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting
any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. The variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and
exchange rate curves. The values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change. Any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact
our valuations. The fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity.

Stock Compensation.

We recognize costs resulting from our share-based payment transactions in our
financial statements over their vesting periods. We classify share-based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity awards or liability awards. The classification of our restricted stock awards as either an equity
award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options. Equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. Liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. The value of these
restricted stock awards, less estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award – the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation
cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service. These awards were classified as liability awards due to settlement features that allowed the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards
withheld to meet tax requirements in excess of the minimum required by tax statutes.

During 2009, we implemented a new
employee stock plan for our senior management that included the following awards:

Restricted stock awards with vesting
based on market conditions.

These awards are classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement features. Therefore, they are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. We utilize a simulation, or Monte Carlo
model, to determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions. The utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock,
risk-free interest rates, the risk profile of our common shares compared to our peer group and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited.



Restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance
conditions.

These awards are earned based on an employee’s achieving a specified performance target, which will be based on the employee’s specific management business objectives. Compensation cost will be
recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable of achievement. If a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable of achievement, recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition
that is the most likely outcome. These awards are also considered liability awards due to the cash-settlement provisions. Therefore, the value of the shares to be issued will be based on the share price on the reporting date.

Stock option awards.

The stock option awards are equity awards, as they do not include cash settlement
features. Therefore, the value of the award is determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and is not adjusted for future changes in the fair value. Vesting for these awards is based on service conditions. The utilization of the
binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited.

Other awards.

During 2009, we granted restricted stock awards to all of our employees with vesting based on
service conditions. These awards are equity classified awards as they do not have an option for excess tax withholding similar to that for awards to senior management.

Consolidation Policies.

Judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the evaluation of control, including
assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights, as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests. We have investments in entities that own hotel properties and other
investments which we record using the equity method of accounting. These entities are considered to be voting interest entities. The debt on these investments is non-recourse to us and the effect of their operations on our results of operations is
not material. While we do not believe we are required to consolidate any of our current partnerships or joint ventures presented under the equity method, if we were required to do so, then all of the results of operations and the assets and
liabilities would be included in our financial statements.

Application of New Accounting Standards.

Business Combinations.

This new accounting pronouncement provides principles on the recognition and
measurement of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination. The pronouncement particularly requires the assets acquired, liabilities assumed
and non-controlling interests to be measured at the acquisition date fair value, including contingent considerations. Furthermore, the pronouncement prohibits acquisition-related costs, such as due diligence, legal and accounting fees, from being
applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets. We adopted the provisions of this pronouncement on January 1, 2009. We do not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will materially affect the recognition and measurement
related to our future business combinations.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.

The
FASB recently amended its guidance surrounding a company’s analysis to determine whether any of its variable interests constitute controlling financial interests in a variable interest entity. This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of
a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics:

•

The power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance.

•

The obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits
from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity.

Additionally, an
enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the



activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. The new guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009 and, accordingly, we will reevaluate our interests in variable interest entities for the
period beginning on January 1, 2010 to determine that the entities are reflected properly in the financial statements as investments or consolidated entities. We do not anticipate that the implementation of this guidance will have any material
effect on our financial statements.

Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics

We present certain operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses
and adjusted operating profit) for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis. We define our comparable hotels as properties (i) that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated
results, whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and (ii) that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large-scale
capital projects during the reporting periods being compared.

All of the 111 hotels that we owned on December 31, 2009
have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the eight hotels we disposed of in 2009 and 2008 are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein. Moreover, because these statistics and operating
results are for our hotel properties, they exclude results for our non-hotel properties and other real estate investments.

We
evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type. These divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry.

Geographic regions consist of the following (only states in which we own hotels are listed):

•

Pacific—California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington;

•

Mountain—Arizona and Colorado;

•

North Central—Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio;

•

South Central—Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas;

•

New England—Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire;

•

Mid-Atlantic—Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York;

•

DC Metro—Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.;

•

Atlanta—Georgia and North Carolina;

•

Florida—Florida; and

•

International—Canada, Mexico and Chile.

Property types consist of the following:

•

Urban—Hotels located in primary business districts of major cities;

•

Suburban—Hotels located in office parks or smaller secondary markets;

•

Resort/conference—Hotels located in resort/conference destinations such as Arizona, Florida, Hawaii and Southern California; and

•

Airport—Hotels located at or near airports.



Reporting Periods.

For Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to
us by our hotel managers. Our hotel managers use different reporting periods. Marriott, the manager of a significant percentage of our properties, uses a year ending on the Friday closest to December 31 and reports twelve weeks of operations
for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its Marriott-managed hotels. In contrast, other managers of our hotels, such as Hyatt and Starwood, report results on a monthly basis. Host, as a
REIT, is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year. As a result, we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by Marriott modified so that our fiscal year always ends on December 31 to comply with REIT rules. Our
first three quarters of operations end on the same day as Marriott but our fourth quarter ends on December 31 and our full year results, as reported in our statement of operations, always includes the same number of days as the calendar year.

Two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are: (1) quarterly start dates will usually differ between
years, except for the first quarter which always commences on January 1, and (2) our first and fourth quarters of operations and year-to-date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years. For example, set
forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for 2010, 2009 and 2008. Note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations. In contrast, the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations.

While the reporting
calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by Marriott, another consequence of our calendar is we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter-end until the following quarter
because our hotel managers using a monthly reporting period do not make mid-month results available to us. Hence, the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter-end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following
quarter for those hotel managers (covering approximately 43% of total revenues of our hotels). As a result, our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows: first quarter
(January, February), second quarter (March to May), third quarter (June to August) and fourth quarter (September to December). While this does not affect full year results, it does affect the reporting of quarterly results.

For Hotel Operating Statistics and Comparable Hotel Results.

In contrast to the reporting periods for our
consolidated statement of operations, our hotel operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and our comparable hotel results are reported based on the reporting cycle used by Marriott for our Marriott-managed
hotels. However, for years such as 2008, where Marriott reports its operations based on a 53-week year and a fourth quarter of 17 weeks, for comparable purposes, we exclude the extra week of operations, and we still reflect 52 weeks for the full
year and 16 weeks for the fourth quarter. This facilitates year-to-year comparisons, as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year. This means, however, that the reporting periods we use for
hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results will typically differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year. Set forth below are the quarterly start
and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein. Results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent
with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations.



Hotel Result Reporting Periods for Operating Statistics

and Comparable Hotel Results—for Marriott Managed Properties

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical financial performance that are
not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO per diluted share, and (ii) Comparable Hotel Operating Results. The following discussion defines these terms and
presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance.

FFO Per Diluted
Share.

We present FFO per diluted share as a non-GAAP measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate FFO per diluted share for a given operating
period as our FFO (defined as set forth below) for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales
of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is presented on a per share basis after making
adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities, including the payment of preferred stock dividends, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines.

We believe that FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of
earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be
of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe that such a measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs, even though FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that
accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its April 2002 “White Paper on
Funds From Operations,” since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting
to be insufficient by themselves. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the definition of FFO in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

We calculate FFO per diluted share, in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or
calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although FFO per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. This
information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and
replacement capital expenditures) and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded
items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include depreciation, capital expenditures and other excluded items, all of which
should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial



measures. FFO per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.
In addition, FFO per diluted share does not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to our stockholders’ benefit.

The following tables provide a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders per share to FFO per diluted share (in millions, except per share amounts):

Reconciliation of Net Income Available to

Common Stockholders to Funds From Operations per Diluted Share

(a)

In accordance with the guidance on FFO per diluted share provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, we do not adjust net income for the
non-cash impairment charges when determining our FFO per diluted share.

(b)

FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT is adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive
stock plans, preferred OP Units held by non-controlling partners, exchangeable debt securities and other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interest to common OP Units. No effect is shown for
securities if they are anti-dilutive.

(c)

During the first quarter of 2009 and fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased $75 million and $100 million face amount, respectively, of the 2004 Debentures
with a carrying value of $72 million and $96 million for $69 million and $82 million, respectively. The adjustments to dilutive FFO related to the 2004 Debentures repurchased during the year include the $3 million and
$14 million gain on repurchase in 2009 and 2008, respectively, net of interest expense on the repurchased debentures.



(d)

FFO per diluted share and earnings per diluted share were significantly affected by certain transactions, the effects of which are shown in the table below (in
millions, except per share amounts):

(1)

Includes the accrual of a potential litigation loss in the fourth quarter of 2009.

(2)

Includes gains/losses associated with the repurchase of our 2007 Debentures and the repayment of the term loan. Additionally, as prescribed by the sharing agreement
with the successor borrower in connection with the 2007 defeasance of a $514 million collateralized mortgage-backed securities, we received $7 million and recorded the gain as a reduction of interest expense in the second quarter 2009. The
loan had an initial maturity date of September 15, 2009, and was prepayable beginning on May 1, 2009. We had been legally released from all obligations under the loan upon the defeasance in 2007.

(3)

Represents the portion of the significant items attributable to non-controlling partners of Host LP.

(e)

FFO per diluted share and loss per diluted share include a $12 million tax benefit, or $.02 per common share, related to the reversal of an excess deferred tax
liability that was established in prior periods associated with our investment in CBM JV, which was sold on September 11, 2009.

Comparable Hotel Operating Results.

We present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, and adjusted operating profit, on a
comparable hotel, or “same store” basis as supplemental information for investors. We present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate-level costs and expenses related to our capital structure, as well as
depreciation and amortization. We eliminate corporate-level costs and expenses to arrive at property-level results because we believe property-level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our
hotels. We eliminate depreciation and amortization, because even though depreciation and amortization are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that
the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for
real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.

As a result of the elimination of
corporate-level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used
to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our
consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period
performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to
growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors, such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions. While management believes



that presentation of comparable hotel results is a “same store” supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to
allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results. For these reasons, we believe that comparable hotel operating
results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.

The following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable hotels for the periods presented herein:

Comparable Hotel Results

(in millions, except hotel
statistics)

(a)

The reconciliation of total revenues per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable hotel sales is as follows:

(b)

The reconciliation of operating costs per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable hotel expenses is as follows:



(c)

Non-comparable hotel results, net, includes the following items: (i) the results of operations of our non-comparable hotels whose operations are included in our
consolidated statements of operations as continuing operations and (ii) the difference between the number of days of operations reflected in the comparable hotel results and the number of days of operations reflected in the consolidated
statements of operations.

(d)

Represents rental income less rental expense for select service properties and office buildings.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Our future income, cash flows and fair values
relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Currently, we have no derivative financial instruments held for
trading purposes. We use derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks.

Currently, our interest
payments on 88% of our debt are fixed in nature (this percentage does not include $300 million of mortgage debt for which we have swapped fixed interest payments for floating interest payments), which largely mitigates the effect of changes in
interest rates on our cash interest payments. Valuations for mortgage debt and the credit facility are determined based on the expected future payments, discounted at risk-adjusted rates. Senior notes and the exchangeable senior debentures are
valued based on quoted market prices. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by 100 basis points, interest expense would increase or decrease, respectively, our future earnings and cash flows by approximately
$7 million in 2010.

The table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by
expected maturity dates.

(1)

The 2010 maturities include $346 million of our Series M senior notes and the $124 million mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis, which were repaid on
January 20, 2010, and February 11, 2010, respectively. After these repayments, 2010 debt maturities total $334 million.

(2)

The amounts are net of unamortized discounts and premiums.

(3)

The interest rate for our floating rate payments is based on the rate in effect as of December 31, 2009. No adjustments are made for forecasted changes in the
rate.

Fair Value Interest Rate Hedges.

During 2009, we entered into three
interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount totaling $300 million related to The Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa mortgage loan in the amount of $300 million. We entered into the derivative
instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of the fixed-rate mortgage that occur as a result of changes in the 3-month LIBOR rate. As a result, we will pay a floating interest rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR, plus a spread which ranges from 2.7%
to 3.2%, as opposed to the fixed rate of 5.531%, on the notional amount of $300 million through March 1, 2014. We have designated these derivatives as fair value hedges. The derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield



curve on the date of measurement. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps. As of December 31, 2009, we recorded a liability of
$1 million related to the fair value of the swaps. At the same time, we record the change in the fair value of the underlying debt due to change in the 3-month LIBOR rate as a reduction to the carrying amount of the debt, or $.7 million,
at December 31, 2009. The difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship. We recognized a loss of
$.3 million related to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship in 2009. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized as gains/losses on derivatives.

Interest Rate Cap Derivative.

In connection with the mortgage debt secured by the JW Marriott,
Washington, D.C., we entered into an interest rate cap agreement which caps the LIBOR rate at 3% through the life of the loan. At December 31, 2009, the variable interest rate on the loan was 7.5% and the fair value of the cap was
$1.8 million. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the cap. We recognized a gain of $.3 million based on the changes in the fair value of the derivative during the year. Changes in the fair value of
these instruments are recognized as gains/losses on derivatives.

Exchange Rate Sensitivity

As we have non-U.S. operations (specifically, the ownership of hotels in Canada, Mexico and Chile and an investment in our European joint
venture), currency exchange risk arises as a normal part of our business. To manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non-U.S. hotels, where possible, we may enter into forward or option contracts. The foreign currency exchange
agreements that we have entered into were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes.

During 2008,
we entered into three foreign currency forward purchase contracts totaling €60 million (approximately $88 million) to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in
the European joint venture. Pursuant to these transactions, we will sell the Euro amount, and receive the U.S. Dollar amount on the forward purchase date. These derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net
investment in a foreign operation and are marked-to-market with changes in fair value and recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the equity portion of our balance sheet. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation
of the fair value of the swaps. The following table summarizes our three foreign currency purchase contracts (in millions):

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.:

We have audited Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)

.

Host
Hotels & Resorts, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Item 9a

Controls and Procedures - Internal Control over Financial Reporting

of Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates. If we
determine that we are an owner in a variable interest entity and that our variable interest will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns if they occur,
or both, then we will consolidate the entity. Additionally, we consolidate entities (in the absence of other factors determining control) when we own over 50% of the voting shares or, in the case of partnership investments, when we own a majority of
the general partnership interest and can control the entity. The control factors we consider include the ability of non-controlling interests to participate in or block management decisions. All material intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash includes reserves for debt service, real estate taxes, insurance, furniture, fixtures and equipment, as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits due to mortgage debt agreement restrictions and provisions. For
purposes of the statements of cash flows, changes in restricted cash that are used for furniture, fixture and equipment replacement funds controlled by our lenders are shown as investing activities. The remaining changes in restricted cash are the
direct result of restrictions under our loan agreements, and, as such, are reflected in cash from financing activities.



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table represents our restricted cash balances as of December 31, 2009
and 2008, which are restricted as a result of lender requirements (in millions):

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost. For newly developed properties, cost includes interest and real estate taxes incurred during
development and construction. Replacements and improvements and capital leases are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, generally 40 years for buildings and three to ten years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets.

We capitalize certain inventory (such as china, glass, silver, linen) at the time of a hotel opening, or when significant inventory is
purchased (in conjunction with a major rooms renovation or when the number of rooms or meeting space at a hotel is expanded). These amounts are then amortized over the estimated useful life of three years. Subsequent replacement purchases are
expensed when placed in service.

We maintain a furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement fund for renewal and replacement
capital expenditures at certain hotels, which is generally funded with approximately 5% of property revenues.

We analyze our
assets for impairment when events or circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We consider a property to be impaired when the sum of future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is
less than the carrying value of the asset. We test for impairment in several situations, including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations, when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its
previously estimated useful life, or when other events, trends, contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. For impaired assets, we record an
impairment charge equal to the excess of the property’s carrying value over its fair value. In the evaluation of the impairment of our assets, we make many assumptions and estimates, including assumptions on the projected cash flows, both from
operations and the eventual disposition, the expected useful life and holding period of the asset, the future required capital expenditures and fair values, including consideration of capitalization rates, discount rates and comparable selling
prices.

We will classify a hotel as held for sale when the sale of the asset is probable, will be completed within one year
and actions to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the sale will be withdrawn. Accordingly, we typically classify assets as held for sale when our Board of Directors has approved the sale, a binding agreement



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

to purchase the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant financing contingencies exist which could prevent the
transaction from being completed in a timely manner. If these criteria are met, we will record an impairment loss if the fair value less costs to sell is lower than the carrying amount of the hotel and will cease recording depreciation. We will
classify the loss, together with the related operating results, including interest expense on debt assumed by the buyer or that is required to be repaid as a result of the sale, as discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of operations
and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet. Gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of sale or deferred and recognized as income in subsequent periods as conditions requiring deferral are
satisfied or expire without further cost to us.

We recognize the fair value of any liability for conditional asset retirement
obligations including environmental remediation liabilities when incurred, which is generally upon acquisition, construction, or development and/or through the normal operation of the asset, if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate
the fair value of the obligation.

Intangible Assets

In conjunction with our acquisition of hotel properties, we may identify intangible assets. Identifiable intangible assets are typically
contracts, including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements, which are recorded at fair value, although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms. These contract values are based on the present
value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of
the contract. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable term of the related agreements.

Non-Controlling Interests

Host LP.

We
adjust the non-controlling interests of Host LP each period so that the amount presented equals the greater of its carrying value based on the accumulated historical cost or its redemption value. The historical cost is based on the proportional
relationship between the historical cost of equity held by our common stockholders relative to that of the unitholders of Host LP. The redemption value is based on the amount of cash or Host stock, at our option, that would be paid to the
non-controlling interests of the operating partnership if the partnership were terminated. Therefore, we have assumed that the redemption value is equivalent to the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the outside OP Units valued at the
market price of Host common stock at the balance sheet date. Subsequent to the stock dividend issued in 2009 (see Note 4 – Equity), one OP unit may now be exchanged into 1.021494 shares of Host common stock. At year end 2008, outside OP Units
were exchangeable for Host common shares on a one-for-one basis. The table below details the historical cost and redemption values for the non-controlling interests (in millions):

(1)

The book value recorded is equal to the greater of the redemption value or the historical cost.



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Net income (loss) is allocated to the non-controlling interests of Host LP based on
their weighted average ownership percentage during the period.

Other Consolidated
Partnerships.

As of December 31, 2009, we consolidate three majority-owned partnerships with mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests with finite lives ranging from 99 to 100 years that terminate between
2081 and 2095. Third party partnership interests that have finite lives are included in non-controlling interests-other consolidated partnerships in the consolidated balance sheets and totaled $22 million and $24 million as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair values of the non-controlling interests in these partnerships were approximately $44 million and $66 million, respectively. As of December 31,
2009, none of our partnerships have infinite lives as defined by GAAP.

Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling
interests of Host LP and of other non-controlling consolidated partnerships is not included in the determination of net income (loss). However, net income (loss) has been reduced by the amount attributable to non-controlling interests, which totaled
($6) million, $19 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in the determination of net income (loss) attributable to Host.

Distributions from Investments in Affiliates

We classify the distributions from our equity investments in the statements of cash flows based upon an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances of each distribution to determine its nature. For
example, distributions from cash generated by property operations are classified as cash flows from operating activities. However, distributions received as a result of property sales would be classified as cash flows from investing activities.

Other-than-Temporary Impairments

We review our equity method investments for other-than-temporary impairment based on the occurrence of any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair
value on an other-than-temporary basis. Triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment, a change in the expected useful life or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment. Our
investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties; therefore, we will generally have few observable inputs and will determine the fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment, as well as considering
the impact of other elements (i.e. control premiums, etc.). We use certain inputs such as available third-party appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties to estimate the expected cash flows. If an equity method investment
is impaired, a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment.

Income
Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and, as such, are
not subject to federal income tax, provided we distribute all of our taxable income annually to our stockholders and comply with certain other requirements. In addition to paying federal and state income tax on any retained income, we are subject to
taxes on “built-in-gains” on sales of certain assets. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and foreign income tax. The consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related
to the operations of the taxable REIT subsidiaries, state income taxes incurred by Host and Host LP and foreign income taxes incurred by Host LP, as well as each of their respective subsidiaries.



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the
year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. However, deferred
tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable
income and tax planning strategies.

Deferred Charges

Financing costs related to long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method.

Foreign Currency Translation

As of December 31, 2009, our foreign operations consist of four properties located in Canada, one property located in Mexico, two in Chile, an investment in a joint venture in Europe and an
investment in a joint venture in Asia. The operations of these properties and our investments are maintained in their functional currency, which is generally the local currency, and then translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates
for the period. The assets and liabilities of the properties and the investment are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other
comprehensive income.

Derivative Instruments

We are subject to market exposures in several aspects of our business including foreign currency exposure related to our investment in the
European joint venture, our consolidated international hotels, interest rate exposure for the interest payments for our floating rate debt and the fair value of our fixed rate debt. We may, from time to time, enter into derivative instruments to
either protect against fluctuations in the fair value of our investments in foreign entities or the fair value of our debt instruments. Prior to entering into the derivative contract, we evaluate whether the transaction would qualify for hedge
accounting and continue to evaluate hedge effectiveness through the life of the contract. Gains and losses on contracts that meet the requirements for fair value hedge accounting are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with offsetting
changes recorded to net income (loss) or accumulated other comprehensive income, based on the applicable accounting guidance. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective
counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements, such
as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.

In situations where we have floating rate debt, we may
purchase interest rate swaps or interest rate caps, which would be considered derivative instruments. If the requirements for hedge accounting are met and the instruments qualify as cash flow hedges, amounts paid or received under these agreements
would be recognized over the life of the agreements as adjustments to interest expense, and the fair value of the derivatives would be recorded on the accompanying balance sheet, with offsetting adjustments or charges recorded to accumulated other
comprehensive income.

The components of total accumulated other comprehensive income in the balance sheets are as follows (in millions):

Our consolidated results of operations reflect revenues and expenses of our hotels. Revenues are recognized when the services are provided. Additionally, we collect sales, use, occupancy and similar taxes
at our hotels which we present on a net basis (excluded from revenues) on our statements of operations.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders as adjusted for potentially dilutive securities, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
plus other potentially dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans, other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interests to common OP units and
convertible debt securities. No effect is shown for any securities that are anti-dilutive.

(1)

During 2009 and 2008, we repurchased $75 million and $100 million face amount, respectively, of our $500 million 3


/


% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (the “2004
Debentures”) with a carrying value of $72 million and $96 million for approximately $69 million and $82 million, respectively. We are required to determine the dilutive effect of the repurchased 2004 Debentures separately
from the 2004 Debentures outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008. The 2004 Debentures repurchased during 2009 and 2008 are treated as having been converted to common stock equivalents at the start of the period. Accordingly, the 2009 and 2008
adjustments to net income related to the repurchased 2004 Debentures include a $3 million and $14 million gain, respectively, net of interest expense on the repurchased debentures.

(2)

There are 51 million potentially dilutive shares for our Exchangeable Senior Debentures and shares granted under comprehensive stock plans which were not included
in the computation of diluted EPS as of December 31, 2009 because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the period. See Note 4—Debt for the terms and conditions of our Exchangeable Senior Debentures and Note 8—“Employee
Stock Plans” for the terms and conditions of our comprehensive stock plans.

Accounting for Share-Based
Payments

At December 31, 2009, we maintained two stock-based employee compensation plans, which are accounted for in
accordance with GAAP. See Note 8, “—Employee Stock Plans.”

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions, access to our credit facility, and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts. At December 31, 2009, our exposure risk related to
our derivative contracts totaled $3.4 million and the counterparties are investment grade financial institutions. Our credit risk exposure with regard to our cash and the $600 million available under our credit facility is spread among a
diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.

Application of New Accounting Standards

Business Combinations.

This new accounting pronouncement provides principles on the recognition and
measurement of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination. The pronouncement particularly requires the assets acquired, liabilities assumed
and non-controlling interests to be measured at the acquisition date fair value, including contingent considerations. Furthermore, the pronouncement prohibits acquisition-related costs, such as due diligence, legal and accounting fees, from being
capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets. We adopted the provisions of this pronouncement on January 1, 2009. We do not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will materially affect the recognition and
measurement related to our future business combinations.

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities.

The FASB recently amended its guidance surrounding a company’s analysis to determine whether any of its variable interests constitute controlling financial interests in a variable interest entity. This
analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics:

•

The power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance.

•

The obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits
from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity.

Additionally, an
enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity
that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. The new guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The guidance is effective for the first
annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009 and, accordingly, we will reevaluate our interests in variable interest entities for the period beginning on January 1, 2010 to determine that the entities are reflected properly
in the financial statements as investments or consolidated entities. We do not anticipate that the implementation of this guidance will have any material effect on our financial statements.

Certain prior year financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

European Joint Venture

In March 2006, we formed a joint venture, HHR Euro CV, to acquire hotels in Europe (the “European joint venture”). We serve as the
general partner for the European joint venture and have a 32.1% ownership interest (including our limited and general partner interests). The initial term of the European joint venture is ten years, subject to two one-year extensions with partner
approval. As of December 31, 2009, five of the hotels owned by HHR Euro CV are leased to HHR TRS CV, an entity of which we also serve as a general partner and have a 9.8% ownership interest, including our general and limited partner interests.
Due to the ownership structure and the non-Host limited partners’ rights to cause the dissolution and liquidation of the European joint venture and HHR TRS CV at any time, they are not consolidated in our financial statements. As general
partner, we earn a management fee based on the amount of equity commitments and equity investments. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded approximately $6 million, $6 million and $5 million of management fees, respectively.

During 2008, we entered into three foreign currency forward purchase contracts totaling €60 million (approximately
$88 million) to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the European joint venture. These derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net
investment in a foreign operation, and, in accordance with SFAS 133, are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the stockholders’ equity portion of our balance sheet. We also
evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the derivatives. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments totaled $(4) million and $6 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are included in
other comprehensive income. The balance in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the foreign currency forward purchase contracts was $2 million and $6 million at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

Our unconsolidated investees assess impairment of real estate properties based on whether estimated undiscounted future cash
flows from each individual property are less than book value. If a property is impaired, a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and net book value of the hotel. In 2008, we recognized a charge of approximately $2 million
related to the impairment of one such property in equity in earnings of affiliates. We also review our investments for other-than-temporary impairment based on the occurrence of any events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the
investment exceeds its fair value on an other-than-temporary basis. During the second quarter of 2009, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge totaling $34 million in equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates based on the difference between
the estimated fair value of our investment and its carrying value. As of December 31, 2009, no further impairment was recorded. See “Note 12—Fair Value Measurements.”

Asian Joint Venture

On March 25, 2008, we entered into a joint venture, structured as a Singapore Corporation that will explore investment opportunities in various markets throughout Asia, including China, Japan, Vietnam, and India, as well as in
Australia (the “Asian joint venture”). We own a 25% interest in the joint venture, which has an initial term of seven years. Due to the ownership structure of the Asian joint venture and our partner’s rights to cause the dissolution
and liquidation of the joint venture, it is not consolidated in our financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, the Asian joint venture did not own any hotels.

CBM Joint Venture LP

CBM Joint Venture Limited Partnership (“CBM

this transaction, we no longer have any ownership interest in CBM JV.

Other Investments

We own a 49% limited partner interest in Tiburon Golf Ventures, L.P., which owns the golf club surrounding The Ritz-Carlton, Naples Golf

The assets securing mortgage debt represents the book value of real estate assets, net of accumulated depreciation. These amounts do not represent the current market
value of the assets.

Senior Notes

General.

Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, which includes our Exchangeable Senior Debentures, our
senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host LP’s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host LP. The face amount of our senior notes as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $4.7 billion
and $4.0 billion, respectively. The senior notes balance as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 includes discounts of approximately $145 million and $89 million, respectively. The notes under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed
by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes under our senior notes indenture, as well as our credit facility, certain other
senior debt, and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements, if any, with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. We pay interest on each series of our senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates
indicated on the table above.

We had the following activities during 2009 and 2008:

•

On December 22, 2009, Host LP issued $400 million of 2


/


% Exchangeable Senior Debentures and received proceeds of
$391 million, net of underwriting fees and expenses (the “2009 Debentures”). The proceeds, along with available cash, were used to redeem the remaining $346 million of the 7% Series M senior notes and to repay the $124 million
mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis in the first quarter of 2010. We separately account for the debt and equity portion of the debentures to reflect the



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

fair value of the liability component based on our non-convertible borrowing cost at the issuance date. Accordingly, we recorded the liability component of the debentures at a fair value of
$316 million which is based on an effective interest rate of 6.9% on December 16, 2009. We will amortize the resulting discount over the expected life of the debentures. See “2009 Exchangeable Senior Debentures” below.

•

During 2009, we repurchased approximately $74 million face amount of the 2


/


% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (the “2007 Debentures”)
with a carrying value of $68 million for $66 million and recorded a gain of approximately $2 million on the transactions. We have $526 million face amount of the 2007 Debentures outstanding.

•

On May 11, 2009, Host LP issued $400 million of 9% Series T senior notes maturing May 15, 2017 and received net proceeds of
approximately $380 million after discounts and underwriting fees and expenses. Interest on the Series T notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15, beginning July 15, 2009. A portion of the proceeds were
used to repay the $200 million outstanding on the revolver portion of our credit facility and the outstanding $135 million mortgage debt on the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa. The outstanding 9% Series T senior notes are equal in
right of payment with all of our other senior notes.

•

In the first quarter of 2009, we repurchased $75 million face amount of the 3


/


% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (the “2004 Debentures”)
with a carrying value of $72 million for approximately $69 million and recorded a gain on the repurchase of approximately $3 million. We have $325 million face amount of the 2004 Debentures outstanding.

•

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased $100 million face amount of the 2004 Debentures with a carrying value of $96 million for
approximately $82 million and recorded a gain of approximately $14 million.

The gains on the
repurchased debentures are recorded in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements. We evaluated the fair value of the debt repurchased based on the fair value of the cash flows at the date of the repurchase discounted at risk adjusted
rates. Based on this calculation, the fair value of the debt repurchased was generally greater than the conversion price; therefore, substantially all of the repurchase price was allocated to the debt portion of the debentures.

Restrictive Covenants.

Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, our ability to
incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0x by Host LP. Furthermore, Host LP is able to make
distributions to enable Host to pay dividends on its preferred stock under the senior notes indenture when our EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is above 1.7 to 1.0. This ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture
based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. For example, under the terms of our senior notes
indenture interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at
acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and approximately $27 million, $30 million and $25 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of non-cash interest expense related to our exchangeable debentures, all of
which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Our subsidiaries are subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture, however, in certain circumstances, we are permitted to designate certain subsidiaries as
unrestricted subsidiaries. These unrestricted subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants (unless they are guarantors) and may engage in transactions to dispose of or encumber their assets or otherwise incur additional



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

indebtedness without complying with the restrictive covenants in the indenture. If we were to designate additional subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, neither the EBITDA generated by
nor the interest expense allocated to these entities would be included in our ratio calculations. Other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total
assets (using undepreciated real estate values) excluding intangible assets and secured indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets. So long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in
the senior notes indenture, we may pay preferred or common dividends and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture, including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition. In addition, even if we are below the coverage levels
otherwise required to incur debt and pay dividends, we are still permitted to incur certain types of debt, including (i) credit facility debt, (ii) refinancing debt, (iii) up to $300 million of mortgage debt whose proceeds would
be used to repay debt under credit facility (and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount), and (iv) up to $100 million of other debt. Our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on
customary matters, such as our ability to pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our equity interests; make investments; permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries; sell assets; guarantee indebtedness; enter into
transactions with affiliates; create certain liens; and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. Our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets (as defined in the indenture as undepreciated
property value) of not less than 125% of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages. This coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur
debt or pay dividends discussed above (whose consequences, where we fall below the coverage level, are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or pay dividends, but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes
indenture).

We are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture. The following table
summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture as of December 31, 2009:

Exchangeable Debentures

We separately account for the liability and equity components of our exchangeable debentures to reflect the fair value of the liability
component based on our non-convertible borrowing cost at the issuance date. Accordingly, for the 2009 Debentures, 2007 Debentures and 2004 Debentures (collectively, the “Debentures”), we record the liability components of the Debentures at
fair value as of the date of issuance and amortize the resulting discount as an increase to interest expense over the expected life of the debt; however, there is no effect on our cash interest payments. We measured the fair value of the debt
components of the 2009 Debentures, 2007 Debentures and 2004 Debentures at issuance based on effective interest rates of 6.9%, 6.5% and 6.8%, respectively. As a result, we attributed $247 million of the proceeds received to the conversion
feature of the Debentures. This amount represents the excess proceeds received over the fair value of the debt at the date of issuance and is included in additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The following details
the initial allocations between the debt and equity components of the debentures, net of the original issue discount, based on the effective interest rate at the time of issuance, as well as the debt balances at December 31, 2009:

October 15, 2029 and are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year beginning on
January 15, 2010. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, the 2009 Debentures at any time on or after October 20, 2015 upon 15 days notice at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders have the right
to require us to repurchase the 2009 Debentures on October 15, 2015, October 15, 2019 and October 15, 2024 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders may exchange their 2009 Debentures prior to

two days prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption. On exchange, we must deliver cash, shares or a combination thereof at our option in an amount equal to the exchange value (which is the applicable exchange rate
multiplied by the average exchange price of our common shares). The exchange rate at December 31, 2009 was 71.0101 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, which is equivalent to an exchange price of

Debentures are not currently exchangeable.

2007 Exchangeable Senior
Debentures.

On March 23, 2007, Host LP issued $600 million of 2

% 2007 Debentures and received proceeds of $589 million, net of underwriting fees and expenses and original issue discount. During 2009, we repurchased approximately $74 million face amount of the 2007 Debentures for approximately $66
million. As of December 31, 2009, we have $526 million face amount of the 2007 Debentures that remain outstanding. The 2007 Debentures mature on April 15, 2027 and are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes. Interest
is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year beginning on July 15, 2007. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase the 2007 Debentures on April 15, 2012,
April 15, 2017 and April 15, 2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders may exchange their 2007 Debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions, including when the closing sale price of
Host’s common stock is more than 130% of the exchange price per share for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption. On
exchange, we must deliver cash in an amount equal to not less than the lower of the exchange value (which is the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the average price of our common shares) and the aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Debentures
to be exchanged, and, at our option, shares, cash or a combination thereof for any excess above the principal value. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, the 2007 Debentures at any time on or after April 20, 2012 upon 15 days notice at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. If we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures at the exchange
value described above rather than receive the cash redemption price. The exchange rate at December 31, 2009 was 32.0239 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, which is equivalent to an exchange price of $31.23 per
share of Host common stock. The exchange rate may be adjusted under certain circumstances including the payment of common dividends exceeding $.20 per share in any given quarter.

2009 was 65.3258 shares for each $1,000 of principal amount of the 2004 Debentures, or a total of approximately 21 million shares (which is equivalent to an exchange price of $15.31 per share). The exchange rate is adjusted for certain
circumstances, including the payment of common dividends. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, the 2004 Debentures at any time subsequent to April 19, 2009 upon 30 days notice at the applicable redemption price as set forth in the indenture.
If we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures for stock rather than receive the cash redemption price.

Authorization for Senior Notes and Exchangeable Debentures Repurchase

In May 2009, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $750 million of senior notes and exchangeable debentures. We may
purchase senior notes and exchangeable debentures through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt, if
any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings as a result of the payment of any applicable call
premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs. In February of 2010, this program was terminated with $680 million of remaining capacity, and a new $400 million program was authorized. This new program includes the
ability to repurchase senior notes, exchangeable debentures, mortgage debt and preferred stock.

Credit Facility

On May 25, 2007, we entered into a second amended and restated bank credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG New York
Branch, as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Citicorp North America Inc., Société Générale and Calyon New York Branch, as Co-Documentation Agents and certain other agents and lenders. The
credit facility provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of $600 million. During any period in which our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate
outstanding principal amount under the credit facility to exceed $300 million. The credit facility also includes subcommitments for (i) the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of $10 million and (ii) loans in
certain foreign currencies in an aggregate amount of $300 million, (A) $150 million of which may be loaned to certain of our Canadian subsidiaries in Canadian Dollars and (B) $300 million of which may be loaned to us in
Pounds Sterling and Euros. The credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of September 2011. We have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met as of September 2011. These conditions include the
payment of a fee to the lenders, that no default or event of default exists and maintaining a leverage ratio below 6.75x. Subject to certain conditions, we also have the option to increase the amount of the facility by up to $190 million to the
extent that any one or more lenders, whether or not currently party to the credit facility, commits to be a lender for such amount.

In the second quarter of 2008, we entered into a $210 million term loan under the credit facility. The term loan bore interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points, with a LIBOR floor of 2.25%. In the third quarter of 2009, we repaid the
entire $210 million term loan. In September 2008, we also borrowed $200 million under the revolver portion of our credit facility at a rate of LIBOR plus 65 basis points based on our leverage. During the second quarter of 2009, we repaid
the $200 million outstanding on the revolver portion of our credit facility. Based on our leverage at December 31, 2009, we have $600 million available under our credit facility.

The obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are currently secured by pledges of
equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The pledges are permitted to be released in the event that certain conditions are satisfied, including the requirement that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters. As a
result of having satisfied such conditions, currently we are not required to pledge our equity interests in any newly acquired or formed subsidiary, and at our election, we may obtain a release of all existing pledges for so long as our leverage
ratio continues to be below 6.0x. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility, as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are
parties to the credit facility.

Financial Covenants.

The credit facility contains
covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. Due to the decline in operations during the year, our unsecured



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio have declined and our leverage ratio has increased relative to year end 2008. We are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts
outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 7.25x and our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x. If our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to such amount as does
not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the credit facility to exceed $300 million. However, to the extent our borrowings under the credit facility revolver exceed $300 million on the date that our leverage ratio exceeds 7.0x,
we are not required to repay the excess for one year. The financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility. Hence, so long as there are no amounts outstanding, we would not be in default
if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants. These calculations are performed in accordance
with our credit facility based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. For example, under the terms
of the credit facility interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were
recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and approximately $27 million, $30 million and $25 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of interest expense recorded as a result of the adoption of a new
accounting pronouncement relating to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a
“net debt” concept under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million is deducted from our total debt balance.

We are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility. The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of December 31, 2009:

(a)

If at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will lower to 1.5x.

Interest and Fees.

We pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates
plus a margin that is set with reference to our leverage ratio. In the case of LIBOR borrowings in U.S. Dollars, as well as Euros and Pounds Sterling denominated borrowings, the rate of interest ranges from 65 basis points to 150 basis points over
LIBOR. We also have the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points and the Prime Lending Rate, plus, in both cases, the applicable spread ranging from 0 to 50 basis points. Based on our
leverage ratio at December 31, 2009 of 5.3x, we can borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 90 basis points or Prime plus 0 basis points. To the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused
portion of the loan commitment of 10 to 15 basis points, depending on our average revolver usage during the applicable period.

Other Covenants.

The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x. In particular, at
any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures, and the limitations on acquisitions, investments and dividends contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less
restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture. Additionally, the credit facility’s restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends are generally consistent with our senior notes



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

indenture. These provisions, under certain circumstances, limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing, and limit dividend payments to
those necessary to maintain our tax status as a REIT.

Mortgage Debt

All of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except for environmental liabilities, fraud, misapplication of funds and other
customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2009, we have 12 assets that are secured by mortgage debt with an average interest rate of 5.1% that mature between 2011 and 2023. As of December 31, 2009, we are in compliance with the
covenants under all of our mortgage debt obligations.

We had the following mortgage debt issuances and repayments since
January 2008. Interest for our mortgage debt is payable on a monthly basis:

(1)

The JW Marriott, Washington, D.C. mortgage debt has a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 600 basis points, with a LIBOR floor of 1.5%. The interest rate shown
reflects the rate in effect at December 31, 2009. Additionally, we have the right to extend the maturity for an additional one-year period, subject to certain conditions. In addition, as required by the loan agreement, we entered into an
interest rate cap agreement which caps the LIBOR rate at 3% through the life of the loan.

(2)

The Orlando World Center Marriott mortgage loan has a floating rate of interest of LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The interest rate shown reflects the rate in effect at
December 31, 2009. The loan may be extended in whole or in part, at our option, for two one-year periods, subject to certain conditions. We anticipate that the property will have sufficient funds to cover debt service and all operating
requirements in 2010. However, based on the December 31, 2009 debt service coverage ratio, the loan agreement requires that we deposit excess cash flow generated by the hotel into a lender restricted escrow.

Interest Rate Derivative Instruments

We have entered into several derivatives to manage our exposures to risks associated with changes in interest rates. None of our derivatives have been entered into for trading purposes. See Note 12 –
Fair Value Measurements.

Aggregate Debt Maturities

Aggregate debt maturities at December 31, 2009 are as follows (in millions):

(1)

During the first quarter of 2010, we redeemed $346 million face amount of our Series M senior notes and repaid the $124 million mortgage debt on Atlanta
Marriott Marquis.

(2)

The debt maturing in 2011 includes the $300 million mortgage loan on the Orlando World Center Marriott, which can be extended, in whole or in part for two one-year
periods at our option, subject to achieving a certain debt coverage ratio and other conditions.

Interest

The following are included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, (in millions):

(1)

Interest expense and interest paid for 2009 is net of $7 million received in connection with the 2007 defeasance of $514 million in collateralized mortgage-backed
securities.

(2)

Interest expense and interest paid for 2007 include prepayment premiums of $40 million in 2007. No significant prepayment premiums were paid in 2009 or 2008.

(3)

Primarily represents the amortization of the debt discount, which is non-cash interest expense, on our Debentures established at the date of issuance. See
“—Exchangeable Debentures.”

(4)

Does not include capitalized interest of $5 million, $10 million, and $10 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Amortization of property and equipment under capital leases totaled $1 million for 2009 and $2 million for both 2008 and 2007 and
is included in depreciation and amortization on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Stockholders’ Equity

We have authorized 1,050 million shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share, of which 646.3 million and 525.3 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Fifty million shares
of no par value preferred stock are authorized, with 4.0 million shares outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Issuances

On April 29, 2009, we issued 75,750,000 shares of common stock at $6.60 per share and received
net proceeds of approximately $480 million, after underwriting discounts and commissions and transaction expenses.

On
August 19, 2009, we entered into a Sales Agency Financing Agreement with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, through which we may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to
$400 million. During 2009, we issued approximately 28 million shares of common stock through this program at an average price of approximately $10.27 per share for net proceeds of approximately $287 million. We may continue to sell
shares of common stock under this program from time to time based on market conditions, although we are not under obligation to sell any shares.

On December 22, 2009, Host LP issued the 2009 Debentures for proceeds of $391 million, net of underwriting fees and expenses. We separately account for the debt and equity portion of the
debentures to reflect the fair value of the liability component based on our non-convertible borrowing cost at the issuance date. The excess proceeds received over the fair value of the liability are allocated to the equity component of the
debentures. Accordingly, we allocated $82 million to the equity portion of the 2009 Debentures upon their issuance. See Note 4, “Debt.”

Dividends

On September 14, 2009, Host announced that its Board of
Directors authorized a special dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock of Host, which was paid on December 18, 2009 to holders of record as of November 6, 2009. The dividend was paid with cash or with shares of common stock, at the
election of the stockholder. In order to comply with Host’s remaining REIT taxable income distribution requirements for the year ended December 31, 2008, while retaining capital and maintaining maximum financial flexibility, Host’s
Board of Directors determined that the cash component of the dividend (other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) would not exceed 10% in the aggregate. As a result, we issued 13.4 million shares of Host common stock valued at
$140 million on December 18, 2009, and paid cash in the amount of $16 million, for a total dividend of $156 million.

Stock Repurchase

During 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of common
stock and equity-related securities. These securities may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions, depending on market conditions. During 2008, the Company repurchased 6.5 million shares valued at approximately
$100 million. The shares repurchased constitute authorized but unissued shares.



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Additionally, as part of this program, we repurchased $175 million face amount of the Debentures in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, for approximately
$151 million. See Note 4, “Debt.” This program was terminated in the third quarter of 2009 and no additional common shares or equity related securities have been repurchased as part of this program. At the time of termination, there
was $249 million left under the Board’s authorization for future repurchases.

Preferred Stock

We currently have one class of publicly-traded preferred stock outstanding: 4,034,300 shares of 8

% per annum of the $25.00 per share liquidation
preference, which are payable quarterly in arrears. After June 2, 2009, we have the option to redeem the Class E preferred stock for $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of redemption. The preferred stock ranks senior
to the common stock. The preferred stockholders generally have no voting rights. Accrued preferred dividends at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $2 million.

6.

Income Taxes

We elected
to be taxed as a REIT effective January 1, 1999, pursuant to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In general, a corporation that elects REIT status and meets certain tax law requirements regarding the distribution of its taxable
income to its stockholders as prescribed by applicable tax laws and complies with certain other requirements (relating primarily to the nature of its assets and the sources of its revenues) is generally not subject to federal and state income
taxation on its operating income distributed to its stockholders. In addition to paying federal and state income taxes on any retained income, we are subject to taxes on “built-in-gains” resulting from sales of certain assets.
Additionally, our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and foreign income tax. The consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of the taxable REIT
subsidiaries, state income taxes incurred by Host and Host LP and foreign income taxes incurred by Host LP, as well as each of their respective subsidiaries.

Where required, deferred income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial
reporting bases of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryovers based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. However, deferred
tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable
income and tax planning strategies.

Total deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as
follows (in millions):



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We have recorded a 100% valuation allowance of approximately $36 million against
the net deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss and asset tax credit carryovers as of December 31, 2009 with respect to our hotel in Mexico. There is a $1 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to
the net operating loss and capital loss carryovers as of December 31, 2009 with respect to our hotels in Canada. The net increase in the valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was approximately
$9 million and $3 million, respectively. We expect that all net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carryovers for U.S. federal income tax purposes to be realized. The primary components of our net deferred tax asset were as
follows (in millions):

At December 31, 2009, we have aggregate gross domestic and foreign net operating loss, capital loss and
tax credit carryovers of approximately $169 million. We have deferred tax assets related to these loss and tax credit carryovers of approximately $62 million, with a valuation allowance of approximately $37 million. Our net operating
loss carryovers expire through 2027, and our foreign capital loss carryovers have no expiration period. Our domestic alternative minimum tax credits have no expiration period and our foreign asset tax credits expire through 2017.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The total (benefit) provision for income taxes, including the amounts associated with
discontinued operations, was ($39) million, ($3) million and $3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The differences between the income tax (benefit) provision calculated at the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% and the actual income tax (benefit) provision recorded each year for continuing operations are as follows (in
millions):

Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, was $5 million in 2009 and $7 million in each
of 2008 and 2007.

Current accounting literature prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return. We must determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related
appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater
than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. This accounting standard applies to all tax positions related to income taxes. A reconciliation of the beginning and
ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

All of such amount, if recognized, would impact our
reconciliation between the income tax provision (benefit) calculated at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% and the actual income tax provision (benefit) recorded each year. In 2009, we recognized an income tax benefit of $7 million
relating to the reduction of previously accrued income taxes after an evaluation of the exposure items and the expiration of the related statutes of limitation. No such amount was recognized in 2007 or 2008.

It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within 12 months of the reporting date due to the
expiration of certain statutes of limitation. An estimate of the range of such possible decrease is zero to $.5 million. As of December 31, 2009, the tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions generally include
2006-2009.

We recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating
expenses. During each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized approximately $0.1 million of interest expense related to the unrecognized tax benefits. We had approximately $0.5 million and $0.4 million
of interest accrued at December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Leases

Hotel Leases

We lease substantially all of our hotels (the “Leases”) to a wholly owned subsidiary that qualifies as a taxable
REIT subsidiary due to federal income tax restrictions on a REIT’s ability to derive revenue directly from the operation and management of a hotel.

Hospitality Properties Trust Relationship.

In a series of related transactions in 1995 and 1996, we sold and leased back 53 Courtyard by Marriott
(“Courtyard”) properties and 18 Residence Inn by Marriott (“Residence Inn”) properties to Hospitality Properties Trust (“HPT”). These leases, which are accounted for as operating leases and are included in the table
below, have initial terms expiring between 2010 and 2012 and are renewable at our option. Minimum rent payments are $59 million annually for the Courtyard properties and $21 million annually for the Residence Inn properties, and additional
rent based upon sales levels are payable to HPT under the terms of the leases.

In 1998, we sublet the HPT properties (the
“Subleases”) to separate sublessee subsidiaries of Barceló Crestline Corporation (the “Sublessee”), subject to the terms of the applicable HPT lease. The term of each Sublease expires simultaneously with the expiration of
the initial term of the HPT lease to which it relates and automatically renews for the corresponding renewal term under the HPT lease, unless either we or the Sublessee elect not to renew the Sublease provided, however, that neither party can elect
to terminate fewer than all of the Subleases in a particular pool of HPT properties (one for the Courtyard properties and one for the Residence Inn properties). Rent payable by the Sublessee under the Subleases consists of the minimum rent payable
under the HPT lease and an additional percentage rent payable to us. The percentage rent payable by the Sublessee is generally sufficient to cover the additional rent due under the HPT lease, with any excess being retained by us. Rent payable under
the subleases is guaranteed by the parent of the subtenants up to a maximum of approximately $21.6 million for the Courtyard leases, of which approximately $6.7 million has been funded through December 31, 2009, and approximately
$10.8 million for the Residence Inn leases, of which approximately $5.9 million has been funded through December 31, 2009. To the extent the parent of the subtenants fails to perform or fully funds its guarantee obligation, we will be
responsible for funding any rent shortfalls to HPT. At the expiration of these leases, HPT will return our initial security deposit of approximately $67 million, plus additional cash collateral of approximately $7.8 million. We gave notice
that we will terminate the lease on the 18 Residence Inn properties effective December 31, 2010, at which time we expect our $17 million security deposit will be returned by HPT. In 2010, we also intend to give notice that we will
terminate the lease on the 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties effective December 31, 2012.

Other Lease Information

As of December 31, 2009, all or a portion of 35 of our hotels are subject to ground leases, generally with multiple
renewal options, all of which are accounted for as operating leases. For lease agreements with scheduled rent increases, we recognize the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of these leases contain provisions
for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts. Additionally, the rental payments under one lease are based on real estate tax assessments. We also have leases on facilities used in our former
restaurant business, some of which we subsequently subleased. These leases and subleases contain one or more renewal options, generally for five or ten-year periods. The restaurant leases are accounted for as operating leases. Our lease activities
also include leases entered into by our hotels for various types of equipment, such as computer equipment, vehicles and telephone systems. Equipment leases are accounted for as either operating or capital leases depending on the characteristics of
the

particular lease arrangement. Equipment leases that are characterized as capital leases are classified as furniture and equipment and are depreciated over the life of the lease. The amortization
charge applicable to capitalized leases is included in depreciation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

The following table presents the future minimum annual rental commitments required under non-cancelable leases for which we are the lessee as of December 31, 2009. Minimum payments for the operating leases have not been reduced by
aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the Sublessee of approximately $7 million and $198 million, respectively, payable to us under non-cancelable subleases.

We remain contingently liable on certain leases relating to our former restaurant business. Such
contingent liabilities aggregated $20 million as of December 31, 2009. However, management considers the likelihood of any material funding related to these leases to be remote.

Employee Stock Plans

We
maintain two stock-based compensation plans, the Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2009 Comprehensive Plan”), whereby we may award to participating employees (i) restricted shares of our common stock, (ii) options
to purchase our common stock and (iii) deferred shares of our common stock and the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). At December 31, 2009, there were approximately 19.2 million shares of common stock reserved and available for
issuance under the 2009 Comprehensive Plan.

We recognize costs resulting from our share-based payment transactions in our
financial statements over their vesting periods. We classify share-based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity awards or liability awards. The classification of our restricted stock awards as either an equity



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options. Equity awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. Liability classified awards are re-measured to fair
value each reporting period. The value of all restricted stock awards, less estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award—the requisite service period
(usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service. All restricted stock awards to senior executives outstanding as of December 31, 2009 have been classified as
liability awards, primarily due to settlement features that allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax requirements in excess of the statutory minimum withholding. Restricted stock awards to our
other employees, including upper-middle management, have been classified as equity awards as these awards do not have this optional tax withholding feature.

On May 14, 2009, our stockholders approved the 2009 Comprehensive Plan, which authorized 25 million shares that can be issued for stock-based compensation to employees and directors. Shares
described below that were granted after this date were issued under this plan. We granted 4.8 million restricted shares to senior executives that vest in 2010 and 2011 and 1.0 million stock options under this plan. We also granted
0.2 million restricted shares to other employees at a per share price of $10.40.

Prior to the adoption of the 2009
Comprehensive Plan, we granted 2.4 million restricted shares and 0.4 million stock options to senior executives that had a requisite service period through December 31, 2009. These shares were granted under our previous 1997
Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan (the “1997 Comprehensive Plan”, which is not in effect as of December 31, 2009. We also granted 0.2 million restricted shares to upper-middle management during 2009 through the 1997
Comprehensive Plan.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded compensation expense of approximately $20.5 million,
$2.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively. Shares granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled 9.0 million, 0.3 million and 0.1 million, respectively, while 2.2 million, 0.3 million and 0.3 million vested during
those years. Approximately 6.5 million shares are unvested as of December 31, 2009 with a weighted average fair value of $6.86.

Senior Executive Restricted Stock

During the 2009, we granted shares to
senior executives that vested through year end 2011 in three annual installments (the “2009 – 2011 Plan”). Vesting for these shares is determined based on (1) personal performance based on the achievement of specific management
business objectives or (2) market performance based on the achievement of total shareholder return on a relative basis. These awards are considered liability awards; therefore we recognize compensation expense over the requisite period based on
the fair value of the award at the balance sheet date. The fair value of the personal performance awards are based on management’s estimate of shares that will vest during the requisite service period at the balance sheet market rate. The fair
value of the awards that vest based on market performance is estimated using a simulation or Monte Carlo method. For the purpose of the simulation at year end 2009, we assumed a volatility of 82.0%, which is calculated based on the volatility of our
stock price over the last three years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.70%, which reflects the yield on a 3-year Treasury bond, and stock betas of 1.075 and 1.38 compared to the Lodging composite index and the REIT composite index, respectively,
based on three years of historical price data. The number of shares issued is adjusted for forfeitures.

The majority of
shares that vested in 2009 were granted on February 5, 2009 under the 1997 Comprehensive Plan. Approximately 1.2 million shares were granted that vest based on the satisfaction of personal performance goals set by each individual
executive, of which approximately 0.9 million shares vested during 2009. Approximately 0.6 million shares were granted that vest based on the achievement of total shareholder return on



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

a relative basis compared to the NAREIT index, of which approximately 87.5%, or, 0.6 million shares, vested during 2009. Approximately 0.6 million shares were granted that vest based on
the achievement of total shareholder return in comparison to eight other lodging companies, of which none vested during 2009. The 0.6 million shares that did not vest based on the achievement of market conditions are still outstanding and may
be earned based on our cumulative relative market performance for the period from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011.

The majority of shares that vest in 2010 and 2011 were granted on August 25, 2009 under the 2009 Comprehensive Plan. Approximately 2.3 million shares were granted that vest based on the satisfaction of personal performance goals
set by each individual executive. Approximately 1.2 million shares were granted that vest based on the achievement of total shareholder return on a relative basis compared to the NAREIT index. Approximately 1.2 million shares were granted
that vest based on the achievement of total shareholder return in comparison to eight other lodging companies.

During the
first quarter of 2006, we granted shares to senior executives that vested through year end 2008 in three annual installments (the “2006—2008 Plan”). The plan concluded as of December 31, 2008 and all shares were either vested or
forfeited. Vesting for these shares was determined both on continued employment and market performance based on the achievement of total shareholder return on an absolute and relative basis. Approximately 110,000 shares that vested as of
December 31, 2008 were issued on February 5, 2009. There are no shares outstanding under this plan as of December 31, 2009.

We made an additional grant of shares to senior executives in February 2006 (“2006 supplemental grant”). Twenty-five percent of this award vested immediately and was expensed on the date of
grant, while the remaining 75% vested over a three-year period that began in February 2006 based on continued employment. Approximately 94,000 shares that vested as of February 2009 were issued on February 9, 2009. We recognized compensation
expense from January 1, 2009 through February 9, 2009 based on the market price at February 9, 2009. There are no shares outstanding under this plan as of December 31, 2009.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded compensation expense of approximately $19 million, $2 million and $3 million
respectively, related to the restricted stock awards to senior executives. Based on the valuation criteria above, the total unrecognized compensation cost that relates to nonvested restricted stock awards at December 31, 2009 was approximately
$40 million, which, if earned, will be recognized over the weighted average of one year. The following table is a summary of the status of our senior executive plans for the three years ended December 31, 2009. The fair values for the
awards below are based on the fair value at the respective transaction dates, as the awards are classified as liability awards.

(1)

Shares that vest at December 31 of each year are issued to the employees in the first quarter of the following year, although the requisite service period is
complete. Accordingly, the 0.1 million shares issued in 2009 include shares vested at December 31, 2008, after adjusting for shares withheld to meet employee tax requirements. The shares withheld for employee tax requirements were valued
at $0.6 million, $1.6 million and $13.3 million, for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Upper Middle Management and Broad-Based Restricted Stock Issuances

We maintain a restricted stock program for our upper-middle management. Vesting for these shares is determined based on continued employment
and, accordingly, we recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of three years. Additionally, in August 2009, we issued restricted shares to eligible employees in a broad-based issuance. These shares vest over a
two-year period.

We recorded compensation expense related to these shares of $1.4 million, $1.1 million and
$1.6 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost, measured on the grant date, that relates to nonvested restricted stock awards at December 31, 2009 was approximately $1.4 million, which,
if earned, will be recognized over the weighted average remaining service period of one year. The following table is a summary of the status of our upper-middle management plan for the three years ended December 31, 2009. The fair values
for the awards below are based on the fair value at the grant date of the respective awards, which is equal to the market value on such date, as the awards are classified as equity awards.

(1)

Shares that vest at December 31 of each year are issued to the employees in the first quarter of the following year, although the requisite service period is
complete. Accordingly, the 77,000 shares issued in 2009 include the shares vested at December 31, 2008, after adjusting for shares withheld to meet employee tax requirements. The shares withheld for employee tax requirements were valued at
$0.1 million for 2009 and were immaterial for 2008 and 2007.

Employee Stock Options

As part of the 2009 Comprehensive Plan, we granted 1.4 million stock options during the year. The options expire ten years after the
grant date. Vesting for these shares is based on continuing employment. The fair value of the stock options was estimated on the date of grant based on a Simulation/Monte Carlo method. During 2009, 464,000 of the options were issued under the 1997
Comprehensive Plan that vested on December 31, 2009. These options were valued assuming a volatility of 49.7%, an average dividend of 5%, and an average risk free interest rate of 2.06%. The remaining 931,000 options, which vest in two equal
installments in 2010 and 2011, were granted under the 2009 Comprehensive Plan. These options were valued assuming a volatility of 57%, an average dividend of 5% and an average risk free interest rate of 2.24%.

On December 31, 2009, approximately 464,000 of the options vested and we recorded approximately $0.8 million in compensation expense
for these options in 2009. No other options were granted between December 2002 and December 2008. The following table summarizes the stock option grants during the year.

The following table is a summary of the status of our stock option plans that have been
approved by our stockholders. We do not have stock option plans that have not been approved by our stockholders.

The following table summarized the information about stock options at December 31, 2009.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under the terms of the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”), eligible employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at 90% of the lower of market value at the beginning or end of the plan period and is therefore compensatory under SFAS 123R. Effective January 1, 2008, we updated the plan so that shares vested on a calendar quarter basis and
employees made their purchase options on a quarterly basis. Prior to 2008, the shares vested on an annual basis. We record compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan based on the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights,
which is estimated using an option-priced model. The compensation expense reflected in net income was not material for all periods presented.

9.

Profit Sharing and Postemployment Benefit Plans

We contribute to defined contribution plans for the benefit of employees meeting certain eligibility requirements and electing participation in the plans. The discretionary amount to be matched by us is
determined annually by the Board of Directors. We provide medical benefits to a limited number of retired employees meeting restrictive eligibility requirements. Our recorded liability for this obligation is not material. Payments for these items
were not material for the three years ended December 31, 2009.

10.

Discontinued Operations

We disposed of one hotel in the first quarter of 2010 (which is classified as held-for-sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009), six hotels in 2009, two hotels in 2008 and nine hotels in 2007. The 2009
dispositions include one hotel for which our ground lease expired in 2009 and, in connection therewith, the hotel

Gain on Insurance Settlement

Eight of our properties sustained damage from hurricanes during 2005. Two of these properties, the New Orleans Marriott and the Fort Lauderdale Marina Marriott, had extensive damage that required us to temporarily close all or part thereof.
Property damage was $37 million. Our insurance coverage for the properties entitles us to receive recoveries for damage as well as payments for business interruption. During 2007, we received property insurance proceeds of $38 million and
recorded a gain on property insurance proceeds of $22 million. Gains on property insurance proceeds represent proceeds received in excess of the insurance receivable, which receivable represents the book value of the damaged assets that were
written-off. All gains resulting from insurance proceeds are recognized at the point in time that all contingencies are resolved. We did not receive any property insurance proceeds in 2009 or 2008.

During 2008 and 2007, we also recorded a gain on business interruption insurance proceeds of $7 million and $36 million, respectively,
related to hurricanes in those years. We did not receive any business interruption insurance proceeds in 2009.

12.

Fair Value Measurements

We have adopted the provisions under GAAP for both recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements. Our recurring fair value measurements consist of the valuation of our derivative instruments, which may or may not be designated as
accounting hedges. Non-recurring fair value measurements during 2009 consisted of the impairment of four of our hotel properties and an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in the European joint venture.

In evaluating the fair value of both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, GAAP outlines a valuation framework and creates a
fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and a reporting entity’s own assumptions about market data (unobservable inputs). The requirements are intended to increase the
consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date in an orderly transaction (an
exit price). Assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy, as defined by GAAP. The three levels are as follows:

Level 1—Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market is defined as a market
in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing on an ongoing basis.

Level 2—Inputs
include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active (markets with few transactions), inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means.



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Level 3—Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the pricing of an asset
or liability when observable inputs are not available.

The following table details the fair value of our financial assets and
liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as when non-recurring fair value measurements that we completed during 2009 due to the impairment of non-financial assets.

(1)

These derivative contracts have been designated as hedging instruments under GAAP.

(2)

As described below, our forward currency purchase contracts were entered into in 2008. At December 31, 2008, these contracts had a value of $6.1 million based
on Level 2 inputs as described in the fair value hierarchy.

(3)

The fair value measurements are as of the measurement date of the impairment and may not reflect the book value as of December 31, 2009.

Interest rate swap derivatives.

During 2009, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements for
a notional amount totaling $300 million related to The Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa mortgage loan in the amount of $300 million. We entered into the derivative instruments to hedge changes in the
fair value of the fixed-rate mortgage that occur as a result of changes in the 3-month LIBOR rate. As a result, we will pay a floating interest rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR plus a spread which ranges from 2.7% to 3.2%, as opposed to the fixed
rate of 5.531%, on the notional amount of $300 million through March 1, 2014. We have designated these derivatives as fair value hedges. The derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement. We
also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps. As of December 31, 2009, we recorded a liability of $1 million related to the fair value of the swaps. At the same time, we record the change in the
fair value of the underlying debt due to change in the 3-month LIBOR rate as a reduction to the carrying amount of the debt, or $.7 million, at December 31, 2009. The difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the
change in the fair value in the underlying debt is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship. We recognized a loss of $.3 million related to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship in 2009.

Interest Rate Cap Derivative.

In connection with the mortgage debt secured by the JW Marriott,
Washington, D.C., we entered into an interest rate cap agreement which caps the LIBOR rate at 3% through the life of the loan. At December 31, 2009, the variable interest rate on the loan was 7.5% and the fair value of the cap was
$1.8 million. The interest rate cap is valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

measurement. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the cap. We recognized a gain of $.3 million based on the changes in the fair value of the
derivative during the year. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in gain on foreign currency and derivatives on the consolidated statements of operations.

Foreign Currency Forward Purchase Contracts.

During 2008, we entered into three foreign currency
forward purchase contracts totaling €60 million (approximately $88 million) to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the European joint venture. Under these
transactions, we will sell the Euro amount, and receive the U.S. Dollar amount on the forward purchase date. These derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation and are
marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the equity portion of our balance sheet. The forward purchase contracts are valued based on the forward yield curve of the Euro to U.S. Dollar
forward exchange rate on the date of measurement. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps. The following table summarizes our three foreign currency purchase contracts (in millions):

Impairment of Hotel
Properties.

During 2009, we reviewed our hotel portfolio for impairment and identified several properties that may be sold prior to the end of their previously estimated useful lives or that had current or projected
operating losses or other events or circumstances indicating a reduction in value or change in intended use. Properties exhibiting these characteristics were tested for impairment based on management’s estimate of expected future undiscounted
cash flows from operations and sale during our expected remaining hold period. The fair value of these properties was determined based on either a discounted cash flow analysis or negotiated sales price. Based on these assessments, we recorded
non-cash impairment charges totaling $97 million for 2009 of which $66 million is included in depreciation and amortization and the remaining $31 million in discontinued operations.

Other-than-temporary impairment of investment.

During 2009, we determined that our investment in the
European joint venture was impaired based on the reduction of distributable cash flows from the joint venture, which has been caused primarily by a decline in cash flows generated by the properties. We believe this impairment to be
other-than-temporary as defined by GAAP because the time period over which the joint venture may be able to improve operations such that our investment would be fully recoverable is constrained by the remaining life of the joint venture. As a
result, during the second quarter we recorded a non-cash impairment charge totaling $34 million in equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates based on the difference between our investment’s estimated fair value and its carrying value. As
of December 31, 2009, we determined that our investment was not impaired.

Fair Value of Other Financial Assets and
Liabilities.

Although permitted under GAAP, we did not elect the fair measurement option for any of our other financial assets or liabilities. Notes receivable and other financial assets are valued based on the
expected future cash flows discounted at risk-adjusted rates. Valuations for secured debt and our credit facility are determined based on the expected future payments discounted at risk-

adjusted rates. Senior notes and the Exchangeable Senior Debentures are valued based on quoted market prices. The fair values of financial instruments not included in this table are estimated to
be equal to their carrying amounts. The fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities and other financial instruments are shown below:

Notes receivable and

Relationship with Marriott International

We have entered into various agreements with Marriott, including the management of approximately 60% of our hotels, financing for joint ventures or partnerships, including our JW Marriott Hotel, Mexico
City, Mexico and certain limited administrative services.

In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we paid Marriott $105 million,
$178 million and $197 million, respectively, in hotel management fees and approximately $1 million, in franchise fees for each of 2009, 2008 and 2007. Included in the management fees are amounts paid to The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company,
LLC (Ritz-Carlton), Courtyard Management Corporation and Residence Inn Management Corporation.

We enter into negotiations
with Marriott from time to time in order to secure mutually beneficial modifications to the terms of management agreements on an individual or portfolio-wide basis, most typically in connection with repositioning projects or substantial capital
investments at our properties. We negotiated amendments to various management agreements with Marriott in 2005 and agreed, among other matters, to waive performance termination tests through the end of fiscal year 2009, to modify certain extension
tests which condition the manager’s ability to renew the management agreements, and to extend certain contracts for ten additional years. As part of this negotiation, Marriott agreed to make cash payments to us, over time, to reduce an existing
cap on the costs and expenses related to chain services that are provided on a centralized basis, as well as to establish a cap on certain other costs, to provide us with an incentive to increase our capital expenditures at the hotels through 2008,
to waive certain deferred management fees, and to modify the incentive management fee on certain contracts. We agreed to use a portion of Marriott’s cash payments for brand reinvestment projects at various hotels in our portfolio.

14.

Hotel Management Agreements and Operating and License Agreements

Our hotels are subject to management agreements under which various operators, including Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt, Swissôtel, Hilton, Four Seasons, Fairmont and Starwood, operate our hotels in
exchange for the payment of a management fee. The agreements generally provide for both base and incentive management fees



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

that are based on hotel sales and operating profit, respectively. As part of the management agreements, the manager furnishes the hotels with certain chain services which are generally provided
on a central or regional basis to all hotels in the manager’s hotel system. Chain services include central training, advertising and promotion, national reservation systems, computerized payroll and accounting services, and such additional
services as needed which may be more efficiently performed on a centralized basis. Costs and expenses incurred in providing such services are allocated among the hotels managed, owned or leased by the manager on a fair and equitable basis. In
addition, our managers will generally have a guest rewards program which will be charged to all of the hotels that participate in the program.

We are obligated to provide the manager with sufficient funds, generally 5% of revenue generated at the hotel, to cover the cost of (a) certain non-routine repairs and maintenance to the hotels which
are normally capitalized; and (b) replacements and renewals to the hotels’ furniture, fixtures and equipment. Under certain circumstances, we will be required to establish escrow accounts for such purposes under terms outlined in the
agreements.

Marriott International

As of December 31, 2009, 65 of our hotels were subject to management agreements under which Marriott or one of their subsidiaries manages the hotels, generally for an initial term of 15 to 20 years
with one or more renewal terms at the option of Marriott. Marriott typically receives a base fee of three percent of gross revenues and incentive management fees generally equal to 20% of operating profit after we have received a priority return. We
have the option to terminate certain management agreements if specified performance or extension thresholds are not satisfied. A single agreement may be canceled under certain conditions, although such cancellation will not trigger the cancellation
of any other agreement.

Additionally, while most of our management agreements are not terminable prior to their full term, we
have negotiated rights with respect to 18 specified Marriott-branded hotels to terminate management agreements in connection with the sale of these hotels, subject to certain limitations, including the number of agreements that can be terminated per
year, limitations measured by EBITDA, and limitations requiring that a significant part of such hotels maintain the Marriott brand affiliation. The described termination rights may be exercised without payment of a termination fee, except for one of
the specified hotels wherein a termination fee is required if it does not maintain the Marriott brand affiliation.

We have a
franchise agreement with Marriott for one hotel. Pursuant to the franchise agreement, we pay a franchise fee based on a percentage of room sales and food and beverage sales, as well as certain other fees for advertising and reservations. Franchise
fees for room sales are approximately six percent of sales, while fees for food and beverage sales are approximately three percent of sales. The franchise agreement has a term of 30 years.

Ritz-Carlton

As of December 31, 2009, we hold management agreements with Ritz-Carlton, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marriott, to manage nine of our hotels. These agreements have an initial term of 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at
the option of Ritz-Carlton. Base management fees vary from two to five percent of sales and incentive management fees, if any, are generally equal to 20% of available cash flow or operating profit, after we have received a priority return as defined
in the agreements.

Starwood

As of December 31, 2009, 21 of our hotels are subject to operating and license agreements with Starwood, under which Starwood operates the hotels, for an initial term of 20 years, with two renewal
terms of 10 years



HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

each. Starwood receives compensation in the form of a base fee of 1% of annual gross operating revenues, and an incentive fee of 20% of annual gross operating profit, after we have received a
priority return of 10.75% on our purchase price and other investments in the hotels.

The license agreements address matters
relating to the subject brand, including rights to use service marks, logos, symbols and trademarks, such as those associated with Westin, Sheraton, W, Luxury Collection and St. Regis, as well as matters relating to compliance with certain standards
and policies and (including through other agreements in the case of certain hotels) the provision of certain system program and centralized services. The license agreements have an initial term of 20 years each, with two renewal terms of 10 years
each at the option of the licensor. Licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees of 5% of room sales and 2% of food and beverage sales.

We have termination rights relating to the operating agreements on 11 specified hotels upon the sale of those hotels. Such termination rights are currently active with respect to two of such hotels. With
respect to one of those hotels, we have the limited right to also terminate one license agreement annually and, in February 2010, we disposed of this hotel. With respect to nine of the 11 specified hotels, we have the right beginning in 2016 to sell
35% of such hotels (measured by EBITDA), not to exceed two hotels annually, free and clear of the existing operating agreement over a period of time without the payment of a termination fee. With respect to any termination of an operating agreement
on sale, the proposed purchaser would need to meet the requirements for transfer under the applicable license agreement.

Other Managers

As of December 31, 2009, we also hold management agreements with hotel management
companies such as Hyatt, Hilton, Four Seasons and Fairmont for 15 of our hotels. These agreements generally provide for an initial term of 10 to 20 years, with renewal terms at the option of either party or, in some cases, the hotel management
company of up to an additional one to 15 years. The agreements generally provide for payment of base management fees equal to one to four percent of sales. These agreements also provide for incentive management fees generally equal to 10 to 30
percent of available cash flow, operating profit, or net operating income, as defined in the agreements, after we have received a priority return.

Geographic and Business Segment Information

We consider each one of our hotels to be an operating segment, none of which meets the threshold for a reportable segment. We also allocate resources and assess operating performance based on individual
hotels. All of our other real estate investment activities (primarily our leased hotels and office buildings) are immaterial and meet the aggregation criteria, and thus, we report one segment: hotel ownership. Our foreign operations consist of four
properties located in Canada, two properties located in Chile and one property located in Mexico. There were no intersegment sales during the periods presented. The following table presents revenues and long-lived assets for each of the geographical
areas in which we operate (in millions):

Guarantees and Contingencies

We have certain guarantees which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to various dispositions, spin-offs and contractual arrangements,
but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party. We consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote. The guarantees are listed below:

•

We remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non-lodging properties. These primarily represent certain divested restaurants
that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments. The aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately $20 million as of December 31, 2009.

•

In 1997, we owned Leisure Park Venture Limited Partnership, which owns and operates a senior living facility. We spun-off the partnership to
Barceló Crestline Corporation, formerly Crestline Capital Corporation, in the REIT conversion, but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to $14.7 million of municipal bonds issued by the New Jersey
Economic Development Authority through their maturity in 2027. However, to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee, we have been indemnified by Barceló Crestline Corporation, who, in turn, is indemnified by the
current owner of the facility.

•

In connection with the sale of two hotels in January 2005, we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases. The
future minimum lease payments are approximately $13 million through the full term of the leases, including renewal options. We believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote, and in each case, we have been indemnified by
the purchaser of the hotel.

•

In connection with the Starwood acquisition, we have three properties with environmental liabilities, primarily asbestos in non-public areas of the
properties, for which we have recorded the present value of the liability, or approximately $2.7 million, in accordance with FIN 47 “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”. The amount is based on management’s
estimate of the timing and future costs to remediate the liability. We will record the accretion expense over the period we intend to hold the hotel or until the item is remediated.

Legal Proceedings

On
February 8, 2010, we received an adverse jury verdict in a trial in the 166th Judicial District Court of Bexar County, Texas involving the sale of land encumbered by a ground lease for the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter hotel. The jury found
that we intentionally interfered with the attempted sale by Keystone-Texas Property Holding Corporation of the land under the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter and slandered title to the property. The jury awarded damages that range from $42 million
to $56 million, including statutory interest, as well as exemplary damages on the latter claim. The verdict is not yet final and is subject to post-trial motions. Based on the range of possible outcomes, we accrued an additional potential litigation
loss of approximately $41 million in the fourth quarter consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, which is included in corporate expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. We believe that a number of legal rulings
decided by the trial court were in error and had an adverse effect on the jury’s verdict. We intend to vigorously pursue these issues in post trial motions and, if necessary, on appeal.

reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and (2) is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including Host’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. With the participation of Host’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 based on the Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our
independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Item 8 of this report.
