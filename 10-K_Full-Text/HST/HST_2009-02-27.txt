The Lodging Industry

The lodging industry in the
United States consists of private and public entities that operate in an extremely diversified market under a variety of brand names. The lodging industry has several key participants:

•

Owners—own the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel. These properties may be branded and operated
under the manager’s brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager. The properties may also be operated as an independent hotel (unaffiliated with any brand) by an independent
hotel manager. Host operates as an owner of lodging properties.

•

Owner/Managers—own the hotel and operate the property with their own management team. These properties may be branded under a franchise agreement, operated as
an independent hotel (unaffiliated


with any brand) or operated under the owner’s brand. REITs are restricted from operating and managing hotels under applicable REIT laws.

•

Franchisors—own a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system. Franchisors provide their
branded hotels with brand recognition, marketing support and centralized reservation systems.

•

Franchisor/Manager—own a brand or brands and also operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee.

•

Manager—operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner, but do not, themselves, own a brand. The hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement or as an
independent hotel (unaffiliated with any brand).

The hotel manager is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the
hotels, including the employment of hotel staff, the determination of room rates, the development of sales and marketing plans, the preparation of operating and capital expenditure budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner. They
typically receive fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel.

Our industry is influenced by the cyclical relationship
between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms. Lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy in addition to local market factors that stimulate travel to specific destinations. In particular, economic
indicators such as GDP growth, business investment and employment growth are some of the primary drivers of lodging demand. Between 2003 and 2007, broad growth in the economy led to increases in demand. By contrast, slower economic growth and lower
levels of capital investment typically slow the rate of demand growth for the lodging industry. During 2008, the overall weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly the turmoil in the credit markets, weakness in the housing market, and volatile
energy and commodity costs, resulted in considerable negative pressure on both consumer and business spending. As a result, lodging demand, which had begun to show signs of weakness in the first half of 2008, declined significantly during the
second half of the year. We believe that lodging demand will continue to contract until the key economic indicators discussed above reverse course and display consistent growth.

Lodging supply growth is generally driven by overall lodging demand, as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development.
However, the rate of supply growth is also influenced by a number of additional factors including availability of capital, interest rates, construction costs and unique market considerations. Additionally, the relatively long lead-time required to
complete the development of hotels, while making supply growth relatively easier to forecast than demand growth, increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry. As a result, at different points in the cycle, demand and
supply may increase or decrease in a dissimilar manner such that demand may increase when there is no new supply or supply may grow when demand is declining. As lodging demand strengthened between 2003 and 2007, there was an increase in the pace of
new hotel construction starts from its cyclical lows; however, the pace of construction remained well below long-term averages. Based on data compiled by Smith Travel Research, supply in 2009 will likely be at or slightly above the long-term average
rate; however, beginning in 2010, supply growth is expected to decline significantly.


Revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) is an operational measure commonly used in the hotel
industry to evaluate hotel performance. RevPAR represents the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved but excludes other revenue generated by a hotel property, such as food and beverage, parking,
telephone and other guest service revenues. The charts below detail the supply, demand and RevPAR growth for the U.S. lodging industry and for the luxury and upper-upscale segment for 2004 to 2008 based on data provided by Smith Travel Research.

U.S. Lodging Industry Supply, Demand and RevPAR Growth

Luxury and upper-upscale Supply, Demand and RevPAR Growth


Business Strategy

Our primary long-term business objective is to provide superior total returns to our stockholders through a combination of appreciation in asset values and growth in earnings and dividends. To achieve this objective
we seek to:

•

maximize the value of our existing portfolio through aggressive asset management, as described further below;

•

acquire luxury and upper-upscale hotels operated by leading management companies that are generally located in urban and resort/conference destinations;

•

maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile that has an appropriate balance of debt and equity and that provides us with sufficient liquidity and flexibility
to take advantage of opportunities throughout the business cycle;

•

diversify our portfolio holdings and revenue sources by creating investment funds and joint ventures; and

•

dispose of non-core assets, including smaller or older hotels that are at a competitive risk or that are located in suburban or slower-growth markets.

Asset Management.

As the largest REIT owner of luxury and upper-upscale properties in the
U.S., we are in a unique position to work with the managers of our hotels to maximize revenues while minimizing operating costs. The size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading operators and brands in the
industry allow us to benchmark similar hotels and identify best practices, evaluate return on investment and repositioning opportunities and efficiencies that can be communicated to our managers. We continue to evaluate key performance indicators to
ensure an appropriate level of assistance is provided to our managers to maximize opportunities at each asset. Areas of focus include enhancing revenue management for rooms, food and beverage and other services, reducing operating costs and
identifying operating efficiencies, all of which improve the long-term profitability of the hotel.

Another key component of our asset
management strategy is our capital expenditure programs. These programs are designed to increase profitability by maximizing the value of our portfolio and maintaining our high standards for product quality, as well as those of our managers. We also
continually explore opportunities to utilize our properties, or a portion of our properties, for more valuable or profitable purposes. Our asset management and design and construction departments review potential capital improvements to ensure that
each of our properties is in high-quality physical condition, highly competitive in the market and consistent with brand standards on a continuing basis. Our capital expenditures generally fall into three broad categories: renewal and replacement
expenditures, return on investment (or “ROI”)/repositioning capital expenditures and value enhancement projects.

Renewal and replacement expenditures.

We work closely with our managers to ensure that renewal and replacement expenditures are spent efficiently to maximize the profitability of the hotel. Typically, room
refurbishments occur at intervals of approximately seven years, but the timing may vary based on the type of property and equipment being replaced. These refurbishments generally are divided into the following types: soft goods, hard goods and
infrastructure. Soft goods include items such as carpeting, bed spreads, curtains and wall vinyl and may require more frequent updates to maintain brand quality standards. Hard goods include items such as dressers, desks, couches, restaurant and
meeting room chairs and tables and are generally not replaced as frequently. Infrastructure includes the physical plant of the hotel, including the roof, elevators, façade and fire systems, which are regularly maintained and then replaced at
the end of their useful lives.

ROI/repositioning expenditures.

In addition, we pursue
opportunities to enhance asset value by completing selective capital improvements outside the scope of typical renewal and replacement capital expenditures. These projects include, for example, significant repositionings of guest rooms, lobbies or
food


and beverage platforms and expanding ballroom, spa or conference facilities. In certain instances, these ROI/repositioning projects have coincided with the
timing of regular maintenance cycles at the properties where we have used the opportunity to significantly improve and upgrade the hotel. These projects are also designed to take advantage of changing market conditions and the favorable location of
our properties. Examples of these projects include:

•

the completion of a 105,000 square foot exhibition hall at the Orlando World Center Marriott in 2007;

•

the construction of new food and beverage facilities, renovation of meeting space and the construction of the new 26,000 square foot Atrium Ballroom at the Atlanta
Marriott Marquis in 2007 and 2008; and

•

the construction of an 8,300 square foot meeting space addition and the renovation of over 60,000 square feet of public space and food and beverage facilities at
the San Francisco Marriott in 2008.

Value enhancement projects

.    We also
will continue to seek opportunities to enhance the value of our portfolio by identifying and executing strategies that maximize the highest and best use of all aspects of our properties, such as the development of timeshare or condominium units on
excess land, or the acquisition of air rights or developer entitlements that add value to our portfolio or enhance the value in the event we sell the property. In prior years, this strategy led to the sale of the Marriott Mountain Shadows Resort in
2007, which had been closed since the fourth quarter of 2004, for $42 million and the sale of the Swissôtel, The Drake, New York for approximately $440 million in 2006, which, in both cases, resulted in our realizing a higher
valuation for the property than a typical hotel sale.

Acquisitions.

Our acquisition strategy primarily
focuses on acquiring either directly or through joint ventures, luxury and upper-upscale hotels domestically and internationally. We continue to evaluate potential opportunities to acquire hotels at attractive yields and at discounts to replacement
cost. Our acquisition strategy continues to focus on:

•

properties with locations in markets with high barriers to entry for prospective competitors;

•

properties operated under premium brand names;

•

larger hotels that are consistent with our portfolio objectives and that may require investment on a scale that limits the number of potential buyers;

•

properties that further diversify our portfolio, both domestically and internationally; and

•

acquisitions through various structures, including transactions involving portfolios or single asset transactions.

Domestic Acquisitions

.    Over the last five years, we have acquired 33 properties, including a portfolio of 25
domestic and three foreign properties from Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., (“Starwood”) on April 10, 2006 (collectively, the “Starwood Portfolio”). We did not complete any domestic acquisitions during
2008 due to several factors that became more pronounced as the year progressed. During the first half of 2008, as lodging fundamentals weakened, favorable debt financing became limited and fewer luxury and upper-upscale hotels were being marketed or
sold. During the second half of 2008, as the economic recession became more widespread and the credit markets collapsed, the acquisition/disposition market for these hotels was extremely limited. Management believes that there may be an increase in
the number of assets available for purchase late in 2009 and in 2010 as a result of the current recessionary environment and illiquid credit market.

International Acquisitions

.    During 2007 and 2008, we purchased four hotels through our European joint venture, including the purchase of the 270-room Crowne Plaza Amsterdam City Centre
for approximately €72 million (US $113 million) in April 2008. Our European joint venture now owns 11 hotels in six countries. Additionally, in 2008 we entered into an Asian joint venture as a 25% minority


owner. The Asian joint venture will seek hotel acquisition opportunities in various markets throughout Asia, including China, Japan, Vietnam, India and
Australia. These acquisitions could include mid-scale hotels, as well as luxury and upper-upscale hotels that are our typical focus.

Capital structure and liquidity profile.

Our capital structure is designed to maintain an appropriate balance of debt and equity that will allow us to weather weaker periods of lodging demand and provide us
with substantial flexibility with respect to our sources of capital. Roughly 75% of our debt consists of senior notes which are guaranteed by various subsidiaries and secured by pledges in subsidiaries, but not collateralized by specific hotel
properties. The remainder of our debt consists of mortgage indebtedness which is secured by 14 of our hotels. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 80% of our hotels (measured by revenues) are unencumbered by mortgage debt. The structure of
our balance sheet affords us access to the market for senior notes when pricing is attractive and also provides us with significant flexibility to the extent we determine that it is more appropriate to access the mortgage debt markets.

As a REIT, we are required to distribute 90% of our taxable income (other than net capital gain) to our stockholders, and, as a result, generally must
rely on external sources of capital to finance our growth. Therefore, we will use a variety of debt and equity instruments to fund our external growth including senior notes and mortgage debt, convertible debentures, common and preferred stock
offerings, issuances of Host LP partnership units and joint ventures/limited partnerships to best take advantage of the prevailing market conditions.

Joint Ventures.

We expect to continue to utilize joint ventures to finance external growth. We believe joint ventures provide a significant means to access external capital and
spread the inherent risk of hotel ownership, while continuing to provide significant opportunities for positive returns on investment for our stockholders. Our primary focus for joint ventures is currently in international markets, such as in Europe
and Asia, which will help to diversify our exposure to market risk. We will also explore joint venture opportunities in North America and Latin America. Generally, we intend to earn a promoted interest and a fee for the asset management of the
properties owned by such joint ventures.

Dispositions.

We have taken advantage of market conditions to sell
33 hotels over the past five years, including one property disposed of in 2009 and two properties disposed of in 2008. The ability of prospective purchasers to obtain acquisition financing has been adversely affected by the credit crisis and the
overall lack of available debt. Proceeds from dispositions have been, or will be, used to repay debt, fund acquisitions, fund ROI/repositioning projects, or for general corporate purposes. Generally, the properties that we dispose of are non-core
hotels that are located in secondary and tertiary markets where we believe the potential for growth is lower. However, we will also dispose of core assets when we have the opportunity to capitalize on value enhancement strategies and apply the
proceeds to other business objectives.

Operating Structure

Host is a self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust (“REIT”). Host operates through an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which substantially all of its properties and assets are
held by Host LP, of which Host is the sole general partner and holds approximately 97% of the outstanding partnership interests, with the remaining 3% of the partnership interests held by third parties. Currently, each unit of the partnership
interests in Host LP owned by holders other than Host is redeemable at the option of the holder for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of Host common stock. Host has the right, however, to acquire any unit of Host LP
partnership interest offered for redemption directly from the holder in exchange for one share of Host common stock, instead of Host LP redeeming such partnership interest for cash. When distinguishing between Host and Host LP, the primary
difference is the approximately 3% of the operating partnership interests of Host LP not held by us as of February 23, 2009.


Our operating structure is as follows:

Because Host is a REIT, certain tax laws limit the amount of “non-qualifying” income that Host can
earn, including income derived directly from the operation of hotels. As a result, we lease substantially all of our consolidated properties to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS subsidiaries”) for
federal income tax purposes or to third party lessees. The lessees and our TRS subsidiaries enter into agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the hotels. Our TRS subsidiaries also may hold assets engaging in other activities that
produce non-qualifying income such as the development of timeshare or condominium units, subject to certain restrictions. The difference between the hotels’ net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to Host LP is retained by our TRS
subsidiaries as taxable income. Accordingly, the net effect of the TRS leases is that, while, as a REIT, Host is generally exempt from federal income tax to the extent that we meet specific distribution requirements, among other REIT requirements, a
portion of the net operating cash flow from our properties is subject to federal, state and, if applicable, foreign income tax.

Our Hotel Properties

Overview.

Our lodging portfolio consists of 116 luxury and upper-upscale hotels generally located in the
central business districts of major cities, near airports and resort/conference destinations that, because of their locations, typically benefit from barriers to entry by competitors. These properties typically include meeting and banquet
facilities, a variety of restaurants and lounges, swimming pools, exercise facilities and/or spas, gift shops and parking facilities, the combination of which enable them to serve business, leisure and group travelers. Forty-four of our hotels
representing approximately 63% of our revenues have over 500 rooms. The average age of our properties is 25 years, although most of the properties have benefited from substantial renovations or major additions, as well as regularly scheduled renewal
and replacement and other capital improvements.


The following chart details our hotel portfolio by brand as of February 23, 2009:

(1)

Percentage of revenues is based on 2008 revenues. No individual property contributed more than 7% of total revenues in 2008.


Hotel Properties

.

The following table sets forth the location and number of rooms of our 116 hotels as of February 23, 2009:


(1)

The land on which this hotel is built is leased from a third party under one or more long-term lease agreements.

(2)

The land, building and improvements are leased from a third party under a long-term lease agreement.

(3)

These properties are not wholly owned.

(4)

This property is subject to a ground lease under which we have the option to purchase the land. In prior years, payments under the ground lease, which are determined annually and
are not fixed in nature, reduced the deferred ground rent liability and, in 2008, were applied to the deferred purchase price of the land. Accordingly, no expense was included in our results of operations for ground rent expense in those years. In
2009, a small portion of the payments will fully fund the deferred purchase price and the remainder will be accounted for as ground rent expense. We have the ability to buy the fee simple interest in the land under the hotel for an incremental
payment of $19.9 million through 2017.


Competition

The lodging industry is highly competitive. Competition is often specific to individual markets and
is based on a number of factors, including location, brand, guest facilities and amenities, level of service, room rates and the quality of accommodations. The lodging industry is generally viewed as consisting of six different groupings, each of
which caters to a discrete set of customer taste and needs: luxury, upper-upscale, upscale, midscale (with and without food and beverage service) and economy. Most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties, under
such brand names as Ritz-Carlton

®

, Fairmont

®

, Four Seasons

®

, The
Luxury Collection

®

, St. Regis

®

and W

®

or as upper-upscale properties,
under such brand names as Marriott

®

, Hyatt

®

, Westin

®

, Hilton

®

, Sheraton

®

, Swissôtel

®

and Delta

®

.

(1)

Our hotels compete with other hotels operated under brands in these groupings, as well as with the
upscale or other lower-tier groupings of hotels in certain locations.

We believe our properties enjoy competitive advantages associated
with the hotel brands under which they operate. The international marketing programs and reservation systems of these brands, combined with the strong management systems and expertise they provide, should enable our properties to perform favorably
in terms of both occupancy and room rates. In addition, repeat guest business is enhanced by guest reward or guest recognition programs offered by most of these brands. Nevertheless, many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our
managers from converting, franchising or developing other hotel properties in our markets. As a result, our hotels in a given market often compete with other hotels that our managers may own, invest in, manage or franchise.

We also compete with other REITs and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities both
domestically and internationally as we attempt to position our portfolio to take best advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers.

Seasonality

Our hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate seasonality, which varies based on the individual hotel
property and the region. Additionally, hotel revenues for our Marriott-managed hotels typically reflect approximately 16 weeks of results in the fourth quarter and for 2008 represented approximately 17 weeks, compared to approximately 12 weeks for
each of the first three quarters of the year. For our non-Marriott managed hotels, the first quarter includes two months of operations, the second and third quarters include three months of operations and the fourth quarter includes four months of
operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition – Reporting Periods” for more information on our fiscal calendar. Hotel sales have historically averaged approximately 20%,
26%, 22% and 32% for the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively.

Other Real Estate Investments

In addition to our hotels, we have minority partner interests in other real estate investments. We manage these investments and conduct business through a
combination of general and limited partnership and limited liability company interests. All of the debt of these entities is non-recourse to us and our subsidiaries, and the entities are not consolidated in our financial statements.

European Joint Venture

We currently
own a 32.1% limited and general partnership interest in a joint venture in Europe (the “European joint venture”) with Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, a Dutch pension fund, and Jasmine Hotels Pte Ltd, an affiliate of GIC Real Estate Pte Ltd,
the real estate investment company of the Government of Singapore

(1)

This annual report contains registered trademarks that are the exclusive property of their respective owners, which are
companies other than us. None of the owners of these trademarks, their affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, agents or employees, has or will have any responsibility or liability for any information contained in this annual
report.


Investment Corporation Pte Ltd. The initial term of the European joint venture is ten years subject to two one-year extensions with partner approval. Due to
the ownership structure of the European joint venture and the non-Host limited partners’ rights to cause the dissolution and liquidation of the European joint venture at any time, it is not consolidated in our financial statements. The European
joint venture’s previously announced agreement to purchase six hotels in France, Germany and The Netherlands for approximately €565 million did not close because of a disagreement between the parties over the completion of certain
capital improvements that were a condition to closing. As of February 23, 2009, the European joint venture owns the following eleven hotels in six countries:

Asian Joint Venture

On March 25, 2008, we entered into a joint venture, structured as a Singapore Corporation, with RECO Hotels JV Private Limited, an affiliate of GIC
RE (the “Asian joint venture”). The Asian joint venture will explore investment opportunities in various markets throughout Asia, including China, Japan, Vietnam, India and Australia. We own a 25% interest in the Asian joint venture. The
initial term of the Asian joint venture is for a period of seven years. Due to the ownership structure of the Asian joint venture, and our partner’s rights to cause the dissolution and liquidation of the Asian joint venture at any time, it is
not consolidated in our financial statements. Currently, the Asian joint venture does not own any hotels.

Other Investments

We currently own a 3.6% limited partner interest in CBM Joint Venture Limited Partnership, which owns 115 Courtyard by Marriott
properties. We have the right to cause the partnership to redeem our limited partner interest under certain conditions prior to December 2009. Thereafter, the general partner of the partnership has the right to redeem our remaining interest.

We own a leasehold interest in 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties and 18 Residence Inn by Marriott properties (the “HPT
Properties”), which were sold to Hospitality Properties Trust, Inc. and leased back prior to 1997. In 1998, we subleased these 71 properties to a third party on similar terms with initial terms expiring between 2010 and 2012. The subleases are
renewable at our option. Rent payable under the subleases is guaranteed by the subtenant up to a maximum of $30 million. At the expiration of these leases, the third party owners of these properties will return our initial security deposit of
approximately $67 million plus additional security deposits of approximately $8 million. During 2008, we gave notice that we will not renew the lease on the 18 Residence Inn properties and therefore that lease will terminate in December
2010, at which time we expect our approximate $17 million security deposit to be returned by HPT Properties.

We also have a 49%
limited partner interest in Tiburon Golf Ventures, L.P., which owns the golf club surrounding The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort, Naples. For additional detail of our other real estate investments,


including a summary of the outstanding debt balances of our affiliates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition—Investments in Affiliates” and Note 3 “Investments in Affiliates” and Note 7 “Leases” in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Foreign Operations

Excluding hotels owned by our
European joint venture, we currently own four properties in Canada, one in Mexico and two in Chile, which collectively contain approximately 2,500 rooms. Approximately 3% of our revenues were attributed to the foreign operations of these properties
in each of 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Environmental and Regulatory Matters

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or
toxic substances on, under or in such property. These laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain environmental laws and
common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released
asbestos-containing materials. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures. In connection with our
current or prior ownership or operation of hotels, we may be potentially liable for various environmental costs or liabilities. Although we are currently not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us, we can offer
no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future.

Operational Agreements

All of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management agreements or operating and license agreements (See “Operating
Structure”). As of February 23, 2009, twenty-two of our hotels operated by Starwood, our Embassy Suites Chicago Hotel, Downtown/Lakefront, our San Francisco Marriott Fisherman’s Wharf and our Hilton Singer Island Oceanfront Resort are
operated pursuant to operating and license agreements, while our remaining hotels are operated pursuant to management agreements, the provisions of which are described in more detail below. Under these agreements, the managers or operators generally
have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the day-to-day operation of the hotels, including establishing all room rates, processing reservations, procuring inventories, supplies and services, providing
periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers’ technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels. In addition, the manager or operator provides all managerial and other employees for the
hotels, reviews the operation and maintenance of the hotels, prepares reports, budgets and projections, and provides other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels. Generally, these support services include planning and policy
services, financial planning, divisional financial services, product planning and development, employee staffing and training, corporate executive management and certain in-house legal services. For the majority of our properties, we have approval
rights over the budget, capital expenditures and other matters.

Management Agreements

.    Our management
agreements typically include the terms described below:

•

Term and fees for operational services

.    The initial term of our management agreements generally is 15 to 20 years with one or more
renewal terms. The manager receives compensation in the form of a base management fee which is calculated as a percentage (typically 3%) of annual gross revenues, and an incentive management fee, which is typically calculated as a percentage
(generally 20%) of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel.

•

Chain services

.    The management agreements require the managers to furnish chain services that are generally furnished on a centralized
basis. Such services include: (1) the development and operation of


certain computer systems and reservation services, (2) regional management and administrative services, regional marketing and sales services, regional
training services, manpower development and relocation of regional personnel and (3) such additional central or regional services as may from time to time be more efficiently performed on a regional or group basis rather than at an individual
hotel. Costs and expenses incurred in providing these services are generally allocated among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates that benefit from these services.

•

Working capital and fixed asset supplies

.    Our management agreements typically require us to maintain working capital for each hotel
and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies (for example, linen, china, glassware, silver and uniforms). We are also responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from hotel
operations are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels.

•

Furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements

.    Under the management agreements, we are required to provide to the managers all
necessary furniture, fixtures and equipment for the operation of the hotels (including funding any required furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements). The management agreements generally provide that, on an annual basis, the manager will
prepare a list of furniture, fixtures and equipment to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the funds that are necessary, which is subject to our review and approval. For
purposes of funding the furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements, a specified percentage (typically 5%) of the gross revenues of the hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow account in our name, to which the manager has access.
However, for 64 of our hotels, we have entered into an agreement with Marriott International to allow us to fund such expenditures directly as incurred from one account that we control, subject to maintaining a minimum balance of the greater of
$33.9 million, or 30% of total annual specified contributions, rather than escrowing funds at accounts at each hotel.

•

Building alterations, improvements and renewals

.    The management agreements require the managers to prepare an annual estimate of the
expenditures necessary for major repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals and replacements to the structural, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and elevators of each hotel which we review and approve based
on their recommendations and our judgment. In addition to the foregoing, the management agreements generally provide that the manager may propose such changes, alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required, in the manager’s
reasonable judgment, to keep the hotel in a competitive, efficient and economical operating condition consistent with the manager’s brand standards. We generally have approval authority over such changes, alterations and improvements.

•

Service marks

.    During the term of the management agreements, the brand name, service mark, symbols and logos used by the manager may
be used in the operation of the hotel. Any right to use the brand name, service marks, logos and symbols and related trademarks at a hotel will terminate with respect to that hotel upon termination of the applicable management or franchise
agreement.

•

Sale of the hotel.

Most of the management agreements limit our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the hotels by requiring
that the transferee assume the related management agreements and meet specified other conditions, including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager.

•

Termination on sale

.    While most of our management agreements are not terminable prior to their full term, we have negotiated rights
with respect to 21 specified Marriott-branded hotels to terminate management agreements in connection with the sale of these hotels subject to certain limitations, including the number of agreements that can be terminated per year, limitations
measured by EBITDA, and limitations requiring that a significant part of such hotels maintain the Marriott brand affiliation. The described termination rights may be exercised without payment of a termination fee except for one of the specified
hotels wherein a termination fee is required if it does not maintain the Marriott brand affiliation.


•

Performance termination

.    The majority of our management agreements provide for termination rights in the case of a manager’s
prolonged failure to meet certain financial performance criteria, generally a set return on the owners’ investment. We have agreed in the past, and may agree in the future, to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for
consideration from the hotel manager, which could take the form of cash compensation or amendments to the management agreement. Similarly, the majority of our management agreements condition the manager’s right to renew pre-determined extension
terms upon satisfaction of certain financial performance criteria.

Operating and License
Agreements.

Our operating and license agreements with Starwood (the operator with which we have the vast majority of these agreements) typically include the terms described below:

•

Term and fees for operational services

.    The initial term of our operating agreements is 20 years, with two renewal terms of 10 years
each at the option of the operator. The operator receives compensation in the form of a base fee of 1% of annual gross operating revenues and an incentive fee of 20% of annual gross operating profit, after the owner has received a priority return of
10.75% on its purchase price and other investments in the hotels.

•

License services

.    The license agreements address matters relating to the subject brand,
including rights to use service marks, logos, symbols and trademarks, such as those associated with Westin

®

, Sheraton

®

and W

®

, as well as matters relating to compliance with certain standards and policies and (including through other agreements in the case of certain hotels) the provision of certain system program and
centralized services. The license agreements have an initial term of 20 years each, with two renewal terms of 10 years each at the option of the licensor. Licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees of 5% of gross operating revenue
attributable to room sales and 2% of gross operating revenue attributable to food and beverage sales.

•

Programs and services

.    The licensor or operator provides certain system programs and services to all or substantially all of our
Starwood hotels by brand in a licensed area. Such services include participation in reservation services and the marketing program as well as the Starwood Preferred Guest Program. In addition to these services, under the operating agreements,
centralized operating services are furnished to hotels by brand on a system basis. Costs and expenses incurred in providing such system programs and services and centralized operating services under the license and operating agreements or other
agreements are fairly allocated among all hotels in the applicable brand operated or licensed by Starwood or its affiliates.

•

Working capital and fixed asset supplies

.    The operating agreements require us to maintain working capital funds for each hotel to fund
the cost of certain fixed asset supplies and to meet the ongoing cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from hotel operations are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels. For 18 of our hotels, the
working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by Starwood operators for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis, with operators being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with
respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the operating agreements.

•

Furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements

.    Under the operating and license agreements, we are required to provide all necessary
furniture, fixtures and equipment for the operation of the hotels (including funding for any required furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements). To fund these items each month, the operator transfers into a reserve fund account an amount equal
to 5% of the gross operating revenue of a hotel for the previous month. For 18 of our hotels, the periodic reserve fund contributions which would otherwise be deposited into reserve fund accounts maintained by operators for each hotel are
distributed to us, and we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which would otherwise be funded from the reserve funds for each of the subject hotels as such expenditures become necessary. In addition to routine capital expenditures,
the reserve funds for the hotels may also be used for building capital improvements. Any approved reserve funding in excess of amounts


available in the pooled reserve funds is funded by us and results in appropriate increases of owner’s investment and owner’s priority amounts. For
18 hotels, the amount of any such additional reserve funding will be allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis, determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all hotels for the
most recent operating year. Any such additional reserve funding will result in corresponding increases in the owner’s investment and owner’s priority amounts with respect to each of such hotels.

•

Building alterations, improvements and renewals

.    The operating agreements require the operators to prepare an annual operating plan
that includes an estimate of the expenditures necessary for maintenance, repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals and replacements to the structural, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and elevators of each
hotel, which plan and proposed expenditures we review and approve based on the operator’s recommendations and our judgment.

•

Territorial

.    The operating agreements provide area restrictions for a period of either five or 10 years which limit the operator and
its affiliates from owning, operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand in the area. The area restrictions vary with each hotel, from city blocks in urban areas to up to a 10 mile radius from the hotel in other areas.

•

Sale of the hotel/other

.    The license agreements limit our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the hotels. Generally, the
agreements require that the transferee assume the related operating agreement and meet specified other conditions, including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the licensor. The operating agreements provide for termination
rights beginning in 2016 in the case of the operator’s failure to meet certain financial performance criteria. Generally, such rights arise in the event that the operator fails, for two consecutive years, to generate operating profit equal to
or greater than a specified percentage of the owner’s investment in the hotel, and the RevPAR performance of the hotel falls below that of other competitive hotels in the market during such two-year period.

•

Termination on sale

.    As of February 23, 2009, we have termination rights relating to the operating agreements on 12 specified
hotels upon the sale of those hotels. Such termination rights are currently active with respect to three of such hotels. With respect to two of those hotels, we have the limited right to also terminate one license agreement annually. With respect to
nine of the 12 specified hotels, we have the right beginning in 2016 to sell 35% of such hotels (measured by EBITDA), not to exceed two hotels annually, free and clear of the existing operating agreement over a period of time without the payment of
a termination fee. With respect to any termination of an operating agreement on sale, the proposed purchaser would need to meet the requirements for transfer under the applicable license agreement.

Employees

On February 23, 2009, we had 215
employees, including three at our London, England office, one at our Amsterdam, The Netherlands office and four at our Republic of Singapore office. Employees at our consolidated hotels are employed by the operators that manage our hotels.

None of our direct employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. However, certain of our third-party managed hotels are
covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to review and renewal on a regular basis. For a discussion of these relationships see “Risk Factors—We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel,
particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.”

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The statements in this section
describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.


Forward Looking Statements

Our disclosure and analysis in this 2008 Form 10-K and in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders contain some forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and
assumptions. From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public. Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current
facts. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify each such statement by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,”
“will,” “target,” “forecast” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future
acquisitions or dispositions, future capital expenditure plans, future performance or results of current and anticipated expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statements will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions.
Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions, including the risk factors discussed below. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove
inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are
advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make or related subjects in our 10-Q and 8-K reports to the SEC. Also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions
relevant to our businesses. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or
uncertainties.

Financial Risks and Risks of Operation

Current economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.

The United States
economy is currently in the midst of a recession and the future economic environment is likely to be less favorable than that of recent years. This recession has and could further lead to reduced consumer and commercial spending in the foreseeable
future. The performance of the lodging industry has historically been closely linked with the performance of the general economy and, specifically, growth in the United States gross domestic product, business investment and employment growth. As a
result, the lodging industry may experience significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. In addition, the vast majority of our hotels are classified as luxury or upper-upscale hotels. In
an economic downturn, these types of hotels are likely to be more susceptible to a decrease in revenue, as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates. Declines in demand and in consumer and commercial spending may drive us and
our competitors to reduce pricing, which would have a negative impact on our gross profit. A continued weakening of the economy may adversely and materially affect our industry, business and results of operations and we can not accurately predict
how severe and prolonged any downturn might be. Moreover, reduced revenues as a result of the weakening economy may also reduce our working capital and impact our long-term business strategy.

Our revenues and the value of our properties are also subject to other conditions affecting the lodging industry.

The lodging industry is also subject to changes in travel patterns of business and leisure travelers, both of which are affected by the strength of the
economy, as discussed above, as well as other factors. Changes in travel


patterns of both business and leisure travelers may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term and adversely affect our results. Our results of
operations, and any forecast we make, may be affected and can change based on the following risks:

•

changes in the international, national, regional and local economic climate;

•

changes in business and leisure travel patterns;

•

the effect of terrorist attacks and terror alerts in the United States and internationally, as well as other geopolitical disturbances

•

supply growth in markets where we own hotels which may adversely affect demand at our properties;

•

the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to our competition;

•

the performance of the managers of our hotels;

•

changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors; and

•

unionization of the labor force at our hotels.

The recent disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our business and results of operations, our ability to obtain financing on reasonable and acceptable terms, our ability to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk and
the market price of our common stock.

The United States and global stock and credit markets have recently experienced significant price
volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective and outstanding debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially
impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings materially less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the lack of availability of certain types of financing. Continued uncertainty in the stock and credit
markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional short-term and long-term financing on reasonable terms or at all, which would negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition. A prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets
may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business operations accordingly. In addition, if one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facility
fails, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under the credit facility. Similarly, if one or more of the financial institutions that support our currency hedging arrangements fails, we may not
be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to hedge the foreign currency exchange risk relating to our international operations and may cause a default under our existing financing agreements. These disruptions in the
financial markets also may adversely affect our credit rating and the market value of our common stock. In addition, if the current pressures on credit continue or worsen, we may not be able to refinance, if necessary, our outstanding debt when due,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt servicing and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, if our
operating results worsen significantly and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

We depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be unable to access capital when necessary.

Unlike regular C corporations, we must finance our growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because we are required to
distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income (other than net capital gain) in order to qualify as a REIT, including taxable income we recognize for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash. Our
ability to access the external capital we require could be hampered by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including


declining credit market conditions as discussed above, unfavorable market perception of our growth potential, decreases in our current and estimated future
earnings, or decreases in the market price of Host’s common stock. In addition, our ability to access additional capital may also be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness, which, under certain circumstances, restricts our incurrence
of debt and the payment of distributions. The occurrence of any of these above-mentioned factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us or at all
and the failure to obtain necessary external capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth.

We have
substantial debt.

As of December 31, 2008, we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately $6.0 billion. Our
substantial indebtedness has important consequences. It currently requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital,
capital expenditures, expansion efforts, dividends and other general purposes. Additionally, it could:

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;

•

limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or obtain financing for expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general business
purposes on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all; or

•

affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions.

If our cash flow and working capital were not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness, we would have to raise additional funds
through:

•

sales of our equity;

•

the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by Host LP; or

•

the sale of our assets.

We cannot
make any assurances that any of these sources of funds would be available to us or, if available, would be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan.

The terms of our debt place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, reducing operational flexibility and creating default risks.

The documents governing the terms of our existing senior notes and our credit facility contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our
subsidiaries. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:

•

conduct acquisitions, mergers or consolidations unless the successor entity in such transaction assumes our indebtedness;

•

incur additional debt in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics;

•

create liens securing indebtedness, unless an effective provision is made to secure our other indebtedness by such liens;

•

sell assets without using the proceeds from such sales for certain permitted uses or to make an offer to repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness;

•

make capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds;


•

pay dividends without satisfying certain financial metrics; and

•

conduct transactions with affiliates other than on an arms length basis and, in certain instances, without obtaining opinions as to the fairness of such
transactions.

In addition, certain covenants in the credit facility require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial
performance tests. If we fail to meet such tests, the restrictive covenants in the applicable indenture(s), the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt (including our mortgage debt) will reduce our flexibility in conducting our
operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the
acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt. For a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Financial Condition”.

Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness or
preferred stock.

We are, and may in the future become, party to agreements and instruments that restrict or prevent the payment of
dividends on our classes and series of capital stock. Under the terms of Host LP’s credit facility and senior notes indenture, distributions to Host by Host LP, upon which Host depends in order to obtain the cash necessary to pay dividends, are
permitted only to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, Host LP can satisfy certain financial covenant tests (concerning leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage) and meet other requirements.

In addition, under the terms of our outstanding Class E Preferred Stock, we are not permitted to pay dividends on our common stock unless all cumulative
dividends have been paid (or funds for payment have been set aside for payment). The amount of aggregate dividends that accrue on the Class E Preferred Stock each quarter is approximately $2.2 million. In the event that we fail to pay the
accrued dividends on our Class E Preferred Stock for any reason, including any restriction on paying such dividends under the terms of our debt instruments (as discussed above), dividends will continue to accrue on such preferred stock and we will
be prohibited from paying any dividends on our common stock until all such accrued but unpaid dividends on our Class E Preferred Stock have been paid (or funds for such payment have been set aside).

Defaulting on our mortgage debt could adversely affect our business.

As of December 31, 2008, 14 of our hotels and assets related thereto are subject to mortgages in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion. Although the debt is generally non-recourse to us, if these
hotels do not produce adequate cash flow to service the debt secured by such mortgages, the mortgage lenders could call a default on these assets. Generally, we would expect to negotiate with the lender prior to the occurrence of a default in the
pursuit of other options such as a deed in lieu of foreclosure. However, we may opt to allow such default to occur rather than make the necessary mortgage payments with funds from other sources. Host LP’s senior notes indenture and credit
facility contain cross-default provisions, which, depending upon the amount of secured debt in default, could cause a cross-default under both of these agreements. Host LP’s credit facility, which contains a more restrictive cross-default
provision than the senior notes indenture, provides that a credit facility default occurs in the event Host LP defaults on non-recourse secured indebtedness in excess of 1% of its total assets (using undepreciated real estate values), or defaults on
other indebtedness in excess of $50 million. For this and other reasons, permitting a default could adversely affect our long-term business prospects.

Our mortgage debt contains provisions that may reduce our liquidity.

Certain of our mortgage debt requires that, to the
extent cash flow from the hotels which secure such debt drops below stated levels, we escrow cash flow after the payment of debt service until operations improve above the stated levels. In some cases, the lender has the right to apply the escrowed
amount to the outstanding balance


of the mortgage debt. When such provisions are triggered, there can be no assurance that the affected properties will achieve the minimum cash flow levels
required to trigger a release of any escrowed funds. The amounts required to be escrowed may be material and may negatively affect our liquidity by limiting our access to cash flow after debt service from these mortgaged properties.

An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on our credit facility and any variable rate debt we incur and could adversely impact our ability to
refinance existing debt or sell assets.

For borrowings on our credit facility and the $300 million mortgage on our Orlando World Center
Marriott, interest payments are based on floating rates. To the extent we draw on the credit facility, an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes including investments in our portfolio. Further,
rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced. We may from time to time enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other
interest rate hedging contracts. While these agreements may lessen the impact of rising interest rates, they also expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable. In addition,
an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy.

Rating agency downgrades may increase our cost of capital.

Both our senior notes and our preferred stock are rated by Moody’s Investors’ Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. These independent rating agencies may elect to downgrade their ratings on our senior notes
and our preferred stock at any time. Such downgrades may negatively affect our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of capital.

Our
expenses may not decrease if our revenue decreases.

Many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels, such as debt
service payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the hotels. Our expenses will also be affected by
inflationary increases, and certain costs, such as wages, benefits and insurance, may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period and, in the event of a significant decrease in demand, we may not be able to downsize employees to decrease wages
and benefits. Our managers may be unable to offset any such increased expenses with higher room rates. Any of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures could also adversely affect the future growth of
our business and the value of our hotel properties.

Our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity,
financial position and/or results of operations.

As part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire luxury and upper upscale hotel
properties. We may acquire properties through various structures, including transactions involving portfolios, single assets, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs or similar real
estate entities. We anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods, including proceeds from Host equity offerings, issuance of limited partnership interests of Host LP, advances under our credit facility, the
incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sales of assets. Recent declines in credit markets may limit our ability to finance acquisitions. In addition, the decline in credit markets may limit the ability of purchasers to
finance hotels and adversely affect our disposition strategy and our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance acquisitions.

We may,
from time to time, be in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions and we expect to continue to do so in the future. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be


successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from the acquisitions that we
consummate. Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms, or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position
and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities.

We do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels.

Since
federal income tax laws restrict REITs and their subsidiaries from operating or managing a hotel, we do not operate or manage our hotels. Instead, we lease substantially all of our hotels to subsidiaries which qualify as “taxable REIT
subsidiaries” under applicable REIT laws, and our taxable REIT subsidiaries retain third-party managers to operate our hotels pursuant to management agreements. Our cash flow from the hotels may be adversely affected if our managers fail to
provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name. While our taxable REIT subsidiaries monitor the hotel managers’ performance, we have limited recourse under our management agreements
if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately. In addition, from time to time, we have had, and continue to have, differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our
management agreements. We generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations. However, if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit
the matter to third-party dispute resolution. Failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our hotel managers or their affiliates
manage, and in some cases own, have invested in or provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our hotels, which may result in conflicts of interest. As a result, our hotel managers have in the past made and may in
the future make decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interests.

We are subject to risks associated
with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.

We have entered into management
agreements with third-party managers to operate our hotel properties. Our third-party managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. Although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our hotels, we
are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly those hotels with unionized labor. From time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted through strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or
other negative actions and publicity. We may also incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes or other events. Additionally, hotels where our managers have collective bargaining agreements with employees
(approximately 21% of our current portfolio, by revenues) are more highly affected by labor force activities than others. In addition, the resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, either by
increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. Furthermore, labor agreements may limit the ability of our managers to reduce the size of hotel workforces during an economic downturn because collective
bargaining agreements are negotiated between the managers of our hotels and labor unions. We do not have the ability to control the outcome of these negotiations.

Our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures to remain competitive in the marketplace, maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations. The timing and costs of
such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments.

In addition to capital expenditures required by our loan agreements or agreements with our hotel managers, we will need to make capital expenditures to remain competitive with other hotels, to maintain the economic
value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The timing of these improvements can


affect hotel performance particularly if the improvements require closures of a significant number of rooms or the closure of other features of the hotels
such as ballrooms, meeting space and restaurants. These capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays. In addition, because we depend on external sources of capital, we may not
have the necessary funds to invest and if we fail to maintain our properties in accordance with brand standards set by our managers, the manager may terminate the management agreement. Moreover, we may not necessarily realize a significant, or any,
improvement in the performance of the hotels in which we make these investments.

The expansion of our business into new markets outside of the United
States will expose us to risks relating to owning hotels in those international markets.

Part of our business strategy is to expand our
presence internationally through joint ventures. In addition, we own directly seven hotels located outside the United States. We may have difficulty managing our expansion into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding
of the local economy, an absence of business relationships in the area, or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures and regulations. There are risks inherent in conducting business internationally, which include:

•

employment laws and practices;

•

tax laws which may provide for income or other tax rates that exceed those of the U.S. and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to dividend
withholding requirements or other restrictions;

•

compliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy;

•

the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability, cost and terms of such financing;

•

adverse changes in local, political, economic and market conditions;

•

insurance coverage related to terrorist events;

•

changes in interest rates and/or the currency exchange rates;

•

regulations regarding the incurrence of debts; and

•

difficulties in complying with U.S. rules governing REITs while operating internationally.

Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international expansion. If we do not effectively
manage our geographic expansion and successfully integrate the foreign hotels into our organization, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected and the value of Host common stock may decline.

We may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts.

We have made a significant investment in a European joint venture, which owns eleven hotels in Europe. In addition, we have formed another joint venture
to explore investment opportunities in Asia and Australia. We may, from time to time, invest as a co-venturer in other entities holding hotel properties instead of purchasing hotel properties directly. Co-venturers often share control over the
operation of a joint venture. Actions by a co-venturer could subject the assets to additional risk as a result of any of the following circumstances:

•

our co-venturer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our, or the joint venture’s, interests or goals; or

•

our co-venturer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives.

Although we generally will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture to permit our objectives to be
achieved, we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners.


Our management agreements could affect the sale or financing of our hotels.

Under the terms of our management agreements, we generally may not sell, lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor
of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions. Our ability to finance or sell our properties, depending upon the structure of such transactions, may require the manager’s
consent. If the manager does not consent to such sale or financing, we may be precluded from taking actions in our best interest.

The acquisition
contracts relating to some hotels limit our ability to sell or refinance those hotels.

For reasons relating to federal and state income
tax considerations of the former and current owners of three hotels, we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels, or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel. Two of these agreements will expire
in 2010 and the third will expire in 2028. As a result, even if it were in our best interests to sell these hotels or repay or otherwise reduce the level of the mortgage debt on such hotels, it may be difficult or costly to do so during their
respective lock-out periods. In specified circumstances, we may agree to similar restrictions in connection with future hotel acquisitions.

Future
terrorist attacks or changes in terror alert levels could adversely affect us.

Previous terrorist attacks in the United States and
subsequent terrorist alerts have adversely affected the travel and hospitality industries over the past several years. The impact that terrorist attacks in the United States or elsewhere could have on domestic and international markets and our
business in particular is indeterminable. It is possible that such attacks or the threat of such attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to finance our business, our ability to insure our properties and/or our
results of operations and financial condition as a whole.

We may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance for losses caused
by some types of terrorist acts, and federal terrorism legislation does not ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future.

We obtain terrorism insurance as part of our all-risk property insurance program, as well as our general liability and directors’ and officers’
coverages. However, our all-risk policies have limitations such as per occurrence limits, annual aggregate coverage limits and sublimits which might have to be shared proportionally across participating hotels under certain loss scenarios. Also,
all-risk insurers only have to provide terrorism coverage to the extent mandated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (“TRIPRA”) effective December 26, 2007. Property damage related to war and to nuclear,
radiological, biological and chemical incidents is excluded under our policies. While TRIPRA will reimburse insurers for losses resulting from nuclear, radiological, biological and chemical perils, TRIPRA does not require insurers to offer coverage
for these perils and, to date, insurers are not willing to provide this coverage, even with government reinsurance. Host has a wholly-owned captive insurance company through which it obtains a policy of nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological
(“NBCR”) coverage. This captive insurer has the same ability as other insurance companies to apply to the US Treasury for reimbursement, as provided for in TRIPRA, and is subject to the same deductibles and co-insurance obligations. This
potential reimbursement applies to property insurance only, and not to general liability or directors’ and officers’ insurance, and there are no assurances that we will be able to recover any or all of our NCBR losses under this program.

Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.

We, or our hotel managers, carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties. These policies offer
coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar type properties. Generally, our “all-risk” property policies provide coverage that is available on a per occurrence basis and that, for each occurrence, has


an overall limit, as well as various sub-limits, on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive. Sub-limits exist for certain types of claims such as
service interruption, abatement, expediting costs, landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes. The dollar amounts of these sub-limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage
limit. In this regard, hotels in certain of our markets, including California and Florida have in the past and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from earthquakes and hurricanes. Recovery under the applicable policies is also subject
to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income. There is no assurance that this insurance, where maintained, will fully fund the re-building or restoration of a hotel impacted by an earthquake, hurricane or other natural
disasters, or the income lost as a result of the damage. Our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether
the aggregate limits and sub-limits contained in our policies have been exceeded and, in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage, any such claims will also be combined with the claims of other owners participating in
the managers’ program for the same purpose. Therefore, if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels, or, in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the management company, affects hotels owned by others, the
claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. Each affected hotel may only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance
proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available. We may incur losses in excess of insured limits and, as a result, we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that
affect multiple properties such as earthquakes, hurricanes or certain types of terrorism.

In addition, there are other risks, such as
certain environmental hazards, that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage. We may also encounter challenges with an insurance provider
regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy. Should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur, or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier, we
could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to
the property.

Finally, the current disruption in financial markets makes it more difficult to evaluate the stability and net assets or
capitalization of insurance companies, and any insurer’s ability to meet its claim payment obligations.

Litigation judgments or settlements could
have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition.

We are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of
business. We are vigorously defending each of these claims. Currently, none of these claims seeks relief that, if granted, would have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, we could become the subject of
claims by the operators of our hotels, individuals or companies who use our hotels, our investors, or regulating entities, which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and performance.

We may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to hotels or businesses we acquire.

Assets and entities that we have acquired or may in the future acquire may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no
recourse, or only limited recourse, against the sellers. In general, the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements may not survive the closing of the transactions. While we usually require the sellers to indemnify us
with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive, such indemnification is often limited and subject to various materiality thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses. As a result, there is no guarantee
that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties. In addition, the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with
acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations, plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects, all


of which may adversely affect our revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition. Finally, indemnification agreements between us and the
sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us. While the sellers are generally contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such
retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations, materiality thresholds, deductibles or caps on losses, there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses as well.

We depend on our key personnel.

Our success depends
on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. None of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers. We cannot assure you that these key personnel
will remain employed by us. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance.

Exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results.

As a result of the expansion of Host’s international operations, currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect its results of operations and financial position. Host expects to generate an increasing portion
of its revenue and its expenses in such foreign currencies as the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso, the British Pound, the Polish Zloty and the Chilean Peso. Although Host may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial
institutions to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and other foreign currencies, these hedging transactions, if entered into, will not eliminate that risk entirely. In addition, to the extent that Host is unable to match
revenue received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on Host’s results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, because Host’s consolidated
financial results are reported in US Dollars, if Host generates revenues or earnings in other currencies, the translation of those results into US Dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those revenues or earnings.

Applicable REIT laws may restrict certain business activities.

As a REIT we are subject to various restrictions on our income, assets and activities. Business activities that could be impacted by applicable REIT laws include, but are not limited to, activities such as developing
alternative uses of real estate, including the development and/or sale of timeshare or condominium units. Due to these restrictions, we anticipate that we will conduct certain business activities, including those mentioned above, in one or more of
our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries are taxable as regular C corporations and are subject to federal, state, local, and, if applicable, foreign taxation on their taxable income at applicable corporate income tax rates.

We may be unable to sell properties because real estate investments are inherently illiquid.

Real estate properties generally cannot be sold quickly and, accordingly, we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or
other conditions. The inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to service our debt. In addition, there are limitations under the federal income tax
laws applicable to REITs that may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets.

Our ground lease payments may
increase faster than the revenues we receive on the hotels situated on the leased properties.

As of December 31, 2008, 35 of our
hotels are subject to third-party ground leases (encumbering all or a portion of the hotel). These ground leases generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments, which


are often based on economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index. Our ability to pay ground rental could be adversely affected to the extent that our
revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases. In addition, if we were to sell a hotel encumbered by a ground lease, the buyer would have to assume the ground lease, which may
result in a lower sales price.

Environmental problems are possible and can be costly.

We believe that our properties comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws. Unidentified environmental liabilities could arise,
however, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real
estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property. The owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation
costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more
than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for
damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos
properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation
or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated
with exposure to asbestos fibers.

Compliance with other government regulations can be costly.

Our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, building codes and regulations
pertaining to fire safety. Compliance with those laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. These regulations may be changed from time to time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance,
including potential litigation. Any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Risks of Ownership of Host’s Common Stock

There are limitations on the acquisition of Host common stock and changes in control.

Host’s charter and bylaws, the partnership agreement of Host LP, and the Maryland General Corporation Law contain a number of
provisions, the exercise or existence of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or Host LP unit holders or otherwise be in their best interests, including the
following:

•

Restrictions on ownership and transfer of Host’s stock.

To maintain Host’s qualification as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, not more than 50% in value of Host’s outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned in the last half of the taxable year, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, which, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code (the
“Code”), may include certain entities. Because such ownership could jeopardize Host’s qualification as a REIT, a person cannot own, directly or by attribution, 10% or more of an interest in a Host lessee, nor can a Host lessee of any
partnership in which Host is a partner own, directly or by attribution, 10% or more of Host’s shares, in each case unless exempted by Host’s Board of Directors.

Host’s charter prohibits ownership, directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, by any person or persons acting as a group, of
more than 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more


restrictive, of shares of Host’s outstanding common stock, preferred stock or any other stock, each considered as a separate class or series for this
purpose. Together, these limitations are referred to as the “ownership limit.”

Stock acquired or held in violation of the
ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the person who acquired the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon, to vote
those shares of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares of Host’s stock to a person who, as a
result of the transfer, violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances, and, in any event, would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of Host’s stock in excess of the ownership limit. These
restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if Host’s Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT.

•

Removal of Board of Directors.

Host’s charter provides that, except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or
series of shares of capital stock other than common stock, directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.
Vacancies on Host’s Board of Directors may be filled by the concurring vote of a majority of the remaining directors (except that a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors must be filled by a majority vote of the entire
Board of Directors) and, in the case of a vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders, by at least two-thirds of votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.

•

Preferred shares; classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval.

Host’s
charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that we have authority to issue is 800,000,000, initially consisting of 750,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Host’s Board of
Directors has the authority, without a vote of stockholders, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock, including common stock into preferred stock or vice versa, and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred or other
class or series of shares to be issued. Because the Board of Directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of additional classes or series of stock without a stockholder vote, Host’s Board of Directors may give the holders of
any class or series of stock preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of existing stock.

•

Maryland business combination law.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, specified “business combinations,” including
specified issuances of equity securities, between a Maryland corporation and any person who owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation’s then outstanding shares, or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who at any time
during the two year period prior to the date in question owned 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the corporation (each, an “interested stockholder”), or an affiliate of the interested stockholder, are prohibited
for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Thereafter, any of these specified business combinations must be approved by 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of
outstanding voting shares and by two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of voting shares other than voting shares held by an interested stockholder unless, among other conditions, the corporation’s common stockholders
receive a minimum price, as defined in the Maryland General Corporation Law, for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder. As a Maryland corporation, Host is subject
to the Maryland business combination statute. The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an
interested stockholder. The Board of Directors has not granted any such exceptions at this time.

•

Maryland control share acquisition law.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, “control shares” acquired in a
“control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by


a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquiror, by officers or by directors who are employees of
the corporation. “Control shares” are voting shares which, if aggregated with all other voting shares previously acquired by the acquiror or over which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely
by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power: (1) one-tenth or more but less than one-third, (2) one-third or more but less
than a majority or (3) a majority or more of the voting power. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A “control share
acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares, subject to specified exceptions. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of Maryland law. There can be no assurance that this provision will not be
amended or eliminated at any time in the future.

•

Merger, consolidation, share exchange and transfer of Host’s assets.

Under Maryland law and Host’s charter, subject to the
terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock, we can merge with or into another entity, consolidate with one or more other entities, participate in a share exchange or transfer Host’s assets within the meaning of the Maryland
General Corporation Law if approved (1) by Host’s Board of Directors in the manner provided in the Maryland General Corporation Law and (2) by Host’s stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the
matter, except that any merger of Host with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing Host’s form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires only the approval of Host’s stockholders holding a majority of all votes
entitled to be cast on the merger. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange is only required to be approved by a Maryland corporation by its Board of Directors
if the corporation is the successor entity. Host’s voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.

•

Certain charter and bylaw amendments.

Host’s charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transferability of
Host’s stock, fixing the size of the Board of Directors within the range set forth in the charter, removal of directors, the filling of vacancies, exculpation and indemnification of directors, calling special stockholder meetings and others,
all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by Host’s stockholders holding two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Other charter amendments generally require approval of the
Board and the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. As permitted under the Maryland General Corporation Law, Host’s bylaws provide that directors have the exclusive right to amend Host’s bylaws.
These provisions may make it more difficult to amend Host’s charter and bylaws to alter the provisions described herein that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of Host common stock, without the
approval of the Board of Directors.

Shares of Host’s common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share
price.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of Host’s common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could adversely
affect prevailing market prices for Host’s common stock. In addition, holders of units of limited partnership interest of Host LP, whose OP units may be redeemed, at Host’s election, in exchange for common stock, will be able to sell those
shares freely, unless the person is our affiliate and resale of the affiliate’s shares is not covered by an effective registration statement. Further, a substantial number of shares of Host’s common stock have been and will be issued or
reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans, including shares of common stock reserved for options, or pursuant to securities we may issue that are convertible into shares of Host common stock or securities (other than
OP units) that Host LP has issued that are exchangeable for shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2008, there are approximately 15.1 million OP units outstanding that are redeemable and $400 million principal amount of
exchangeable senior debentures of Host LP issued in 2004 that could become exchangeable under certain conditions for approximately 25 million shares of Host common stock (subject to adjustment for various reasons, including as a result of the
payment of


dividends to common stockholders). In 2007, we also issued an additional $600 million principal amount of exchangeable debentures, the principal portion
of which is cash-settled, therefore, no shares would be issued unless our share price exceeded the exchange rate of the 2007 Debentures of $31.90 as of December 31, 2008. Moreover, additional shares of common stock issued by Host would be
available in the future for sale in the public markets. We can make no prediction about the effect that future sales of common stock would have on the market price of Host common stock.

Our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of Host’s common stock.

We believe that the market value of a REIT’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the REIT’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, whether from operations,
sales, acquisitions, development or refinancings, and is secondarily based upon the value of the underlying assets. For that reason, shares of Host’s common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share.
To the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may
negatively impact the market price of Host’s common stock. Our failure to meet the market’s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of Host’s common stock.

Market interest rates may affect the price of shares of Host’s common stock.

We believe that one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a REIT is the dividend rate on the
shares, considered as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of REIT shares may expect a higher dividend rate. Thus, higher market interest rates could
cause the market price of Host’s shares to decrease.

Federal Income Tax Risks

To qualify as a REIT, each of Host and its subsidiary REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, regardless of available cash or outstanding obligations.

To continue to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders with respect to each year at least 90% of our taxable
income, excluding net capital gain. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income and net capital gain for the taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state corporate income
tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain. In addition, we will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions made by us with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of
our ordinary income and 95% of our net capital gain for that year and any undistributed taxable income from prior years less excess distributions from prior years. We intend to make distributions, subject to the availability of cash and in
compliance with any debt covenants, to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid the imposition of a significant nondeductible 4% excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from Host LP and its
subsidiaries. We may incur a nominal nondeductible 4% excise tax for 2008, depending on the amount of our final 2008 taxable income. There are differences in timing between our recognition of taxable income and our receipt of cash available for
distribution due to, among other things, the seasonality of the lodging industry and the fact that some taxable income will be “phantom” income, which is taxable income that is not matched by cash flow. Due to transactions entered into in
years prior to Host’s conversion to a REIT, Host could recognize substantial amounts of “phantom” income. It is possible that these differences between taxable income and the receipt of related cash could require us to borrow funds or
to issue additional equity to enable Host to meet the distribution requirement and, therefore, to maintain our REIT status, and to avoid the nondeductible 4% excise tax. In addition, because the REIT distribution requirement prevents Host from
retaining earnings, we will generally be required to refinance debt at its maturity with additional debt or equity. It is possible that any of these sources of funds, if available at all, would not be sufficient to meet Host’s distribution and
tax obligations.


As a result of an acquisition in 2006, Host owns, through Host LP, 100% of the outstanding common stock
(and a portion of the outstanding preferred stock) of two entities that have elected to be treated as REITs. Each of these subsidiary REITs of Host will be subject to the same requirements that Host must satisfy in order to qualify as a REIT,
including the distribution requirements described above.

Adverse tax consequences would apply if Host or any of its subsidiary REITs fail to qualify as
a REIT.

We believe that Host has been organized and has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a REIT under the Code, commencing
with our taxable year beginning January 1, 1999, and Host currently intends to continue to operate as a REIT during future years. In addition, Host owns, through Host LP, two entities as of December 31, 2008, that have elected to be
treated as REITs. As the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a REIT are limited, no assurance can be provided that
Host currently qualifies as a REIT or will continue to qualify as a REIT or that each of Host’s subsidiary REITs qualify as a REIT. If any of the subsidiary REITs were to fail to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that Host would fail to qualify
as a REIT unless we (or the subsidiary REIT) could avail ourselves (itself) of certain relief provisions. New legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect
to an entity’s qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of its REIT qualification. If Host or any of the subsidiary REITs were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and any available relief provisions did not apply, the
non-qualifying REIT would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax,
on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. Moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying REIT would not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification was lost.

Any determination that Host or one of our subsidiary REITs does not qualify as a REIT would have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and could reduce the value of our common stock materially. The additional tax liability of Host or the subsidiary REIT for the year, or years, in which the relevant entity did not qualify as a REIT would reduce its net earnings available
for investment, debt service or distributions to stockholders. Furthermore, the non-qualifying entity would no longer be required to make any distributions to stockholders as a condition to REIT qualification and all of its distributions to
stockholders would be taxable as ordinary C corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that if Host were to fail to qualify as a REIT, Host’s stockholders currently taxed as individuals
would be taxed on those dividends at capital gain rates and our corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject in each case, to applicable limitations under the Code.
Host’s failure to qualify as a REIT also would cause an event of default under Host LP’s credit facility that could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due under the credit facility, which, in turn, would constitute an event of default
under Host LP’s outstanding debt securities.

If our leases are not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes, each of Host and its
subsidiary REITs would fail to qualify as a REIT.

To qualify as a REIT, Host must satisfy two gross income tests, pursuant to which
specified percentages of our gross income must be passive income, such as rent. For the rent paid pursuant to the hotel leases with our TRS subsidiaries, which currently constitutes substantially all of Host’s and each of our subsidiary
REITs’ gross income, to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement.
We believe that the leases will be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will agree with this characterization. If the leases were not respected as true leases for federal income
tax purposes, neither Host nor any of our subsidiary REITs would be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs and each would likely lose its REIT status.


If our affiliated lessees fail to qualify as taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of Host and its subsidiary REITs would
fail to qualify as a REIT.

Rent paid by a lessee that is a “related party tenant” of Host will not be qualifying income for
purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs. We lease substantially all of our hotels to our subsidiary that is taxable as a regular C corporation and that has elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary with respect to Host.
So long as any affiliated lessee qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary, it will not be treated as a “related party tenant.” We believe that our affiliated lessees have qualified and will continue to qualify, and that the taxable REIT
subsidiaries of our subsidiary REITs have qualified and will continue to qualify, to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will not challenge the status of a taxable
REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in disqualifying any of our affiliated lessees (including the taxable REIT subsidiaries of our subsidiary REITs) from
treatment as a taxable REIT subsidiary, it is possible that Host or a subsidiary REIT would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to REITs and substantially all of its income would fail to qualify for the gross income tests. If Host or a
subsidiary REIT failed to meet either the asset or gross income tests, each would likely lose its REIT status.

Despite the REIT status of each of Host
and its subsidiary REITs, we remain subject to various taxes.

One of Host’s subsidiary REITs will be required to pay federal
income tax at the highest regular corporate rate on “built-in gain” recognized as a result of any sale of a hotel asset before the expiration of the applicable 10-year holding period of assets, including certain hotels acquired from
Starwood and its affiliates in 2006. The total amount of gain on which the subsidiary REIT would be subject to corporate income tax if all of its built-in gain assets were sold in a taxable transaction prior to the expiration of the applicable
10-year holding period would be material to it. In addition, we expect that we could recognize other substantial deferred tax liabilities in the future without any corresponding receipt of cash.

Notwithstanding their status as a REIT, Host and our subsidiaries (including our subsidiary REITs) will be subject to some federal, state, local and
foreign taxes on their income and property. For example, Host and our subsidiary REITs will pay tax on certain types of income that is not distributed and will be subject to a 100% excise tax on transactions with a taxable REIT subsidiary that are
not conducted on an arm’s length basis. Moreover, the taxable REIT subsidiaries of Host and our subsidiary REITs are taxable as regular C corporations and will pay federal, state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable
corporate rates, and foreign taxes to the extent they own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions.

Host LP is obligated
under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes (and any related interest and penalties) incurred by Host.

If the IRS were to challenge
successfully Host LP’s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, Host would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.

We believe that Host LP qualifies to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, it is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including Host,
is required to pay tax on such partner’s allocable share of its income. No assurance can be provided, however, that the IRS will not challenge Host LP’s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not
sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating Host LP as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, Host would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, cease to
qualify as a REIT. If Host LP fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or Host fails to qualify as a REIT, either failure would cause an event of default under Host LP’s credit facility that, in turn, could constitute
an event of default under Host LP’s outstanding debt securities. Also, the failure of Host LP to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes would cause it to become subject to federal, state and foreign corporate income tax, which
would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including Host.


As a REIT, each of Host and its subsidiary REITs is subject to limitations on its ownership of debt and equity
securities.

Subject to certain exceptions, a REIT is generally prohibited from owning securities in any one issuer to the extent that
(1) the value of those securities exceeds 5% of the value of the REIT’s total assets, (2) the securities owned by the REIT represent more than 10% of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities, or (3) the REIT owns more than
10% of the value of the issuer’s outstanding securities. A REIT is permitted to own securities of a subsidiary in an amount that exceeds the 5% value test and the 10% vote or value test if the subsidiary elects to be a taxable REIT subsidiary.
However, a REIT may not own securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 20% (25% for tax years beginning after July 30, 2008) of the value of the REIT’s total assets. If Host or any of its subsidiary
REITs were to violate these ownership limitations, each would likely lose its REIT status.

Each of Host or its subsidiary REITs may be required to pay
a penalty tax upon the sale of a hotel.

The federal income tax provisions applicable to REITs provide that any gain realized by a REIT
on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a “prohibited transaction” that is subject to a 100% excise tax. Under existing
law, whether property, including hotels, is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular
transaction. We intend to hold our hotels for investment with a view to long-term appreciation, to engage in the business of acquiring and owning hotels and to make occasional sales of hotels consistent with our investment objectives. There can be
no assurance, however, that the IRS might not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the 100% excise tax.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved in various legal
proceedings in the normal course of business. On April 27, 2005, we initiated suit against Keystone-Texas Property Holding Corporation (“Keystone”) in the 73rd Judicial District Court of Bexar County, Texas, Case No. 05-CI-14229, seeking a
declaration that a provision of our ground lease for the property under the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter Hotel was valid and claiming that Keystone had breached that lease provision. On April 6, 2006, a Bexar County Court granted an
interlocutory motion for summary judgment that the provision was not valid and the lease provision had not been breached. Thereafter, on October 18, 2006, Keystone filed an amended counterclaim and later, a third party claim, alleging that we
tortiously interfered with Keystone’s attempted sale of the property and that we slandered Keystone’s title to the property. We believe that our actions were entirely lawful.

We are vigorously defending this claim and all other claims; however, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. We
believe that the final resolution of any of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol “HST.” The following table sets forth, for the fiscal
periods indicated, the high and low closing sales prices per share of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and dividends declared per share:

Under the terms of our senior notes indenture and the credit facility, our ability to pay
dividends and make other payments is dependent on our ability to satisfy certain financial requirements. See “Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Financial Condition” and “Risk
Factors—Financial Risks and Risks of Operation—Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness or preferred stock.”

As of February 23, 2009, there were 34,904 holders of record of our common stock. However, because many of the shares of our common stock are held
by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we believe that there are considerably more beneficial holders of our common stock than record holders. As of February 23, 2009, there were 2,024 holders of OP units (in addition to
Host). OP units are redeemable for cash, or, at our election, convertible into Host common stock.

Our ability to qualify as a REIT under
the Internal Revenue Code is facilitated by limiting the number of shares of our stock that a person may own. Our charter provides that, subject to limited exceptions, no person or persons acting as a group may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of
the attribution provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, more than 9.8% in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive, of shares of Host’s outstanding common stock, preferred stock or any other stock, each considered as a separate class
or series for this purpose. The Board of Directors has the authority to increase the ownership limit from time to time, but does not have the authority to do so to the extent that after giving effect to such increase, any five beneficial owners of
capital stock could beneficially own in the aggregate more than 49.5% of the outstanding capital stock. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Ownership of Host’s Common Stock—There are limitations on the acquisition of Host common
stock and changes in control.”

†

On February 20, 2008, Host announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of common stock and equity related securities in open
market transactions or through private transactions. The plan does not obligate Host to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time. There is no expiration date for the program. Common shares in the aggregate amount of
$100 million were repurchased during the first three quarters of 2008 and no common shares were repurchased as part of this program during the fourth quarter. However, Host LP did repurchase $100 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.25%
exchangeable senior debentures during the period which, under the terms of the Board authorization, reduced the amount eligible for common share repurchases by Host by the approximate $82 million in cash paid for the debentures. As a result of these
purchases, we currently have approximately $318 million left under the Board of Directors’ authorization for future repurchases.

Fourth Quarter Sales of Unregistered Securities

At various times during the fourth quarter, we issued shares of our common
stock upon exchanges of OP units of Host LP by the holders thereof. In each case, one share of Host common stock was issued in exchange for one OP unit of Host LP. All of the shares were issued pursuant to the private placement exemption from
registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. Set forth below are the dates of issuance, the entity receiving the shares and the amount of shares received.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.

Overview

As of February 23,
2009, we own 116 luxury and upper-upscale hotel properties and we are the largest lodging REIT in the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s composite index. A REIT is a legal entity that owns real estate assets and, through
payments of dividends to stockholders, is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level. Host operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT and owns approximately 97% of the partnership interests of Host
Hotels & Resorts, L.P., or Host LP.

Our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely
recognized in the lodging industry. The majority of our properties are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors. In
2008, approximately 75% of our revenues were generated by our urban and resort/conference hotels. The classification of a property as luxury or upper-upscale is based on lodging industry standards, which take into consideration many factors such as
guest facilities and amenities, level of service and quality of accommodations. While our hotels are still subject to competitive pressures, we believe this strategy will allow us to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums over our competitors. We
seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management by assisting the managers of our hotels in optimizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements.

Our Customers

The majority of
our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business, and contract business, which accounted for approximately 54%, 41% and 5%, respectively, of our 2008 room sales. Similar to the majority of the lodging industry, we
further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows:

Transient business broadly
represents individual business or leisure travelers. Business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels, with leisure travelers making up the remainder. Therefore, we will be more significantly affected by trends in business
travel versus leisure demand. The four key subcategories of the transient business group are:

•

Premium: Sometimes referred to as “rack rate,” typically consists of rooms booked close to arrival during high demand periods and is the highest rate
category available. Room rates will fluctuate depending on anticipated demand levels (e.g. seasonality, weekday vs. weekend stays).

•

Corporate: This is the benchmark rate which a hotel publishes and offers to the general public. It is typically the second highest category, and is for travelers
that do not have access to negotiated or discount rates.

•

Special Corporate: This is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel
brands generally. These rates are typically negotiated annually, at a discount to the anticipated corporate rate.

•

Discount: This encompasses all discount programs, such as AAA and AARP discounts, government per diem, rooms booked through wholesale channels, frequent guest
program redemptions, and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel.


Group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together, usually with a minimum of 10 rooms.
Examples include a company training session or a social event such as a family reunion. The three key sub-categories of the group business category are:

•

Association: group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions.

•

Corporate: group business related to corporate meetings (e.g., product launches, training programs, contract negotiations, and presentations).

•

Other: group business predominately related to social, military, education, religious, fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams, otherwise known as SMERF
business.

The final category is contract demand, which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an
extended period of time at significantly discounted rates. Contract rates are usually utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand. Airline crews are typical generators of contract demand
for our hotels.

Understanding Our Performance

Our Revenues and Expenses

Our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements
under which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay
wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each four-week or monthly accounting period, depending on the manager, which reflects hotel-level sales less
property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation).

Hotel revenue is approximately 98% of our total revenue. The following table
presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue:


Hotel operating expenses are approximately 99% of our total operating costs and expenses. The following
table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses:

The expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of
operations. It is also worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items, however, taken separately these costs represent approximately 54% of our hotel operating expenses.

Key Performance Indicators

Revenue
per available room, or RevPAR, is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not
include food and beverage or parking, telephone or other guest service revenues generated by the property. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels.

RevPAR changes that are driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental
operating profit than do changes that are driven predominately by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage, as well as additional
incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, would not result in additional room-related costs. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by increases or
decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels.


In discussing our operating results, we present RevPAR and certain other financial data for our hotels on
a comparable hotel basis. Comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared. Comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold, or that incurred business
interruption due to significant property damage, large scale capital improvements or significant events during these periods.

We also
evaluate the performance of our business through non-GAAP financial measures, including funds from operations (“FFO”) per diluted share and comparable hotel adjusted operating profit. We use FFO per diluted share as a supplemental measure
of company-wide profitability. Another key profitability indicator we use is hotel adjusted operating profit, which is a non-GAAP measure used to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels. Hotel adjusted operating profit measures
property-level results before debt service and is a supplemental measure of individual property-level profitability. The comparable hotel adjusted operating profit that we discuss is an aggregation of the adjusted operating profit for each of our
comparable hotels. Each of the non-GAAP measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit and earnings per share. We provide a more detailed discussion of these
non-GAAP financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance as well as certain limitations of such measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

Summary of 2008 Operating Results

During 2008, we were significantly affected by the economic recession in the U.S. and the collapse of the credit markets, which contributed to a
significant decrease in business and consumer spending. These factors combined to depress overall lodging demand for both the Company and the lodging industry throughout 2008, which resulted in a year long decline in occupancy levels and, starting
in the fourth quarter, a decline in average room rates. The Company began to experience a decline in comparable RevPAR in the third quarter before decreasing sharply in the fourth quarter. Overall comparable RevPAR decreased 2.6% in 2008 as a result
of a decrease in occupancy of 2.4 percentage points, which was partially offset by a .7% in increase in average room rate. Additionally, food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels decreased 2.9% during 2008. Total revenue decreased
$123 million, or 2.3%, to $5.3 billion for the year, primarily due to the decline in RevPAR and food and beverage revenues.

As a
result, we have experienced a steady weakening in operating results and a decrease in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit each quarter, though most significantly in the fourth quarter. Net income from continuing operations decreased
$144 million in 2008 to $402 million. Net income decreased $300 million to $427 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in operations at our hotels and a decrease in gains on dispositions from
$164 million in 2007 compared to $23 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations decreased $.29 to $.71 in 2008, while diluted earnings per share decreased $.57 to $.76 in 2008. FFO per diluted share
decreased $.17, to $1.74, for 2008. FFO per diluted share was reduced by $.08 for 2007 due to costs associated with debt repayments or refinancings. There were no such costs incurred in 2008.

We worked to mitigate the decline in revenues and operating income by directing our operators to implement significant contingency plans early in the
year to help contain margin deterioration. These cost-cutting measures included right-sizing the work force to the amount of business being generated, not filling vacant positions, reducing discretionary spending, delaying the implementation of
brand standards, closing restaurant outlets or modifying hours of operations, as well as closing specific floors or towers to reflect the decrease in occupancy. While these efforts have been successful in reducing operating costs, other expenses
such as wages and benefits, real estate taxes and utilities increased at above inflationary rates in 2008. In addition to our cost-cutting measures, our managers accessed additional revenue channels, particularly e-commerce channels, in an effort to
offset the decline in revenues from more traditional sources.


Investing Activities

Acquisitions/Dispositions

Domestically, we did not complete any acquisitions during 2008. During the first half of 2008, as lodging fundamentals weakened, the luxury and upper-upscale hotels that were marketed did not meet our investment criteria. During the second
half of 2008, the economic recession deepened and the ability to obtain financing for acquisitions became extremely limited and only at much lower leverage ratios and at significantly higher interest rates. Consequently, very few hotels were
marketed or sold. Management believes that there may be an increase in the number of assets available for purchase late in 2009 and in 2010 as a result of the current recessionary environment and illiquid credit market.

Our European joint venture in which we hold a 32.1% interest, was able to successfully complete the purchase of the 270-room Crowne Plaza Amsterdam City
Centre for approximately €72 million (U.S. $113 million) in April 2008.

On February 17, 2009, we disposed of the Hyatt
Regency Boston for net proceeds of approximately $113 million, including the return of reserves held by the manager. We anticipate that we will recognize a gain on the disposition of approximately $20 million, net of tax, in 2009. During
2008, we disposed of the Sheraton Tampa Suites Airport Hotel and the Host Airport Hotel Sacramento. Proceeds from these dispositions were approximately $39 million and we recorded a gain of $23 million, net of tax, in 2008.

Capital Expenditures

We recently
completed a three-year $1.8 billion capital expenditure program, which we believe significantly enhances the competitiveness of our properties. This program consisted of renewal and replacement, ROI/repositioning and value enhancement projects
in a broad array of areas including lobbies and public spaces, food and beverage facilities, spas, retail outlets, meeting space and rooms as well as energy conservation and other non-public areas of the properties. We spent approximately $695
million on capital expenditures in 2008, including $321 million on ROI/repositioning projects and value enhancement projects at 17 properties. These amounts include the application of a $23 million deposit made in 2007. These projects included:

•

the completion of a 105,000 square foot exhibit hall at the Orlando World Center Marriott in 2007;

•

the construction of new food and beverage facilities, renovation of all existing break-out space and the construction of the new 26,000 square foot Atrium Ballroom
at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis in 2007 and 2008; and

•

the construction of an 8,300 square foot meeting space addition and the renovation of over 60,000 square feet of public space and food and beverage facilities at
the San Francisco Marriott in 2008.

Additionally, our renewal and replacement capital expenditures totaled
$374 million during 2008 and included the renovation of over 11,900 rooms and over 465,000 square feet of meeting space. As a result of these efforts and in an effort to improve future liquidity, we anticipate reducing total capital
expenditures to approximately $340 million to $360 million in 2009, which represents approximately one-half of the 2008 level. A significant portion of our spending in 2009 will be dedicated to projects that are already in process.
Additionally, we may reduce the level of expenditures further if the economic recession is longer or deeper than currently anticipated.

Financing Activities

The volatility and disruption in the credit markets in the latter half of 2008 was dramatic and has
resulted in significantly higher interest rates for all types of financing, as well as greatly reduced availability for many of the traditional forms of financing such as collateralized mortgage backed securities and other secured debt


financings. As noted above, this not only affected the ability to acquire or dispose of assets, but also to refinance existing debt. For example, during the
fourth quarter of 2008, yields on BB rated senior notes peaked at approximately 15%, or approximately 1350 basis points over treasury rates. This is compared to yields of approximately 8.5% and spreads of approximately 450 basis points in the fourth
quarter of 2007. While spreads tightened by 250 to 350 basis points since mid-December 2008, they are still well above the historical average. Due to this uncertainty in the financial markets, we increased our available cash position by drawing $200
million on the revolving portion of the credit facility in September 2008. As a result of prior year efforts to establish a capital structure with the appropriate mixture of debt and equity and balanced maturities, we ended 2008 with strong interest
coverage and leverage ratios under our credit facility and senior notes covenants (See “Financial Condition”). Currently, our debt maturities in 2009 are approximately $321 million, including $11 million of principal amortization,
which we have the ability to either refinance or repay. Subsequent to the closing of the sale of the Hyatt Regency Boston on February 17, 2009, we have over $600 million of cash and cash equivalents and $400 million of capacity under our credit
facility revolver.

2009 Outlook

We believe the recessionary economic environment expected for 2009, specifically declining GDP, employment, business investment, corporate profits and consumer spending, will negatively impact the demand for lodging
in both the business and leisure components of our business. When looking at historical relationships, the current 2009 consensus estimates for the key economic drivers would suggest an overall decrease in industry lodging demand ranging from 3% to
5%. We believe that lodging demand will decline in 2009 and, in particular, we expect lodging demand in the luxury segment will continue to underperform other segments as consumers trade down to less expensive alternatives. We do not anticipate an
improvement in lodging demand until the current economic trends reverse course, particularly the expected continued weakness in the overall economy and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. While new supply in 2009 is expected to be
moderately above historical average, we expect that as a result of the current fiscal environment increases in lodging supply over the next few years will likely slow significantly. This may be particularly relevant for the markets and lodging
sectors in which we compete due to the long-term planning and high level of investment associated with these properties.

We believe that
the economic slowdown will significantly affect both the group and transient elements of our business. We believe group demand will continue to decline as companies reduce travel expenditures, which will lead to increased cancellations, diminished
booking activity and reduced attendance. Similarly, the reduction in corporate travel budgets will affect the transient business traveler. The consumer-led elements of this economic slowdown will also result in a disproportionate impact to
leisure-dependent destinations, such as Hawaii and Florida, as domestic and international households are likely to reduce discretionary spending.

In 2008, we declared a total dividend of $.65 per share. We intend to suspend our regular quarterly dividend in 2009 and instead we expect to declare a $.30 to $.35 per share common dividend in the fourth quarter, which may be paid either
in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The amount of any dividend will be determined by Host’s Board of Directors. We intend to continue paying dividends on our preferred stock.

The general economic trends discussed above make it a difficult environment to predict operating results for our hotels for 2009. Therefore, there can be
no assurances that we will not experience further declines in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, greater than anticipated weakness in the economy and changes in travel patterns.

Hotel Sales Overview

2008 Compared to 2007

Hotel sales declined in 2008 due to decreases in occupancy at our properties, as well as decreases in food and beverage and other revenue items. Sales for
properties disposed of in both years have been reclassified as discontinued operations. See “Discontinued Operations” below.

Comparable hotel RevPAR decreased 2.6%. The decrease in RevPAR was the result of a 2.4 percentage point decrease in occupancy which was slightly offset by a .7% increase in average room rates. Occupancy was negatively affected by the
decrease in overall lodging demand.


Food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels decreased 2.9%, primarily due to decreased sales
from our catering and banquet business and meeting room rentals and the decline in occupancy at our hotels. Other revenues for our comparable hotels, which primarily represent spa, golf, parking, internet connectivity and other fees, were down
slightly.

While management evaluates the performance of each individual hotel against its competitive set in a given market, overall we
evaluate the portfolio operating results using three different criteria: property type (i.e. urban, suburban, resort/conference or airport), geographic region and mix of business (i.e. transient, group or contract).

Comparable Hotel Sales by Property Type

The following tables set forth performance information for 2008 and 2007:

Comparable Hotels Portfolio by Property Type(a)

(a)

The reporting period for 2008 is from December 29, 2007 to December 26, 2008 and for 2007 is from December 30, 2006 to December 28, 2007 for our Marriott hotels.
For further discussion, see “Reporting Periods”.

For 2008, RevPAR decreased across all of our hotel property
types. RevPAR at our resort/conference properties have been particularly affected by the current economic recession due to reduced consumer spending and increased travel costs. In particular, our Hawaiian properties have seen a dramatic decline in
RevPAR as a result of decreased airlift to the Hawaiian islands and overall weak demand in this market. RevPAR at our urban, airport and suburban hotels also declined due to the overall decline in lodging demand.


Comparable Hotel Sales by Geographic Region

The following tables set forth performance information for 2008 and 2007:

Comparable Hotels by Region(a)

(a)

The reporting period for 2008 is from December 29, 2007 to December 26, 2008 and for 2007 is from December 30, 2006 to December 28, 2007 for our Marriott hotels.
For further discussion, see “Reporting Periods”.

In terms of RevPAR growth, our International region was the top
performing region due to RevPAR growth at our Chilean and Canadian hotels and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Comparable hotel RevPAR growth in our Florida region was driven by RevPAR growth at the Harbor Beach Marriott
where we benefited from prior year disruption caused by rooms renovations and the Orlando World Center Marriott where significant discounting drove transient demand. RevPAR results were partially offset by rooms’ renovations at three hotels in
the region, as well as the impact of Hurricane Fay. RevPAR growth in the South Central region was the result of year-over-year growth in our Houston market which had a strong fourth quarter due to Hurricane Ike induced demand as well as our San
Antonio properties, which experienced strong group business because of recent renovations in the fourth quarter of 2007.

The RevPAR
decline in our Pacific region was driven by the 17.1% RevPAR decline at our Hawaiian properties and a 3.8% decline at our San Diego properties. The region’s best performer based on RevPAR growth was the San Francisco market which had a 1.9%
increase in RevPAR, however, the RevPAR growth was concentrated in the first half of the year, as RevPAR in San Francisco declined significantly in the fourth quarter. RevPAR in our New England region also declined, reflecting decreased demand at
our Boston hotels due to fewer city-wide events and softening leisure demand. In addition, we experienced higher group attrition and cancellations than in prior periods.

The North Central region underperformed other regions, as results in Chicago were particularly weak due primarily to renovations at three of our Chicago properties and lower transient demand. The Atlanta region also
underperformed in comparison to the overall portfolio due to weak group bookings, lower transient demand and increased supply. RevPAR in our Mountain region also declined as the Phoenix market continued to struggle due to lower group and transient
demand and rooms’ renovations at two hotels.

Hotel Sales by Business Mix

.    The majority of our customers
fall into three broad groups: transient, group and contract business. The information below is derived from business mix data for 108 of our hotels for which business mix data is available from our managers.


In 2008, overall transient average daily rates decreased 1.3% when compared to last year while our
overall group average room rate increased almost 3.9% over the prior year as most of the business was contracted prior to any significant downturn. We expect that booking pace will continue to slow as the weaker economy slows demand growth and, as a
result, we expect increased competition in terms of pricing will put added pressure on rates.

2007 Compared to 2006

Hotel sales growth for 2007 was due to increases in RevPAR, as well as increases in food and beverage and other revenue items. Hotel sales for 2007 also
reflect a full year of operations for the Starwood Portfolio and include $1,056 million and $755 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, from these properties. Sales for properties sold in both years have been reclassified as discontinued
operations. See “Discontinued Operations” below.

Comparable Hotel RevPAR increased 5.8% (as of December 31, 2007, 93 of our
119 hotels were classified as comparable hotels). The increase in RevPAR was the result of strong growth in average room rates and a slight increase in occupancy. The growth in average room rate was driven by increasing demand due to strong economic
growth in the first half of 2007 and low growth in the supply of new luxury and upper upscale hotels. As a result of these trends, our operators were able to continue to increase room rates, while marginally improving the year-over-year occupancy
levels. However, occupancy was affected at a number of our hotels by our capital expenditure program, which is described below, as well as weakness in individual markets.

Food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels increased 3.7%, primarily due to increased sales from our catering and banquet business and meeting room rentals. In addition, operating margins at our food and
beverage outlets increased 1.1 percentage points. Other revenues for our comparable hotels, which primarily represent spa, golf, parking, internet connectivity and other fees, increased 7.4%.

Comparable Hotel Sales by Property Type

The following table sets forth performance information for 2007 and 2006:

Comparable Hotels By Property Type(a)

(a)

The reporting period for 2007 for our Marriott hotels is from December 30, 2006 to December 28, 2007 and for 2006 is from December 31, 2005 to December 29, 2006.

For 2007, RevPAR increased across all of our hotel property types, led by our urban hotels, as we benefited from strong
performance in several downtown markets such as Boston, New York, and San Francisco. We also experienced RevPAR growth at our suburban hotels due to strong performances at our suburban Boston, Denver and Los Angeles hotels. RevPAR growth at our
airport hotels was led by our San Francisco and Houston airport hotels. RevPAR growth for our resort/convention hotels was moderate as several hotels were significantly affected by major renovations.


Comparable Hotel Sales by Geographic Region

The following table sets forth performance information for 2007 and 2006:

Comparable Hotels By Region(a)

(a)

The reporting period for 2007 for our Marriott hotels is from December 30, 2006 to December 28, 2007 and for 2006 is from December 31, 2005 to December 29, 2006.

For 2007, our Mid-Atlantic region was the top performing region due to exceptional RevPAR growth by our New York City hotels
driven by strong business and leisure transient demand and average room rate increases. The New England region also performed well due to increased city-wide events in the Boston market, particularly during the second half of the year, as this
market was affected by lower levels of group and transient demand during the first half of the year.

Increases in RevPAR for our Pacific,
DC Metro and Mountain regions were generally consistent with the levels for the overall portfolio. Increases in RevPAR in our Pacific region were driven by the Los Angeles and San Francisco markets. The Los Angeles market grew due to increased
average room rates for transient business along with a strong group base. The San Francisco market had a strong year driven by city-wide events. The growth in the DC Metro region was driven by the performance of our downtown hotels, which was
partially offset by weak performance by our suburban properties in the region.

RevPAR growth during the year in the Florida region was
moderate, as group activity was slow due to hurricane concerns and renovation displacement at several hotels including the Harbor Beach Marriott Resort and Spa and the Tampa Marriott Waterside Hotel and Marina. The weak RevPAR growth in the Atlanta
region was due to lower levels of occupancy, as city-wide demand decreased from the unusually strong performance in 2006 that reflected business relocation from New Orleans due to Hurricane Katrina. However, in the fourth quarter, the Atlanta region
experienced RevPAR increases due to strong group bookings in the mid-town area. The North Central region under-performed the portfolio primarily due to weakness in the Chicago market.

Hotel Sales by Business Mix

.    In 2007, relatively strong demand levels allowed our operators to increase average daily room
rates, particularly in the corporate transient segments. Overall transient average daily rates increased 7% when compared to last year and our overall group average room rate for these hotels increased almost 5%.


2008 compared to 2007 and 2007 compared to 2006

Property-level Operating Expenses

Property-level operating expenses increased each year from 2006 through 2008 due to several
factors. In 2008, the 1% increase was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense due to our extensive $1.8 billion capital expenditure program from 2006 to 2008. This was offset by a decline in revenue driven costs, primarily management
fees, reflecting our decline in operations during the second half of the year. By contrast, in 2007, all property-level costs increased, reflecting inflation, increases in revenue-driven costs and the effect of our capital expenditures on our
depreciation expense. Our operating costs and expenses, which are both fixed and variable, are affected by changes in occupancy, inflationary increases and revenues, though the effect on specific costs will differ. For example, utility costs include
a fixed component but will increase based on occupancy and with inflation, while depreciation expense is fixed except for the effects of property transactions (i.e. acquisitions, capital expenditures, dispositions, etc.). Similarly, management fees
are directly affected by total revenues, as well as the level of operating profit at each property. Additionally, 2008 and 2007 property-level operating expenses include the property-level expenses of the Starwood Portfolio for a full year of
approximately $844 million and $843 million, respectively. Comparatively, property-level operating expenses for 2006 include Starwood Portfolio expenses for the period from April 10, 2006 (the purchase date) through December 31, 2006 of
$593 million. Property-level operating expenses exclude the costs associated with hotels we have sold, which are included in discontinued operations.

Other Income Statement Line Items

Corporate and Other
Expense

s.    Corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and benefits including stock-based compensation expense, as well as other costs such as travel, corporate insurance, audit fees, building rent
and system costs. Corporate expenses decreased approximately $11 million in 2008 from 2007 and approximately $25 million in 2007 from 2006 due to the decrease in compensation expense recorded for our liability classified stock-based
compensation awards as the market performance criteria for the issuance of our restricted stock were not met and fewer shares were earned. Additionally, 2006 included non-recurring costs of approximately $7 million associated with the Starwood
acquisition.

Gain on Insurance Settlement.

We recorded a gain on insurance settlement of $7 million in
2008, $51 million in 2007 and $13 million in 2006. The gains primarily relate to the insurance proceeds received for both business interruption and property damage following Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma which occurred during September and
October 2005. The hurricanes caused substantial business interruption and property damage at our New Orleans Marriott and at five of our hotels located in southern Florida.

During 2008, the gain of $7 million primarily represents the release of contingencies related to an insurance settlement reached for business
interruption incurred at the New Orleans Marriott. During 2007, we recognized a gain of $30 million related to business interruption insurance proceeds received as a result of lost profit primarily at our New Orleans Marriott. Additionally, all
of the insurance gains of $13 million in 2006 represent business interruption insurance proceeds.


The remaining gain of $21 million in 2007 related to insurance proceeds for property damage
sustained by these properties. The gain represents the insurance proceeds received in excess of the insurance receivable recorded on the balance sheet at the date of loss. The insurance receivable reflected the book value of the property and
equipment written off and repairs and maintenance costs incurred from the hurricanes. We recognize the gains on insurance settlements once all contingencies are met, and, as a result, none of the property insurance proceeds were recognized in income
during 2005 or 2006.

Interest Income

.    The $17 million decline in interest income for 2008 when compared to
2007 is primarily due to lower interest rates during 2008, as well as a slightly lower weighted average cash balance for the full year 2008 compared to 2007. The increase of $4 million from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to an increase in the
weighted average cash balance in 2007.

Interest Expense.

The decrease of $81 million in interest expense for
2008 is primarily due to an expense of $45 million related to call premiums and the acceleration of the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with debt prepayments during 2007 compared to an $18 million gain in 2008 related to the
repurchase of $100 million principal amount of our 2004 Debentures. The decline in interest expense also reflects the decrease in our weighted average interest rate of 0.2 percentage points to 5.8%.

The decrease of $28 million in interest expense in 2007 is primarily due to a net decrease in debt of approximately $253 million and a decrease
in our weighted average interest rate of 0.8 percentage points to 6.0%. The decrease is partially offset by call premiums and the acceleration of the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with debt prepayments totaling $45 million
for 2007 compared to similar costs of $17 million for 2006.

Minority Interest Expense.

Minority
interest expense decreased $11 million in 2008 and $9 million in 2007 due to a decline in the net income of Host LP during both years. Host LP net income reflects the operations at our hotels and is significantly affected by the gain on
dispositions, which were $23 million, $164 million and $416 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Equity in Earnings (Losses)
of Affiliates.

In 2008, our share of income of affiliates decreased by $21 million compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in earnings from our joint venture in Europe and the write-off of costs associated with a
terminated transaction. However, in 2007, our share of income of affiliates increased by $17 million compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in earnings from our European joint venture, which was formed in April of 2006.

Discontinued Operations.

Discontinued operations consist of two hotels disposed of in 2008, nine hotels
disposed of during 2007 and seven hotels disposed of in 2006 and represent the results of operations and the gains on the disposition of these hotels during the periods. The following table summarizes the revenues, income before taxes, and the gain
on dispositions, net of tax, of the hotels which have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (in millions):

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

We seek to maintain a
capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry. During this period of


economic uncertainty, we have taken several steps to preserve capital and increase liquidity, including the third quarter draw of $200 million on our credit
facility, the reduction of our dividend beginning in the fourth quarter and the implementation of cost savings initiatives at both the corporate and hotel level which will include a reduction in 2009 in capital expenditures to approximately one-half
of the 2008 level. We believe, as a result of all of the above- mentioned efforts and the overall strength of our balance sheet, we have sufficient liquidity and access to capital markets to withstand the anticipated decline in operating cash flow
in 2009 and pay our debt maturities, fund our capital expenditure programs and maintain compliance with our debt financial covenants. We continue to maintain higher than historical cash levels due to uncertainty in the credit markets and we intend
to do so until the credit markets stabilize.

Cash Requirements.

We use cash for acquisitions, capital
expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, corporate and other expenses and dividends to stockholders. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gain) to our stockholders. Our sources of
cash are cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and our ability to obtain additional financing through various capital markets.

Set forth below is a schedule of our debt maturities through 2011. Our near term debt maturities in 2009 and 2010 are relatively low. While maturities in
2011 total $825 million, they include borrowings under the revolver portion of the credit facility, as well as the $210 million credit facility term loan and the Orlando Marriott World Center mortgage, all of which are subject to extension at our
option if certain requirements are met. See “—Financial Condition” for more information on our debt maturities.

Debt
Maturities 2009 – 2011

(in millions)

(1)

We provided notice to the lender of the approximately $34 million mortgage on the Westin Indianapolis that we will prepay the debt in March 2009.

(2)

Our 3.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures are due in 2024 but are subject to a put option by the holders in 2010.

(3)

This mortgage is subject to two, one-year extension options provided that debt coverage exceeds certain ratios and other conditions are met.

(4)

Our credit facility may be extended for one year provided that our leverage ratio is below 6.75x. See “—Financial Condition” for further discussion.

As of December 31, 2008, we had $508 million of cash and cash equivalents, which was an increase of
$20 million from December 31, 2007. In the first quarter of 2009, we paid the fourth quarter common and preferred dividends of $29 million and received $113 million net proceeds from the sale of the Hyatt Regency Boston,
including the return of reserves held by the manager. We also have $400 million available under our credit facility. During 2009, our primary uses of cash will be debt maturities, capital expenditures at our hotels and REIT distribution
requirements. Additionally, we may take advantage of the ability to satisfy up to 90% of our dividend requirements through the issuance of common stock dividends in order to conserve cash.


Capital Resources.

We depend primarily on external sources of capital to
finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Therefore, our financial
flexibility (including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants, which include, among others, the allowable amounts of leverage, coverage and
fixed charges. Since 2003, we have improved our financial covenant ratios through a number of transactions that have extended our weighted average maturity and reduced interest costs. As a result of these efforts, our weighted average interest rate
has declined significantly, from 7.7% at December 31, 2003 to 5.8% at December 31, 2008 and our weighted average maturities have remained consistent at approximately five years. Additionally, since December 31, 2006, we have reduced
our secured mortgage indebtedness by approximately 29% to $1.4 billion, which represents approximately 24% of our overall indebtedness and is secured by 14 of our hotels. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 80% of our hotels (as measured by
revenues) are unencumbered by mortgage debt. Given the flexibility provided by the structure of our balance sheet, we will look to access both the market for our senior notes and the secured mortgage debt markets, based on relative pricing and
capacity, to fund our cash requirements. We may, at any time, seek to access such markets in the event that we determine that the terms and conditions available to us are advantageous based upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity
requirements, contractual restrictions and other circumstances. See “Financial Condition” for further discussion of our restrictive covenants.

Debt transactions.

During 2008, we entered into a $210 million term loan and borrowed $200 million of our available $600 million capacity under the revolver portion of our credit
facility. We also refinanced our $208 million mortgage loan on the Orlando World Center Marriott through the issuance of a $300 million floating rate mortgage loan. In addition, we repurchased $100 million principal amount of our 3.25% Exchangeable
Senior Debentures for approximately $82 million, for a gain of approximately $18 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2008, our debt has an average maturity of 4.6 years and a weighted average interest rate of 5.8%.

In addition to the above financing activities, we paid approximately $16 million of principal amortization of mortgage debt in 2008 and repaid the
$33.5 million mortgage secured by our Scottsdale Marriott at McDowell Mountains, which matured in December 2008.

We may continue to redeem
or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions when available. We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or,
in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any refinancing
or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and Funds From Operations, or FFO per diluted share, as defined below, as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing
costs. Specifically, interest expense includes $45 million for 2007 for call premiums, the acceleration of deferred financing costs and original issue discount and the termination of related interest rate swap agreements associated with debt
prepayments.

Counterparty Credit Risk.

We are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the
ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. As a result of the recent bankruptcy and insolvency of
several high-profile, well-respected financial institutions, we have performed additional assessments to determine the impact, if any, of these market developments on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held
at various financial institutions, access to our credit facility, the amounts due and services performed by our managers and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts. Currently, our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited. Our
exposure with regard to our cash and the $400 million available under our credit facility is mitigated as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions. Amounts due from the managers of our hotels
generally reflect the operations of the hotel in the immediately preceding period and the working capital at the hotels. These amounts


totaled $65 million as of December 31, 2008 and we consider the risk that our managers will fail to meet the payment obligations to be remote.
Currently, our exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totals $6 million and the counterparties are investment grade financial institutions.

Equity Transactions

.    On February 19, 2008, Host’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of common stock and equity-related securities. The
securities may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions, depending upon market conditions. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As of
December 31, 2008, the Company has repurchased 6.5 million common shares valued at approximately $100 million and repurchased $100 million principal amount of our 3.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures for approximately $82 million. As a
result of these purchases, we currently have approximately $318 million left under the Board’s authorization for future repurchases.

Non-cash Investing and Financing Activities.

On March 12, 2008, we acquired the remaining limited partnership interests in Pacific Gateway Ltd., a subsidiary partnership of Host LP, which owns the San Diego Marriott Hotel
and Marina, and other economic rights formerly held by our outside partner, including the right to receive 1.7% of the hotel’s sales, in exchange for 5,575,540 limited partnership units of Host LP. The OP units were valued at $93 million based
on the closing stock price on such date for Host, or $16.68.

Acquisitions and Dispositions.

On
February 17, 2009, we disposed of the Hyatt Regency Boston for net proceeds of approximately $113 million, including the return of reserves held by the manager. We anticipate that we will recognize a gain on the disposition of
approximately $20 million, net of tax, in 2009. During 2008, we disposed of two domestic properties for total proceeds of approximately $39 million and recorded a gain of approximately $23 million, net of tax.

In April 2008, the European joint venture acquired the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam City Centre for approximately €72 million (US $113 million),
including our investment of €3 million (US $5 million) and the issuance of approximately €53.3 million of mortgage debt.

We may acquire additional properties through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs or similar
real estate entities. We anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods, including proceeds from sales of properties from our existing portfolio, the incurrence of debt, available cash, advances under our credit
facility, proceeds from equity offerings of Host, or issuance of OP units by Host LP.

Capital
Expenditures.

During 2008, we continued our extensive capital expenditure program, which included the renovation of approximately 11,900 rooms and approximately 465,000 square feet of meeting space. In 2008, our capital
expenditures totaled $695 million, including the application of $23 million of deposits made in 2007. For 2008, renewal and replacement capital expenditures were approximately $374 million, as compared to $267 million in 2007. Our renewal and
replacement capital expenditures are generally funded by the furniture, fixtures and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels (typically funded with approximately 5% of property revenues) and by our available cash. We also spent
approximately $321 million on repositioning/ROI and value enhancement projects in 2008, as compared to $346 million in 2007. These projects are expected to enhance the competitiveness of our properties and should help drive operating
performance, particularly during the current economic recession, by separating and differentiating our properties from those of our competitors. As a result of this extensive capital expenditure program, we believe that our properties will remain in
a strong competitive position with respect to their market competitors despite our planned reduction in capital expenditures in 2009.

Sources and Uses of Cash

During 2008, our primary sources of cash included cash from operations, proceeds from debt
issuances and refinancings and proceeds from hotel dispositions. Uses of cash during the year primarily consisted of capital


expenditures, dividend payments, stock repurchases and debt repayments and repurchases. Significant uses of cash during 2009 will include the repayment or
repurchase of our debt maturing in the near-term, capital expenditures at our hotels and dividends on our common and preferred stock. Other uses may include, among others, investment in our European and Asian joint ventures or hotel acquisitions. We
anticipate that our primary sources of cash for 2009 will include cash from operations and proceeds from hotel dispositions and debt or equity issuances.

Cash Provided by Operations

.    Our cash provided by operations for 2008 increased $19 million to $1.0 billion compared to 2007, due primarily to a reduction in interest expense
which was partially offset by declines in operations at our hotels.

Cash Used in Investing
Activities

.    Approximately $716 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2008. This included approximately $672 million of capital expenditures (net of the $23 million deposit) and $77 million of
investments primarily in our European joint venture, partially offset by $38 million of proceeds from the dispositions of the Sheraton Tampa Suites Airport and the Host Airport Hotel Sacramento.

The following table summarizes significant investing activities that have been completed since the beginning of January 2007 (in millions):

(1)

Represents our investments for the acquisitions of the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam City Centre, as well as our investments to acquire a portfolio of hotels. The portfolio transaction was
terminated in 2008 and therefore the European joint venture returned approximately $40 million of these funds in January 2009.

(2)

Represents our investment for the acquisition of three hotels located in Brussels, Belgium.


Cash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities

.    Net cash used in financing
activities was $284 million for 2008, as compared to $685 million in 2007. During 2008 and 2007, cash used in financing activities consisted of debt prepayments or repurchases and equity repurchases of approximately $427 million and
$1.3 billion, respectively, and scheduled principal repayments of $16 million and $35 million, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities in 2008 and 2007 included the issuance of debt securities for proceeds of approximately
$702 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, net of financing costs.

During 2008 and 2007, our common stock dividend payments increased
$78 million to $522 million as the 2008 dividend payments included the payment of the $.40 per share fourth quarter 2007 dividend compared to the $.25 fourth quarter 2006 dividend that was paid in 2007. We also paid $9 million for both
2008 and 2007, respectively, of dividends on our preferred stock.


The following table summarizes significant debt (net of deferred financing costs) and equity transactions
since the beginning of January 2007 (in millions):

(1)

The Orlando World Center Marriott mortgage loan has a floating rate of interest of LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The interest rate shown reflects the rate in effect as of
December 31, 2008.

(2)

The JW Marriott, Washington, D.C. mortgage debt had a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 210 basis points. The interest rate shown reflects the rate as of the date of the
transaction.


Financial Condition

As of December 31, 2008, our total debt was approximately $6.0 billion of which 88% carried a fixed rate of interest. Total debt was comprised of (in millions):

Aggregate debt maturities at December 31, 2008 are as follows (in millions):

(1)

The debt maturing in 2011 includes $410 million related to borrowings under the credit facility, which can be extended, at our option, for one year if our leverage ratio is below
6.75x. See “—Financial Condition” for further discussion. Similarly, the $300 million mortgage loan on the Orlando World Center Marriott, which also matures in 2011, can be extended for two, one-year periods, subject to achieving a
certain debt coverage ratio and other conditions.

Senior Notes

General.

The following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior
notes issued by Host LP, which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes at specified dates in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under
the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host LP’s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host LP. The notes outstanding under our senior notes
indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and currently are secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture,
as well as our credit facility, certain other senior debt, and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. The pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage
ratio falls below 6.0x for


two consecutive fiscal quarters. Because our leverage ratio is below this threshold, we have the right to release all pledges at any time. In October 2005,
we exercised this right for pledges of capital stock that would have been otherwise required subsequent to this date.

Restrictive
Covenants

.    Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an
EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0x by Host LP. Furthermore, Host LP is able to make distributions to enable Host to pay dividends on its preferred stock under the senior notes indenture when our EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is
above 1.7 to 1.0. This ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as
if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the
credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value, and, in 2009, approximately $30 million of interest expense to be recorded as a result of the adoption of
FSP APB 14-1 relating to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends include maintaining
total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate values) excluding intangible assets and secured indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets. So long as we maintain the required level of
interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, we may pay preferred or common dividends and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture, including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition.
In addition, even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and pay dividends, we are still permitted to incur certain types of debt, including (i) credit facility debt, (ii) refinancing debt, (iii) up to
$300 million of mortgage debt whose proceeds would be used to repay debt under credit facility (and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount), and (iv) up to $100 million of other debt. Our senior notes
indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters, such as our ability to pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our equity interests; make investments; permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries; sell assets;
guarantee indebtedness; enter into transactions with affiliates; create certain liens; and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. Our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets (as defined
in the indenture as undepreciated property value) of not less than 125% of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages. This coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage
requirements necessary to incur debt or pay dividends discussed above (whose consequences, where we fall below the coverage level, are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or pay dividends, but which would not otherwise cause a
default under our senior notes indenture). As of December 31, 2008, we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under our senior notes indentures.

2007 Exchangeable Senior Debentures.

On March 23, 2007, Host LP
issued $600 million 2


/


% Exchangeable
Senior Debentures (the “2007 Debentures”) and received proceeds of $589 million, net of underwriting fees and expenses and original issue discount. The 2007 Debentures mature on April 15, 2027 and are equal in right of payment
with all of our other senior notes. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year beginning on July 15, 2007. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, the 2007
Debentures at any time on or after April 20, 2012 upon 15 days notice at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase the 2007 Debentures on April 15, 2012,
April 15, 2017 and April 15, 2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders may exchange their 2007 Debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions, including when the closing sale price of
Host’s common stock is more than 130% of the exchange price per share for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption. On
exchange, we must deliver cash in an amount equal to not less than the lower of the exchange value (which is the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the average price of our common shares) and the aggregate principal amount of the 2007


Debentures to be exchanged and, at our option, shares, cash or a combination thereof for any excess above the principal value. If we elect to redeem the
debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures at the exchange value described above rather than receive the cash redemption price. The current exchange rate is
31.35 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, which is equivalent to an exchange price of $31.90 per share of Host common stock. The exchange rate may be adjusted under certain circumstances including the payment of
common dividends exceeding $.20 per share in any given quarter. The 2007 Debentures are not currently exchangeable.

2004 Exchangeable
Senior Debentures.

On March 16, 2004, Host LP issued $500 million of 3.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (the “2004 Debentures”) and received net proceeds of $484 million, net of discounts,
underwriting fees and expenses. During 2008, we repurchased $100 million principal amount of the 2004 Debentures for approximately $82 million and recorded a gain on the repurchase of approximately $18 million. The outstanding 2004 Debentures mature
on April 15, 2024 and are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. Holders have the right
to require us to repurchase the 2004 Debentures on April 15, 2010, April 15, 2014 and April 15, 2019 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount. Holders may exchange their 2004 Debentures prior to maturity under certain
conditions, including at any time at which the closing sale price of our common stock is more than 120% of the exchange price per share, for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days prior to the
date on which the debentures have been called for redemption. The current exchange rate is 63.3687 shares for each $1,000 of principal amount of the 2004 Debentures, (which is equivalent to an exchange price of $15.78 per share). The exchange rate
is adjusted for certain circumstances, including the payment of common dividends. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, the 2004 Debentures at any time subsequent to April 19, 2009 upon 30 days notice at the applicable redemption price as set
forth in the indenture. If we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures for stock rather than receive the cash redemption price. The 2004
Debentures are not currently exchangeable.

Credit Facility

General.

On May 25, 2007, we entered into a second amended and restated bank credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG New
York Branch, as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Citicorp North America Inc., Société Générale and Calyon New York Branch, as Co-Documentation Agents and certain other agents and lenders.
The credit facility provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of $600 million. During any period in which our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate
outstanding principal amount under the credit facility to exceed $300 million. The credit facility also includes subcommitments for (i) the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of $10 million and (ii) loans in
certain foreign currencies in an aggregate amount of $300 million, (A) $150 million of which may be loaned to certain of our Canadian subsidiaries in Canadian Dollars and (B) $300 million of which may be loaned to us in
Pounds Sterling and Euros. The credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of September 2011. We have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met as of September 2011. These conditions include the
payment of a fee to the lenders, that no default or event of default exists and maintaining a leverage ratio below 6.75x. Subject to certain conditions, we also have the option to increase the amount of the facility by up to $190 million to the
extent that any one or more lenders, whether or not currently party to the credit facility, commits to be a lender for such amount.

In the
second quarter of 2008, we entered into a $210 million term loan under the credit facility. The term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points, with a LIBOR floor of 2.25% for an all-in rate of 4.0% at December 31, 2008. We also have
the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points and the Prime Lending Rate, plus, in both cases, the applicable spread of 75 basis points. In September 2008, we also borrowed $200 million under
the revolver portion of our credit facility at a rate of LIBOR plus 65 basis points based on our current leverage. Based on our current leverage, we have $400 million of remaining available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility.


The obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are
currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The pledges are permitted to be released in the event that certain conditions are satisfied, including the requirement that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for two
consecutive fiscal quarters. As a result of having satisfied such conditions, currently we are not required to pledge our equity interests in any newly acquired or formed subsidiary, and at our election, we may obtain a release of all existing
pledges for so long as our leverage ratio continues to be below 6.0x. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility, as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture and interest rate swap agreements and other
hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility.

Financial Covenants.

The credit
facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. Prior to the end of our third quarter of 2009, we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit
facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 7.5x and our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x. Thereafter, the maximum leverage ratio under the credit facility is reduced to 7.25x, with the minimum unsecured coverage ratio
continuing to be set at 1.75x. In all cases, if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the credit facility to exceed $300 million.
However, to the extent our borrowings under the credit facility revolver exceed $300 million on the date that our leverage ratio exceeds 7.0x, we are not required to repay the excess for one year. The financial covenants for the credit facility do
not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility. Hence, so long as there are no amounts outstanding, we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit
facility in the future if we were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants. These calculations are performed in accordance with our credit facility based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters giving effect to
transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt,
deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value, and, in 2009, approximately $30 million of
interest expense to be recorded as a result of the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 relating to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in
the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a “net debt” concept under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million is deducted from our total debt balance. As of December 31, 2008, our leverage ratio was 4.1x
versus the 7.5x maximum leverage ratio allowed under the credit facility, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.8x versus the 1.0x minimum fixed charge coverage ratio allowed under the credit facility and our unsecured interest coverage ratio was
4.1x versus the minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of 1.75x allowed under the credit facility. Accordingly, we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility as of December 31, 2008.

The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility:

(a)

If, at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will lower to 1.5x.

(b)

The maximum leverage ratio declines to 7.25x in September 2009.

Interest and Fees.

We pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates plus a margin that is set with reference to our leverage ratio. In the case of LIBOR borrowings in US
Dollars, as well as Euros and Pounds Sterling denominated borrowings, the rate of interest ranges from 65 basis points to 150 basis points over LIBOR. We also have the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight Federal Funds Rate
plus 50 basis points and the Prime Lending Rate, plus, in both cases, the applicable spread ranging from 0 to


50 basis points. Based on our current leverage ratio of 4.1x, we can borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 70 basis points or Prime plus 0 basis points. To the
extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment of 10 to 15 basis points, depending on our average revolver usage during the applicable period.

Other Covenants.

The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants become less
restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x. In particular, at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures, and the limitations on acquisitions, investments and
dividends contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture. Additionally, the credit facility’s restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of
dividends are generally consistent with our senior notes indenture. These provisions, under certain circumstances, limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing, and limit dividend payments to
those necessary to maintain our tax status as a REIT.

Mortgage and Other Debt

General

.    As of December 31, 2008, we had 14 hotels that were secured by mortgage debt. Substantially all of our
mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2008, secured debt represented approximately 24% of our total debt and our
aggregate secured debt had an average interest rate of 6.2% and an average maturity of 4.3 years.

The following table summarizes our
outstanding debt and scheduled amortization and maturities related to mortgage and other debt as of December 31, 2008 (in millions):


(1)

This floating rate mortgage is based on LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The rate shown is the rate in effect as of December 31, 2008.

(2)

Beginning in 2010, the interest rate on these loans increases a minimum of 200 basis points and all excess cash (as defined in the loan agreement) generated by the partnerships that
own these properties is applied to principal; however, the loans can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date. The amortization presented is the minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate, but does not include
additional principal payments based on excess cash flow.

(3)

Other mortgage debt consists of individual mortgage debt amounts that are less than $40 million, have an average interest rate of 6.1% at December 31, 2008 and mature
through 2022. Beginning in 2009, the interest rate on one of these loans, the Westin Indianapolis, with a principal balance of $34 million increases a minimum of 500 basis points and all excess cash (as defined in the loan agreement) generated by
the partnership that owns the property is applied to principal; however, the loan can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date. We have notified the lender that we will prepay this loan in March 2009. The amortization presented is the
minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate, but does not include additional principal payments based on excess cash flow.

(4)

Industrial revenue bonds and other consist of loans with an average interest rate of 7.1% that mature through 2016, and capital leases with varying interest rates and maturity
dates.

Mortgage Debt of Consolidated and Unconsolidated Partner Interests

For the entities that we consolidate in our financial statements that have third party minority partnership interests, the proportion of mortgage debt
included in the above table that is attributable to the minority owners, based on their percentage of ownership of the partnerships, is approximately $68 million. Additionally, we have minority interests in partnerships and joint ventures that
are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method. The proportion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships attributable to us, based on our percentage of ownership of the partnerships, was $356 million at
December 31, 2008. Approximately 90% of this debt balance is attributable to our 32.1% ownership interest in the European joint venture. The mortgage debt related to our European joint venture hotels contains operating covenants that could
result in the joint venture being required to escrow cash from operations or make principal repayments without penalty. The debt of all our unconsolidated partnerships is non-recourse to us.

Credit Ratings

Currently, we
have approximately $4.0 billion of senior notes outstanding and $100 million of preferred stock that are rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Moody’s rating on our senior note
debt is Ba1 and our preferred stock is Ba2. During 2009, Standard & Poor’s downgraded our senior note debt one notch from BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating, to BB+. Standard & Poor’s rating on our preferred stock
was also downgraded one notch from B to B-. In addition, Standard & Poor’s has maintained its negative outlook. During 2009, Fitch Ratings downgraded our senior note debt from BB+ to BB-. The rating on our preferred stock was also
downgraded from BB- to B. Fitch Ratings has also placed us on negative outlook. If our operations or our credit ratios continue to decline, the ratings on our securities could be further reduced. If we were unable to subsequently improve our credit
ratings, our cost to issue senior notes, either in connection with a refinancing or otherwise, or additional preferred stock would likely increase.

Dividend Policy

Host is required to distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income, excluding net capital
gains, to its stockholders to qualify as a REIT, including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash. Funds used by Host to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock are provided
through distributions from Host LP. Currently, for every share of common and preferred stock of Host, Host LP has issued to Host a corresponding common OP unit and preferred OP unit. As of February 23, 2009, Host is the owner of substantially
all of the preferred OP units and approximately 97% of the common OP units. The remaining 3% of the common OP units are held by various third-party limited partners.

Investors should take into account the 3% minority position in Host LP common OP units when analyzing common and preferred dividend payments by Host to its stockholders, as these holders share, on a pro rata basis, in
amounts being distributed by Host LP to holders of its corresponding common and preferred OP units. When


Host pays a common or preferred dividend, Host LP pays an equivalent per unit distribution on all common or corresponding preferred OP units. For example, if
Host paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on payment of a $1 per common unit distribution by Host LP to Host, as well as to other common OP unit holders.

Host’s current policy on common dividends is generally to distribute, over time, 100% of its taxable income. We intend to suspend our regular
quarterly dividend in 2009 and instead we expect to declare a $.30 to $.35 per share common dividend in the fourth quarter, which may be paid either in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The amount of any dividend will be
determined by Host’s Board of Directors. In reliance on the specific terms of recent guidance issued by the IRS, we may pay up to 90% of our required 2009 common dividends with Host common stock, with the remaining 10% paid with cash. Host
currently intends to continue paying dividends on its preferred stock, regardless of the amount of taxable income, unless contractually restricted.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are party to various transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities (which we refer to as “off-balance
sheet arrangements”) under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees. As of December 31, 2008, we are party to the following material off-balance sheet arrangements:

Unconsolidated Investments

.    We have invested approximately €137 million ($181 million) in the European joint
venture, which includes amounts for the acquisition of a portfolio of hotels. The acquisition was terminated in December 2008, and the European joint venture returned approximately $40 million of the invested funds to us in January 2009 reducing our
investment to approximately €107 million. Under the joint venture’s partnership agreement, the aggregate size of the European joint venture can increase to approximately €540 million of equity (of which approximately
€173 million would be contributed by Host LP) and, once all funds have been invested, would be approximately €1.5 billion of assets. The European joint venture currently has €733.8 million of debt outstanding, none of
which is recourse to us.

As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate size of the European joint venture was approximately
€1.3 billion ($1.8 billion), including total capital contributions of approximately €433 million ($567 million), of which a total of approximately €137 million ($181 million) was from the contribution by us of cash
and the Sheraton Warsaw Hotel & Towers.

During 2008, we entered into three foreign currency forward purchase contracts to hedge
approximately 50% of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the European joint venture. We hedged €60 million (approximately $88 million) of our investment and the forward
purchase will occur between August 2011 and May 2014. As of December 31, 2008, we have recorded approximately $6 million related to the increase in the fair value of the forward purchase contracts. The gain is included in accumulated other
comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheet. The derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, and, in accordance with SFAS 133, are marked-to-market with changes in
fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the stockholders’ equity portion of our balance sheet.

We also
have other unconsolidated investments with a total of $810 million in debt with various partners. For additional detail on these investments and the European joint venture, see Note 3, “Investments in Affiliates,” and
Note 7, “Leases,” in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Tax Sharing
Arrangements

.    Under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies (such as Marriott International, HMS Host and Barceló Crestline Corporation), we are obligated to pay certain taxes (federal, state, local
and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) relating to periods in which the


companies were affiliated with us. For example, a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former
affiliate was owned by us. This adjustment could produce a material tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement. Additionally, under the partnership agreement between Host and Host LP, Host LP is obligated to pay
certain taxes (federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) incurred by Host, as well as any liabilities the IRS may successfully assert against Host. We do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing
arrangements to be material.

Tax Indemnification Agreements.

For reasons relating to federal and state
income tax considerations of the former and current owners of three hotels, we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels, or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel. Two of these agreements will
expire in 2010 and the third will expire in 2028.

Guarantees

.    We have certain guarantees, which consist of
commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt, that are not on our books due to various dispositions, spin-offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an
unrelated party. We consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote. The largest guarantees (by dollar amount) are listed below:

•

We remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non-lodging properties. These primarily represent certain divested restaurants that were sold
subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments. The aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately $23 million as of December 31, 2008.

•

In 1997, we owned Leisure Park Venture Limited Partnership, which owns and operates a senior living facility. We no longer have an ownership interest in the
partnership, but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to $14.7 million of municipal bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority through their maturity in 2027. However, to the extent we
are required to make any payments under the guarantee, we have been indemnified by Barceló Crestline Corporation, who, in turn, is indemnified by the current owner of the facility.

•

In connection with the sale of two hotels in January 2005, we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases. The future minimum
lease payments are approximately $13 million through the full term of the leases, including renewal options. We believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote, and in each case, we have been indemnified by the purchaser of
the hotel.

Information on other guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in Note 17 to our
consolidated financial statements.


Contractual Obligations

The table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt, future minimum lease payments on our operating and
capital leases, projected capital expenditures and other long-term liabilities, each as of December 31, 2008 (in millions):

(1)

The amounts shown include amortization of principal, debt maturities and estimated interest payments. Interest payments have been included in the long-term debt obligations based on
the weighted average interest rate.

(2)

Future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the HPT subleases of approximately $9 million and
$275 million, respectively, payable to us under non-cancelable subleases.

(3)

Our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels. Under our contracts, we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later
years and some of the 2008 amount reflects prior year contracts that were deferred or not completed. See “Capital Expenditures.”

(4)

The amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense based upon FIN 48. Under terms of our management agreements, we have deferred payment of
management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owner’s priority to us. The timing of the payments, if any, is based on future operations, the termination of
the management agreement or the sale of the hotel, and, is therefore, not determinable. The estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years based upon FIN 48.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties
and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following represent certain critical accounting
policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates:

•

Purchase Price Allocations to Hotels

.    Investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost and allocated to land, property
and equipment, identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,

Business Combinations

. Any remaining unallocated acquisition costs
would be treated as goodwill. Property and equipment are recorded at fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations
performed by management and independent third parties. Identifiable intangible assets are typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements, which are recorded at fair value, although no value is
generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms. Above-market and below-market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of
the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the


remaining non-cancelable term of the contract. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable term of the
related agreements. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data, including
third-party appraisals and valuations.

•

Impairment testing

.    We are required by GAAP to record an impairment charge when we believe that one or more of our hotels has been
impaired, whereby, future undiscounted cash flows for the hotel would be less than the net book value of the asset. For impaired assets, we record an impairment charge when a property’s fair value is less than its net book value. We test for
impairment in several situations, including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows, when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life, as well as
whenever an asset is classified as “held for sale” or events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset’s net book value may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the impairment of our assets, we make many assumptions and
estimates, including:

•

projected cash flows

•

holding period

•

expected useful life

•

future capital expenditures

•

fair values, including consideration of capitalization rates, discount rates and comparable selling prices.

Changes in these estimates, assumptions, future changes in economic conditions, or property-level results could require us to record additional
impairment charges, which would be reflected in operations in the future.

•

Classification of Assets as “Held for Sale”.

Our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale
of the asset is probable, will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the planned sale will be withdrawn. This policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions
under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed, the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being
completed in a timely manner. Specifically, we will typically classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met:

•

our Board of Directors has approved the sale (to the extent the dollar amount of the sale requires Board approval);

•

a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed;

•

the buyer has committed a significant amount of non-refundable cash; and

•

no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner.

To the extent a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property, we will
record an impairment loss. See the discussion above concerning the use of estimates and judgments in determining fair values for impairment tests.

•

Depreciation and Amortization Expense.

Depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization
expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. The lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and
refurbish the assets, as well as specific market and economic conditions. While management believes its estimates are


reasonable, a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income (loss) or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels.

•

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets.

We have approximately $79 million, net of a valuation allowance of $28 million, of
consolidated deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008. The objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities
and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company’s financial statements or tax returns. We have considered various factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future
projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the $79 million of deferred tax assets in the
future. When a determination is made that all, or a portion, of the deferred tax assets may not be realized, an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period.

•

Valuation of Derivative Contracts.

We will occasionally enter into derivative products including interest rate and foreign currency
swaps, caps and collars. Derivative instruments are fair valued at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income (loss) unless the instrument qualifies as a hedge under SFAS 133. We estimate the fair value
of these instruments through the use of third party valuations, which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to
appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have
considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. The variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from
observed market interest and exchange rate curves. The values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change. Any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest
or exchange rates will impact our valuations. The fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity.

Stock Compensation.

We recognize costs resulting from our share-based payment transactions in our financial statements over their
vesting periods. We classify share-based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity classified awards or liability classified awards. The classification of our restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a
liability award is based upon cash settlement options. Equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. Liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. The value of these restricted
stock awards, less estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award – the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is
recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service. The majority of our restricted stock awards to senior management vested as of December 31, 2008. These awards were classified as liability awards due to settlement
features that allowed the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax requirements in excess of the statutory minimum requirements. During 2009, we will implement a new employee stock plan for our senior
management that will include the following awards:

Restricted stock awards with vesting based on market
conditions.

These awards will be considered liability awards due to their cash settlement features. Therefore, they will be remeasured to fair value each reporting period. We utilize a simulation, or Monte Carlo model to
determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions. The utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock, risk-free interest
rates, the risk profile of our common shares compared to our peer group and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited.


Restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance conditions.

These
awards are earned based on an employee’s achieving a specified performance target, which will be based on the employee’s specific management business objectives. Compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance
condition is considered probable of achievement. If a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable of achievement, recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome. These awards are
also considered liability awards due to the cash-settlement provisions. Therefore, the value of the shares to be issued will be based on the share price on the reporting date.

Stock Option Awards.

The stock option awards will be equity-based awards, as they will not include cash settlement features.
Therefore, the value of the award will be determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and will not be adjusted for future changes in the fair value. The utilization of the binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related
to the volatility of the share price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited.

We also grant restricted stock awards to our upper-middle management with vesting based on service conditions. These awards are considered equity awards as they do not have an option for tax withholding similar to that for senior
management.

•

Consolidation Policies.

Judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the
evaluation of control, including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights, as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests. Currently, we have investments in
entities that own hotel properties and other investments which we record using the equity method of accounting. These entities are considered to be voting interest entities. The debt on these investments is non-recourse to us and the effect of their
operations on our results of operations is not material. While we do not believe we are required to consolidate any of our current partnerships or joint ventures presented under the equity method, if we were required to do so, then all of the
results of operations and the assets and liabilities would be included in our financial statements.

Application of
New Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007),

Business Combinations,

(“FAS
141R”). FAS 141R provides principles on the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination. The standard
particularly requires the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests to be measured at the acquisition date fair value, including contingent consideration. Furthermore, FAS 141R prohibits acquisition-related costs, such as due
diligence, legal and accounting fees, from being applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets. We will adopt the provisions of this statement beginning in the first quarter of 2009 prospectively. We do not believe the adoption of
this statement will materially affect the recognition and measurement related to our future business combinations.

In December 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51,

(“FAS 160”), which defines a noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary as “the portion of the
equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent” and requires noncontrolling interest to be presented as a separate component of equity in the consolidated balance sheet. FAS 160 also modifies the
presentation of net income by requiring earnings and other comprehensive income to be attributed to controlling and noncontrolling interests. We will adopt this standard beginning in the first quarter of 2009 prospectively and any presentation and
disclosure requirements retrospectively. Upon the adoption of this standard, we will reclassify interests of our minority partners of other consolidated partnerships from the mezzanine level of the balance sheet to stockholders’ equity.
Interest of minority partners of Host L.P. will continue to be classified in the minority interest section of our balance sheet, as the OP Units do not meet the requirements for equity classification per EITF topic D-98. Upon adoption, the


interest of minority partners of Host LP will be carried at fair value. As of December 31, 2008, the balance to be reclassified totaled
$24 million. Additionally, the income attributable to minority partners of Host L.P. and other consolidated partnerships will no longer be deducted in our determination of net income and net income would have increased by $21 million,
$32 million and $41 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. However, the income attributable to minority partners will be deducted in our determination of net income available to common shareholders. Therefore, we do not anticipate
that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our income available to common shareholders or our diluted earnings per share.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB staff position (“FSP”) APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)”
(“FSP 14-1”). FSP 14-1 specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the
instrument’s issuance date when interest cost is recognized. Our 2007 Debentures and our 2004 Debentures are within the scope of FSP 14-1; therefore, we will be required to record the debt components of the debentures at fair value as of
the date of issuance and amortize the discount as an increase to interest expense over the expected life of the debt. The implementation of this standard will result in a decrease to net income and earnings per share for all periods presented;
however, there is no effect on our cash interest payments. FSP 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years and shall be applied
retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption of FSP 14-1 is not permitted. As a result of the application of this standard, our diluted earnings per common share are estimated to decrease by approximately $.04 to $.05 per share.
Additionally, the application of this standard will decrease our debt balance as of December 31, 2008 by approximately $77 million, with a corresponding increase to stockholders’ equity.

Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics

We present
certain operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses and adjusted operating profit) for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis. We define our
comparable hotels as properties (i) that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results, whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being
compared and (ii) that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large-scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared.

Of the 117 hotels that we owned on December 31, 2008, 115 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following hotels
that we owned as of December 31, 2008 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

•

Atlanta Marriott Marquis (a two-year major renovation project that was completed in June 2008); and

•

New Orleans Marriott (property damage and business interruption from Hurricane Katrina in August 2005).

Additionally, the operating results of the eleven hotels we disposed of in 2008 and 2007 also are not included in comparable hotel results for the
periods presented herein. Moreover, because these statistics and operating results are for our hotel properties, they exclude results for our non-hotel properties and other real estate investments.

We evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type. These divisions are generally
consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry.

Geographic regions consist of the following (only states in which we own
hotels are listed):

•

Pacific—California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington;

•

Mountain—Arizona and Colorado;


•

North Central—Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio;

•

South Central—Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas;

•

New England—Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire;

•

Mid-Atlantic—Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York;

•

DC Metro—Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.;

•

Atlanta—Georgia and North Carolina;

•

Florida—Florida; and

•

International—Canada, Mexico and Chile.

Property types consist of the following:

•

Urban—Hotels located in primary business districts of major cities;

•

Suburban—Hotels located in office parks or smaller secondary markets;

•

Resort/conference—Hotels located in resort/conference destinations such as Arizona, Florida, Hawaii and Southern California; and

•

Airport—Hotels located at or near airports.

Reporting Periods

For Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The
results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers. Our hotel managers use different reporting periods. Marriott, the manager of a significant percentage of our properties, uses a year ending on the Friday
closest to December 31 and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its Marriott-managed hotels. In contrast, other managers of our hotels, such as
Hyatt and Starwood, report results on a monthly basis. Host, as a REIT, is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year. As a result, we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by Marriott modified so that our fiscal
year always ends on December 31 to comply with REIT rules. Our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as Marriott but our fourth quarter ends on December 31 and our full year results, as reported in our statement of
operations, always includes the same number of days as the calendar year.

Two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are:
(1) quarterly start dates will usually differ between years, except for the first quarter which always commences on January 1, and (2) our first and fourth quarters of operations and year-to-date operations may not include the same
number of days as reflected in prior years. For example, set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for 2009, 2008 and 2007. Note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations. In contrast, the
first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations.

While the reporting calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used
by Marriott, another consequence of our calendar is we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter-end until the following quarter because our hotel managers using a monthly reporting period do


not make mid-month results available to us. Hence, the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter-end is included in our quarterly results of
operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers (covering approximately 43% of total revenues of our hotels). As a result, our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as
follows: first quarter (January, February), second quarter (March to May), third quarter (June to August) and fourth quarter (September to December). While this does not affect full year results, it does affect the reporting of quarterly results.

For Hotel Operating Statistics and Comparable Hotel Results.

In contrast to the reporting periods for our
consolidated statement of operations, our hotel operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and our comparable hotel results are reported based on the reporting cycle used by Marriott for our Marriott-managed
hotels. However, for years such as 2008, where Marriott reports its operations based on a 53-week year and a fourth quarter of 17 weeks, for comparable purposes, we exclude the extra week of operations, and we still reflect 52 weeks for the full
year and 16 weeks for the fourth quarter. This facilitates year-to-year comparisons, as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year. This means, however, that the reporting periods we use for
hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results will typically differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year. Set forth below are the quarterly start
and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein. Results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent
with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations.

and Comparable Hotel Results—for Marriott Managed Properties

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC
rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO per diluted share, and (ii) Comparable Hotel Operating Results. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance.

FFO Per Diluted Share

We
present FFO per diluted share as a non-GAAP measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate FFO per diluted share for a given operating period as our FFO (defined as set forth
below) for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect
of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive
securities, including the payment of preferred stock dividends, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines.

We believe that FFO per diluted
share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding
the effect of real estate depreciation,


amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in
evaluating current performance, we believe that such measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs, even though FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders
of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its April 2002 “White Paper on Funds From Operations,”
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by
themselves. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the definition of FFO in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

We calculate FFO per diluted share, in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or calculate FFO per diluted share in
accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although FFO per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. This information should not be considered
as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) and other
items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to
operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include depreciation, capital expenditures and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our
performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. FFO per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash
distributions. In addition, FFO per diluted share does not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to our stockholders’ benefit.


The following tables provide a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders per share to
FFO per diluted share (in millions, except per share amounts):

Reconciliation of Net Income Available to

Common Stockholders to Funds From Operations per Diluted Share

(a)

Represents the gain during the period from the settlement of property insurance claims, including the gains that are included in discontinued operations related to hotels that we
have sold.

(b)

Represents FFO attributable to the minority interests in Host LP.

(c)

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased $100 million principal amount of the 2004 Exchangeable Senior Debentures for $82 million. Under FASB’s Emerging Issues Task
Force Topic D-53, “

Computation of Earnings per Share for a Period that Includes a Redemption or an Induced Conversion of a Portion of a Class of Preferred Stock”

(EITF D-53) we are required to determine the dilutive effect of the
repurchased 2004 Exchangeable Debentures separately from the 2004 Exchangeable Debentures outstanding at December 31, 2008. 2004 Exchangeable Debentures repurchased during 2008 are treated as having been converted to common stock equivalents at
the start of the period. Accordingly, the adjustments to dilutive FFO related to the 2004 Exchangeable Senior Debentures consist of an add-back of $19 million of interest expense netted with the $18 million gain realized on the repurchases, for a
net effect of $1 million.

(d)

FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT is adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans,
those preferred OP units held by minority partners, convertible debt securities and other minority interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interest to common OP units. No effect is shown for securities if they are
anti-dilutive.

(e)

FFO per diluted share and earnings per diluted share for certain periods presented were significantly affected by certain transactions, the effect of which is shown in the table
below (in millions, except per share amounts):


(1)

Represents call premiums, the acceleration of original issue discounts and deferred financing costs, the termination costs of interest rate swaps, as well as incremental interest
during the call or prepayment notice period included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. We recognized these costs in conjunction with the prepayment or refinancing of senior notes and mortgages during certain periods
presented.

(2)

Represents the portion of the significant transactions attributable to minority partners in Host LP.

Comparable Hotel Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, and adjusted operating profit, on a comparable hotel, or “same store” basis as supplemental information for investors. We present these
comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate-level costs and expenses related to our capital structure, as well as depreciation and amortization. We eliminate corporate-level costs and expenses to arrive at property-level results
because we believe property-level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels. We eliminate depreciation and amortization, because even though depreciation and amortization are
property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate
values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.

As a result of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization, the comparable hotel operating results we present
do not represent our total revenues, expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the
impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when
evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides
investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in
distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors, such as the effect of acquisitions
or dispositions. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a “same store” supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate
resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results. For these reasons, we believe that comparable hotel operating results,
when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.


The following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable hotels for the
periods presented herein:

Comparable Hotel Results(a)

(in millions, except hotel statistics)

(a)

The reporting period for 2008 for the Marriott-managed hotels is from December 29, 2007 to December 26, 2008 and for 2007 is from December 30, 2006 to
December 28, 2007.

(b)

The reconciliation of total revenues per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable hotel sales is as follows:

(c)

The reconciliation of total food and beverage sales per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable food and beverage sales is as follows:


(d)

The reconciliation of operating costs per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable hotel expenses is as follows:

(e)

The reconciliation of total food and beverage expenses per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable food and beverage expenses is as follows:

(f)

Non-comparable hotel results, net, includes the following items: (i) the results of operations of our non-comparable hotels whose operations are included in our consolidated
statements of operations as continuing operations and (ii) the difference between the number of days of operations reflected in the comparable hotel results and the number of days of operations reflected in the consolidated statements of
operations.

(g)

Represents rental income less rental expense for select service properties and office buildings.


Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent
upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Valuations for secured debt are determined based on the expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted
rates. Senior notes and the Exchangeable Debentures are valued based on quoted market prices. Currently, we have no derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge interest rate risk or that are held for trading purposes. However, going
forward, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to future borrowings.

The table
below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

(1)

The debt maturing in 2011 includes $410 million related to borrowings under the credit facility, which can be extended, at our option, for one year if our leverage ratio is below
6.75x. See “—Financial Condition” for further discussion. Similarly, the $300 million mortgage loan on the Orlando World Center Marriott, which also matures in 2011, can be extended for two one-year periods, subject to achieving a
certain debt coverage ratio and other conditions.

Our current debt structure, which primarily consists of fixed rate debt
largely mitigates the impact of changes in interest rates on our cash interest payments. As of December 31, 2008, we had a $210 million term loan and $200 million outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Our credit
facility borrowings are sensitive to changes in interest rates, and are based on a spread over LIBOR, ranging from 65 basis points to 175 basis points depending on our leverage ratio. Additionally, in 2008 we entered into a $300 million floating
rate mortgage loan on our Orlando World Center Marriott that bears interest at LIBOR plus 350 basis points.

Valuations for secured debt
and the credit facility are determined based on the expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates. Senior notes and the Exchangeable Senior Debentures are valued based on quoted market prices.

During March 2007, we prepaid our $88 million mortgage on the JW Marriott, Washington, D.C. As a result, we terminated an interest rate cap that
capped the floating interest rate of the loan at 8.1%. The cap represented a derivative that was marked to market each period and the gains and losses from changes in the market value of the cap were recorded in gain (loss) on foreign currency and
derivative contracts.

If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the change in
interest expense would change future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7 million annually.

Exchange Rate Sensitivity

As we have non-U.S. operations (specifically, the ownership of hotels in Canada, Mexico and Chile and investments in our European joint venture), currency
exchange risk arises as a normal part of our business. To


manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non-U.S. hotels, where possible, we may enter into forward or option contracts. The foreign
currency exchange agreements that we have entered into were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes.

During
2008, we have entered into three foreign currency forward purchase contracts totaling €60 million (approximately $88 million) to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net
investment in the European joint venture. Under these transactions, we will sell the Euro amount, and receive the U.S. Dollar amount on the forward purchase date. These derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a
net investment in a foreign operation, and, in accordance with SFAS 133, are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the stockholders’ equity portion of our balance sheet. We
also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps. During 2008, we recorded an increase in the fair value of the derivative instruments totaling approximately $6 million, which is equal to the fair value
as of December 31, 2008 included in accumulated other comprehensive income. The following table summarizes our three foreign currency purchase contracts (in millions):

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The
following financial information is included on the pages indicated:

Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Host Hotels & Resorts,
Inc.:

We have audited Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)

.

Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Item 9a

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

of Form 10-K. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets
of Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Host Hotels & Resorts,
Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. In connection
with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule III as listed in the index as item 15(a)(ii). These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., or Host, a Maryland corporation that operates through an
umbrella partnership structure, is primarily the owner of hotel properties. We operate as a self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, with our operations conducted solely through an operating partnership, Host
Hotels & Resorts, L.P., or Host LP and its subsidiaries. We are the sole general partner of Host LP and as of December 31, 2008, own approximately 97% of the partnership interests, which are referred to as OP units.

As of December 31, 2008, we owned, or had controlling interests in, 117 luxury and
upper-upscale, hotel lodging properties located throughout the United States, Toronto and Calgary, Canada, Mexico City, Mexico and Santiago, Chile operated primarily under the Marriott

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates. If we determine
that we are an owner in a variable interest entity and that our variable interest will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns if they occur, or both,
then we will consolidate the entity. Additionally, we consolidate entities (in the absence of other factors determining control) when we own over 50% of the voting shares of another company or, in the case of partnership investments, when we own a
majority of the general partnership interest. The control factors we consider include the ability of minority stockholders or other partners to participate in or block management decisions. All material intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash
includes reserves for debt service, real estate taxes, insurance, furniture, fixtures and equipment, as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits due to mortgage debt agreement restrictions and provisions. For purposes of the statement
of cash flows, changes in restricted cash that are used for furniture, fixture and equipment reserves controlled by our lenders are shown as investing activities. The remaining changes in restricted cash are the direct result of restrictions under
our loan agreements, and, as such, are reflected in cash from financing activities.


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table represents our restricted cash balances as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
which are restricted as a result of lender requirements (in millions):

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost. For newly developed properties, cost includes interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and
construction. Replacements and improvements and capital leases are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally
40 years for buildings and three to ten years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets.

We capitalize certain inventory (such as china, glass, silver, linen) at the time of a hotel opening, or when significant inventory is purchased (in
conjunction with a major rooms renovation or when the number of rooms or meeting space at a hotel is expanded). These amounts are then fully amortized over the estimated useful life of three years. Subsequent replacement purchases are expensed when
placed in service.

We maintain a furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement fund for renewal and replacement capital expenditures at
certain hotels, which is generally funded with approximately 5% of property revenues.

We assess impairment of our real estate properties
based on whether estimated undiscounted future cash flows from each individual property are less than its net book value. If a property is impaired, a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and net book value of the hotel. Based
on this analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of $3 million in 2008 that is included in depreciation expense on the accompanying statement of operations.

We will classify a hotel as held for sale when the sale of the asset is probable, will be completed within one year and actions to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the sale will be withdrawn.
Accordingly, we typically classify assets as held for sale when our Board of Directors has approved the sale, a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash
and no significant financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner. If these criteria are met, we will record an impairment loss if the fair value less costs to sell is lower than the
carrying amount of the hotel and will cease incurring depreciation. We will classify the loss, together with the related operating results, including interest expense on debt assumed by the buyer or that is required to be repaid as a result of the
sale, as discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of operations and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet. Gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of sale or deferred and
recognized as income in subsequent periods as conditions requiring deferral are satisfied or expire without further cost to us.


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We recognize the fair value of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations including
environmental remediation liabilities when incurred, which is generally upon acquisition, construction, or development and/or through the normal operation of the asset, if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value of the
obligation.

Intangible Assets

In conjunction with our acquisition of hotel properties, we may identify intangible assets. Identifiable intangible assets are typically contracts, including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements, which are
recorded at fair value, although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms. Above-market and below-market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant
to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the contract. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line
method over the remaining non-cancelable term of the related agreements.

Minority Interest

The percentage of Host LP owned by third parties, presented as interest of minority partners of Host LP in the consolidated balance sheets, was
$156 million and $188 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We adjust the interest of the minority partners of Host LP each period to maintain a proportional relationship between the book value of equity associated
with our common stockholders relative to that of the unitholders of Host LP since Host LP units may be exchanged into common stock on a one-for-one basis. Net income is allocated to the minority partners of Host LP based on their weighted average
ownership percentage during the period. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $114 million of cash or Host stock, at our option, would be paid to the outside partners of the operating partnership if the partnership were terminated. The
approximate $114 million is equivalent to the 15.1 million partnership units outstanding valued at the December 31, 2008 Host common stock price of $7.57, which we have assumed would be equal to the value provided to outside partners
upon liquidation of the operating partnership.

As of December 31, 2008, we consolidate three majority-owned partnerships with
mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests held by outside partners with finite lives ranging from 99 to 100 years that terminate between 2081 and 2095. Third party partnership interests that have finite lives are included in interest of
minority partners of other consolidated partnerships in the consolidated balance sheets and totaled $24 million and $28 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair values of the
minority interests in these partnerships were approximately $66 million and $139 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, none of our partnerships have infinite lives as defined in SFAS 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

.

Distributions from investments in affiliates

We classify the distributions from our equity investments in the statement of cash flows based upon an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances
of each distribution to determine its nature. For example, distributions from cash generated by property operations are classified as cash flows from operating activities. However, distributions received as a result of property sales would be
classified as cash flows from investing activities.


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Income Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and, as such, are not subject to federal income tax, provided we distribute all of our taxable income annually to our
stockholders and comply with certain other requirements. In addition to paying federal and state income tax on any retained income, we are subject to taxes on “built-in-gains” on sales of certain assets. Additionally, our taxable REIT
subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and foreign income tax. The consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of the taxable REIT subsidiaries, state income taxes incurred
by Host and Host LP and foreign income taxes incurred by Host LP, as well as each of their respective subsidiaries.

Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in
earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals
of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies.

Deferred Charges

Financing costs related to long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest
method.

Foreign Currency Translation

As of December 31, 2008, our foreign operations consist of four properties located in Canada, one property located in Mexico, two in Chile, an investment in a joint venture in Europe and an investment in a joint
venture in Asia. The operations of these properties and our investments are maintained in the local currency and then translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for the period. The assets and liabilities of the properties and the
investment are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Derivative Instruments

We are
subject to market exposures in several aspects of our business including foreign currency exposure related to our investment in the European joint venture, our consolidated international hotels, interest rate exposure for the interest payments for
our variable rate debt and the fair value of our fixed rate debt. We may, from time to time, enter into derivative instruments to either protect against fluctuations in the fair value of our investments in foreign entities or the fair value of our
debt instruments. Prior to entering into the derivative contract, we evaluate whether the transaction would qualify as a fair value hedge and continue to evaluate hedge effectiveness through the life of the contract. Gains and losses on contracts
that meet the requirements for fair value hedge accounting are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with offsetting changes recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately
reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the
impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In situations where we have variable debt, we may purchase interest rate swaps or interest rate caps,
which would be considered derivative instruments. If the requirements for hedge accounting are met and the instruments qualify as cash flow hedges, amounts paid or received under these agreements would be recognized over the life of the agreements
as adjustments to interest expense, and the fair value of the derivatives would be recorded on the accompanying balance sheet, with offsetting adjustments or charges recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.

Other Comprehensive Income

The
components of total accumulated other comprehensive income in the balance sheet are as follows (in millions):

Revenues

Our consolidated results of operations reflect revenues and expenses of our hotels. Revenues are recognized when the services are provided. Additionally, we collect sales, use, occupancy and similar taxes at our
hotels which we present on a net basis (excluded from revenues) on our statements of operations.


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders as adjusted for potentially dilutive securities, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus other
potentially dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans, other minority interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interests to common OP units and convertible debt
securities. No effect is shown for any securities that are anti-dilutive.

(2)

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased $100 million of our $500 million 3


/


% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (the “2004 Debentures”) for approximately $82 million. Under FASB’s
Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-53, “

Computation of Earnings per Share for a Period that Includes a Redemption or an Induced Conversion of a Portion of a Class of Preferred Stock”

(EITF D-53) we are required to determine the
dilutive effect of the repurchased 2004 Exchangeable Debentures separately from the 2004 Exchangeable Debentures outstanding at December 31, 2008. 2004 Exchangeable Debentures repurchased during 2008 are treated as having been converted to
common stock equivalents at the start of the period. Accordingly, the 2008 adjustment to net income related to the 2004 Debentures consists of an add back of $19 million of interest expense netted with the deduction of the approximate $18
million gain, for a net effect of $1 million.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

At December 31, 2008, we maintained two stock-based employee compensation plans, which are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123R
“Accounting for Stock Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123R”). See Note 8, Employee Stock Plans.


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. We are
exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions, access to our credit facility, the amounts due and services performed by our managers and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts. Our credit risk
exposure with regard to our cash and the $400 million available under our credit facility is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions. Amounts due from the managers of our hotels generally reflect the
operations of the hotel in the immediately preceding period and the working capital at the hotels. These amounts totaled $65 million as of December 31, 2008 and we consider the risk that our managers will fail to meet the payment
obligations to be remote. Currently, our exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totals $6 million and the counterparties are investment grade financial institutions.

Application of New Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007),

Business Combinations,

(“FAS 141R”). FAS 141R provides principles on the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,
any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination. The standard particularly requires the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests to be measured at the acquisition date fair value,
including contingent considerations. Furthermore, FAS 141R prohibits acquisition-related costs, such as due diligence, legal and accounting fees, from being applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets. We will adopt the provisions
of this statement beginning in the first quarter of 2009 prospectively. We do not believe the adoption of this statement will materially affect the recognition and measurement related to our future business combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51,

(“FAS 160”), which defines a noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary as “the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent” and requires noncontrolling
interest to be presented as a separate component of equity in the consolidated balance sheet. FAS 160 also modifies the presentation of net income by requiring earnings and other comprehensive income to be attributed to controlling and
noncontrolling interests. We will adopt this standard beginning in the first quarter of 2009 prospectively and any presentation and disclosure requirements retrospectively. Upon the adoption of this standard, we will reclassify interests of our
minority partners of other consolidated partnerships from the mezzanine level of the balance sheet to stockholders’ equity. Interest of minority partners of Host L.P. will continue to be classified in the minority interest section of our
balance sheet, as the OP Units do not meet the requirements for equity classification per EITF topic D-98. As of December 31, 2008, the balance to be reclassified totaled $24 million. Additionally, the income attributable to minority
partners of Host L.P. and other consolidated partnerships will no longer be deducted in our determination of net income and net income would have increased by $21 million, $32 million and $41 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. However, the income attributable to minority partners will be deducted in our determination of net income available to common shareholders. Therefore, we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect
on our income available to common shareholders or our diluted earnings per share.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB staff position (FSP)
APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)” (“FSP 14-1”). FSP 14-1 specifies that issuers of such instruments should
separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the instrument’s issuance date when interest cost is recognized. Our 2007 Debentures and our 2004
Debentures are


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

within the scope of FSP 14-1; therefore, we will be required to record the debt components of the debentures at fair value as of the date of issuance
and amortize the discount as an increase to interest expense over the expected life of the debt. The implementation of this standard will result in a decrease to net income and earnings per share for all periods presented; however, there is no
effect on our cash interest payments. FSP 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years and shall be applied retrospectively to all periods
presented. Early adoption of FSP 14-1 is not permitted. As a result of the application of this standard, our diluted earnings per common share are estimated to decrease by approximately $.04 to $.05 per share. Additionally, the application of this
standard will decrease our debt balance as of December 31, 2008 by approximately $77 million, with a corresponding increase to stockholders’ equity.

Certain prior year financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform
with the current year presentation.

Investments in Affiliates

We own investments in
voting interest entities which we do not consolidate and, accordingly, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The debt of these affiliates is non-recourse to, and not guaranteed by, us. Investments in affiliates consists of the
following:

European Joint Venture

In March 2006, we formed a joint venture, HHR Euro CV, to acquire hotels in Europe (the “European joint venture”). We serve as the
general partner for the European joint venture and have a 32.1% ownership interest (including our limited and general partner interests). The initial term of the European joint venture is ten years subject to two one-year extensions with
partner approval. HHR Euro CV has leased six of its hotels to HHR TRS CV, where we also serve as a general partner and have a 9.8% ownership interest including our general and limited partner interests. Due to the ownership structure and the
non-Host limited partners’ rights to cause the dissolution and liquidation of the European joint venture and HHR TRS CV at any time, they are not consolidated in our financial statements. As general partner, we earn a management fee based on
the amount of equity commitments and equity investments. In 2008 and 2007, we recorded approximately $6 million and $5 million, respectively, of management fees.

During 2008, we entered into three foreign currency forward purchase contracts totaling €60 million (approximately $88 million) to hedge a
portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the European joint venture. These derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign
operation, and, in accordance with SFAS 133, are


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the stockholders’ equity portion of our balance
sheet. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps. During 2008, we recorded an increase in the fair value of the derivative instruments totaling approximately $6 million, which is equal to the
fair value as of December 31, 2008 included in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Our unconsolidated investees assess impairment
of real estate properties based on whether estimated undiscounted future cash flows from each individual property are less than book value. If a property is impaired, a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and net book value of
the hotel. In 2008, we recognized a charge of approximately $2 million related to the impairment of one property in our European joint venture as a component of equity in earnings of affiliates. In addition, we assess impairment of our
non-consolidated investments for other than temporary declines in the value of the investment, based on guidance from APB Opinion No. 18. We did not record any other impairments on our investments in 2008.

Asian Joint Venture

On
March 25, 2008, we entered into a joint venture, structured as a Singapore Corporation, with RECO Hotels JV Private Limited, an affiliate of GIC RE. The joint venture will explore investment opportunities in various markets throughout Asia,
including China, Japan, Vietnam, and India as well as Australia. We own a 25% interest in the joint venture. The initial term of the Asian joint venture is for a period of seven years. Due to the ownership structure of the Asian joint venture and
our partner’s rights to cause the dissolution and liquidation of the joint venture, it is not consolidated in our financial statements. As of December 31, 2008, the Asian joint venture did not own any hotels.

CBM Joint Venture LP

CBM Joint
Venture Limited Partnership owns 115 Courtyard by Marriott hotels, which are operated by Marriott International pursuant to long-term management agreements. On March 29, 2005, we sold 85% of our interest in CBM Joint Venture LLC for
approximately $92 million and recorded a gain on the sale, net of taxes, of approximately $41 million. In conjunction with the sale of our interest, CBM Joint Venture LLC was recapitalized and converted into a limited partnership, CBM
Joint Venture Limited Partnership with Marriott International and affiliates of Sarofim Realty Advisors. Post-recapitalization, we own a 3.6% limited partner interest. We have the right to cause CBM Joint Venture LP to redeem our remaining interest,
under certain conditions, prior to December 2009. Thereafter, the general partner of CBM Joint Venture LP has the right to redeem our remaining interest.

Other Investments

We have a 49% limited partner interest in Tiburon Golf Ventures, L.P., which owns
the golf club surrounding The Ritz-Carlton, Naples Golf Resort. We also own minority interests in three partnerships that directly or indirectly own two hotels. The total carrying value of these partnerships is less than $500,000, and we do not have
any guarantees or commitments in relation to these partnerships.

Senior Notes

General.

Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host LP’s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all
subordinated obligations of Host LP. The face amount of our outstanding senior notes as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. The outstanding senior notes balance as of December 31, 2008
and 2007 includes discounts of approximately $13 million and $18 million, respectively. The notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are secured by pledges of equity
interests in many of our subsidiaries. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture, as well as our credit facility, certain other senior debt, and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging
agreements, if any, with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above.

We had the following activities during 2008 and 2007:

•

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased $100 million of our $500 million 3

preferred stock under the senior notes indenture when our EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is above 1.7 to 1.0. This ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal
quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. For example, under the terms of our senior notes indenture interest expense excludes items such as the
gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair
value, and, in 2009, approximately $30 million of interest expense to be recorded as a result of the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 relating to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements
of operations. Other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate values) excluding Intangible assets and
secured indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets. So long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, we may pay preferred or common dividends and incur
additional debt under the senior notes indenture, including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition. In addition, even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and pay dividends, we are still permitted to incur
certain types of debt, including (i) credit facility debt, (ii) refinancing debt, (iii) up to $300 million of mortgage debt whose proceeds would be used to repay debt under credit facility (and permanently reduce our ability to borrow
under the credit facility by such amount), and (iv) up to $100 million of other debt. Our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters, such as our ability to pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our equity interests;
make investments; permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries; sell assets; guarantee indebtedness; enter into transactions with affiliates; create certain liens; and sell certain assets or merge with or into other
companies. Our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets (as defined in the indenture as undepreciated property value) of not less than 125% of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not
secured by mortgages. This coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or pay dividends discussed above (whose consequences, where we fall below the coverage level, are
limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or pay dividends, but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture). As of December 31, 2008, we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under our
senior notes indentures.

2007 Exchangeable Senior Debentures.

The 2007 Debentures mature on April 15,
2027 and are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year beginning on July 15, 2007. Holders have the
right to require us to repurchase the 2007 Debentures on April 15, 2012, April 15, 2017 and April 15, 2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders may exchange their 2007 Debentures prior to
maturity under certain conditions, including when the closing sale price of Host’s common stock is more than 130% of the exchange price per share for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days
prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption. On exchange, we must deliver cash in an amount equal to not less than the lower of the exchange value (which is the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the average price
of our common shares) and the aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Debentures to be exchanged, and, at our option, shares, cash or a combination thereof for any excess above the principal value. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, the 2007
Debentures at any time on or after April 20, 2012 upon 15 days notice at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. If we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we
would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures at the exchange value described above rather than receive the cash redemption price. The current exchange rate is 31.35 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures,


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

which is equivalent to an exchange price of $31.90 per share of Host common stock. The exchange rate may be adjusted under certain circumstances including
the payment of common dividends exceeding $.20 per share in any given quarter.

2004 Exchangeable Senior
Debentures.

On March 16, 2004, Host LP issued $500 million, 3.25% 2004 Debentures and received net proceeds of $484 million, after discounts, underwriting fees and expenses. During 2008, we repurchased $100
million of the 2004 Debentures for approximately $82 million and recorded a gain on repurchase of approximately $18 million. The outstanding 2004 Debentures mature on April 15, 2024 and are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior
notes. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase the 2004 Debentures on April 15,
2010, April 15, 2014 and April 15, 2019 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount. Holders may exchange their 2004 Debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions, including at any time at which the closing sale price of
our common stock is more than 120% of the exchange price per share, for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption. The
current exchange rate is 63.3687 shares for each $1,000 of principal amount of the 2004 Debentures, or a total of approximately 25 million shares (which is equivalent to an exchange price of $15.78 per share). The exchange rate is adjusted
for certain circumstances, including the payment of common dividends. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, the 2004 Debentures at any time subsequent to April 19, 2009 upon 30 days notice at the applicable redemption price as set forth in
the indenture. If we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures for stock rather than receive the cash redemption price.

Credit Facility.

On May 25, 2007, we entered into a second amended and restated bank credit facility with Deutsche
Bank AG New York Branch, as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Citicorp North America Inc., Société Générale and Calyon New York Branch, as Co-Documentation Agents and certain other agents
and lenders. The credit facility provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of $600 million. During any period in which our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the
aggregate outstanding principal amount under the credit facility to exceed $300 million. The credit facility also includes subcommitments for (i) the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of $10 million and
(ii) loans in certain foreign currencies in an aggregate amount of $300 million, (A) $150 million of which may be loaned to certain of our Canadian subsidiaries in Canadian Dollars and (B) $300 million of which may be
loaned to us in Pounds Sterling and Euros. The credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of September 2011. We have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met as of September 2011. These conditions
include the payment of a fee to the lenders, that no default or event of default exists and maintaining a leverage ratio below 6.75x . Subject to certain conditions, we also have the option to increase the amount of the facility by up to
$190 million to the extent that any one or more lenders, whether or not currently party to the credit facility, commits to be a lender for such amount.

In the second quarter of 2008, we entered into a $210 million term loan under the credit facility. The term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points, with a LIBOR floor of 2.25% for an all-in rate of 4.0% at
December 31, 2008. We also have the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points and the Prime Lending Rate, plus, in both cases, the applicable spread of 75 basis points. In September
2008, we also borrowed $200 million under the revolver portion of our credit facility at a rate of LIBOR plus 65 basis points based on our current leverage. Based on our current leverage, we have $400 million of remaining available capacity under
the revolver portion of our credit facility.


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and
are currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The pledges are permitted to be released in the event that certain conditions are satisfied, including the requirement that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for two
consecutive fiscal quarters. As a result of having satisfied such conditions, currently we are not required to pledge our equity interests in any newly acquired or formed subsidiary, and at our election, we may obtain a release of all existing
pledges for so long as our leverage ratio continues to be below 6.0x. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility, as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture and interest rate swap agreements and other
hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility.

Financial Covenants.

The credit
facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. Prior to the end of our third quarter of 2009, we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit
facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 7.5x and our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x. Thereafter, the maximum leverage ratio under the credit facility is reduced to 7.25x, with the minimum unsecured coverage ratio
continuing to be set at 1.75x. In all cases, if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the credit facility to exceed $300 million.
However, to the extent our borrowings under the credit facility revolver exceed $300 million on the date that our leverage ratio exceeds 7.0x, we are not required to repay the excess for one year. The financial covenants for the credit facility do
not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility. Hence, so long as there are no amounts outstanding, we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit
facility in the future if we were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants. These calculations are performed in accordance with our credit facility based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters giving effect to
transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. For example, under the terms of the credit facility interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment
of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value, and, in 2009, approximately $30
million of interest expense to be recorded as a result of the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 relating to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt
used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a “net debt” concept under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million is deducted from our total debt balance. As of December 31, 2008, our leverage ratio was
4.1x versus the 7.5x maximum leverage ratio allowed under the credit facility, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.8x versus the 1.0x minimum fixed charge coverage ratio allowed under the credit facility and our unsecured interest coverage ratio
was 4.1x versus the minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of 1.75x allowed under the credit facility. Accordingly, we are in compliance with these and all of our other financial covenants under the credit facility as of December 31, 2008.

Interest and Fees.

We pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates plus a
margin that is set with reference to our leverage ratio. In the case of LIBOR borrowings in US Dollars, as well as Euros and Pounds Sterling denominated borrowings, the rate of interest ranges from 65 basis points to 150 basis points over LIBOR. We
also have the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points and the Prime Lending Rate, plus, in both cases, the applicable spread ranging from 0 to 50 basis points. Based on our current leverage
ratio of 4.1x, we can borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 70 basis points or Prime plus 0 basis points. To the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment of
10 to 15 basis points, depending on our average revolver usage during the applicable period.


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Other Covenants.

The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on
customary matters. Certain covenants become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x. In particular, at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures, and
the limitations on acquisitions, investments and dividends contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture. Additionally, the credit facility’s
restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends are generally consistent with our senior notes indenture. These provisions, under certain circumstances, limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in
connection with a refinancing, and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain our tax status as a REIT.

Mortgage Debt

All of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except for environmental liabilities, fraud, misapplication of funds and
other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2008, we have 14 assets that are secured by mortgage debt with an average interest rate of 6.2% that mature between 2009 and 2023. As of December 31, 2008, we are in compliance with
the covenants under our mortgage debt obligations.

We had the following mortgage debt issuances and repayments for 2008 and 2007. Interest
for our mortgage debt is payable on a monthly basis:

(1)

The Orlando World Center Marriott mortgage loan has a floating rate of interest of LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The interest rate shown reflects the rate in effect as of
December 31, 2008. Additionally, we have the right to extend the maturity for two, one-year periods, subject to certain conditions.

(2)

The JW Marriott, Washington, D.C. mortgage debt had a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 210 basis points. The interest rate shown reflects the rate as of the date of the
transaction.

Derivative Instruments

We purchased an interest rate cap which expired in September 2007 in connection with the mortgage debt secured by the JW Marriott, Washington, D.C. The mortgage debt was repaid in September 2007 and the impact of
changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap was immaterial for all periods presented. As of December 31,


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

2008 we have no outstanding interest rate swap or cap agreements. Additionally, during 2008 we entered into three foreign currency forward purchase contracts
to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure relating to our investment in the European joint venture. See Note 3 “Investments in Affiliates”.

Aggregate Debt Maturities

Aggregate debt maturities at December 31, 2008 are as follows (in
millions):

(1)

The debt maturing in 2011 includes $410 million related to borrowings under the credit facility, which can be extended, at our option, for one year if our leverage ratio is below
6.75x and certain other conditions are met. Similarly, the $300 million mortgage loan on the Orlando World Center Marriott, which also matures in 2011, can be extended for two one-year periods, subject to achieving a certain debt coverage ratio and
other conditions.

Interest

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we made cash interest payments of $360 million, $419 million and $459 million, respectively, which includes capitalized interest of $10 million, $10 million and
$5 million, respectively, related to qualifying property construction activities. During 2008, we recorded a gain of approximately $18 million associated with the repurchase of a portion of our 2004 Debentures that is included in interest
expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Our 2007 and 2006 interest expense includes losses of $45 million and $17 million, respectively, on the early extinguishment of debt, which includes prepayment premiums, the acceleration of the
related discounts and deferred financing costs and the termination of related interest rate swap agreements. Deferred financing costs amounted to $47 million and $51 million, net of accumulated amortization, as of December 31, 2008
and 2007, respectively. Amortization of deferred financing costs totaled $12 million, $13 million and $15 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is included in interest expense on the accompanying statements of operations.

Amortization of property and equipment under capital leases totaled $2 million for each of 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is
included in depreciation and amortization on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Stockholders’ Equity

Seven hundred fifty
million shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share, are authorized, of which 525.3 million and 522.6 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Fifty million shares of no par value
preferred stock are authorized, with 4.0 million shares outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Dividends

We are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income, excluding net capital gain, to qualify as a REIT. However, our policy on common dividends is generally to distribute 100% of our estimated
annual taxable income, including net capital gains, unless otherwise contractually restricted. The amount of any dividends will be determined by Host’s Board of Directors. For our preferred dividends, we will generally pay the quarterly
dividend, regardless of the amount of taxable income, unless similarly contractually restricted. All dividends declared in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were determined to be ordinary income.

Stock Repurchase

The Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of common stock and equity related securities. These
securities may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions, depending on market conditions. The plan does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number or amount of securities and may be suspended at any time at
management’s discretion. As of December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 6.5 million shares valued at approximately $100 million. The shares repurchased constitute authorized but unissued shares. Additionally, as part of this
program during the fourth quarter we repurchased $100 million of our 2004 Debentures for $82 million. See Note 4 – Debt for further discussion. As a result of these purchases, we currently have approximately $318 million left under the
Board of Directors’ authorization for future repurchases.

Preferred Stock

We currently have one class of publicly-traded preferred stock outstanding: 4,034,400 shares of 8


/


% Class E preferred stock. Holders of the
preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at 8


/


% per annum of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference, which are payable quarterly in arrears. After June 2, 2009, we have the option to redeem the Class E preferred stock for $25.00 per share, plus
accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of redemption. The preferred stock ranks senior to the common stock. The preferred stockholders generally have no voting rights. Accrued preferred dividends at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were
approximately $2 million.

During 2006, we redeemed, at par, all of our then outstanding shares of Class C cumulative preferred stock.
The fair value of the preferred stock (which was equal to the redemption price) exceeded the carrying value of the Class C preferred stock by approximately $6 million. This amount represents the original issuance cost. The original issuance
cost for the Class C preferred stock has been reflected in the determination of net income available to common stockholders for the purpose of calculating our basic and diluted earnings per share in the respective years of redemption.

6.

Income Taxes

We elected to be taxed as a REIT
effective January 1, 1999, pursuant to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In general, a corporation that elects REIT status and meets certain tax law requirements regarding the distribution of its taxable income to its
stockholders as prescribed by applicable tax laws and


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

complies with certain other requirements (relating primarily to the nature of its assets and the sources of its revenues) is generally not subject to federal
and state income taxation on its operating income distributed to its stockholders. In addition to paying federal and state income taxes on any retained income, we are subject to taxes on “built-in-gains” resulting from sales of certain
assets. Additionally, our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and foreign income tax. The consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of the taxable REIT
subsidiaries, state income taxes incurred by Host and Host LP and foreign income taxes incurred by Host LP, as well as each of their respective subsidiaries.

Where required, deferred income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases of
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. However, deferred tax assets are
recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax
planning strategies.

Total deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows (in millions):

We have recorded a 100% valuation allowance of approximately $28 million against the deferred
tax asset for our Mexican net operating loss and asset tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2008. The net increase in the valuation allowance for the years ending December 31, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $3 million in each year.
There is no valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for our Canadian net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2008. The reduction in the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset for our
Canadian net operating loss carryforward of approximately $3 million was recorded as a reduction of income tax expense in 2008. We expect all net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes to be realized. The
primary components of our net deferred tax asset was as follows (in millions):


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

At December 31, 2008, we have aggregate gross domestic and foreign net operating loss, capital
loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $140 million. We have deferred tax assets related to these loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $56 million with a valuation allowance of approximately $28 million. Our
net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2010 through 2027, and our foreign capital loss carryforwards have no expiration period. Our domestic tax credits have no expiration period and our foreign asset tax credits expire through 2017.

The differences between the
income tax (benefit) provision calculated at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% and the actual income tax (benefit) provision recorded each year for continuing operations are as follows (in millions):

In 2006, we recognized an income tax benefit of $5 million relating to the reduction of previously
accrued income taxes after an evaluation of the exposure items and the expiration of related statutes of limitation. No such amount was recognized in 2007 or 2008. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, was $7 million for each of
2008, 2007 and 2006.


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return. We must determine whether
it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position
meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial
statements. FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized a reduction of our liability for
unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $11 million. This reduction was accounted for as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2007. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax
benefits is as follows (in millions):



Balance at January 1, 2008

$


$


Additions based on tax positions related to the current year



Balance at December 31, 2008

$

All of such amount, if recognized, would impact our reconciliation between the income tax
provision (benefit) calculated at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% and the actual income tax provision (benefit) recorded each year.

It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly decrease within 12 months of the reporting date due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation. An estimate of the range of such
possible decrease is $3 million to $7 million. As of December 31, 2008, the tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions generally include 2005-2008.

We recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. During the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recognized approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million of interest, respectively. Interest recognized in 2008 was immaterial. We had approximately $0.4 million and $0.6 million for the payment
of interest accrued at December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Leases

Hotel Leases

We lease substantially all of our hotels (the “Leases”) to a wholly owned subsidiary that qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary due to federal
income tax restrictions on a REIT’s ability to derive revenue directly from the operation and management of a hotel.

Hospitality
Properties Trust Relationship

In a series of related transactions in 1995 and 1996, we sold and leased back 53 Courtyard by Marriott
(“Courtyard”) properties and 18 Residence Inn by Marriott (“Residence Inn”) properties to Hospitality Properties Trust (“HPT”). These leases, which are accounted for as operating leases and are included in the table
below, have initial terms expiring between 2010 and 2012 and are renewable at our option. Minimum rent payments are $58 million annually for the Courtyard properties and $19 million annually for the Residence Inn properties, and additional
rent based upon sales levels are payable to HPT under the terms of the leases. During 2008, we gave


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

notice that we will not renew the lease on the 18 Residence Inn properties and therefore that lease, as well as the related sublease described below, will
terminate in December 2010, and we expect HPT to return the approximate $17 million security deposit.

In 1998, we sublet the HPT
properties (the “Subleases”) to separate sublessee subsidiaries of Barceló Crestline Corporation (the “Sublessee”), subject to the terms of the applicable HPT lease. The term of each Sublease expires simultaneously with
the expiration of the initial term of the HPT lease to which it relates and automatically renews for the corresponding renewal term under the HPT lease, unless either we or the Sublessee elect not to renew the Sublease provided, however, that
neither party can elect to terminate fewer than all of the Subleases in a particular pool of HPT properties (one for the Courtyard properties and one for the Residence Inn properties). Rent payable by the Sublessee under the Subleases consists of
the minimum rent payable under the HPT lease and an additional percentage rent payable to us. The percentage rent payable by the Sublessee is generally sufficient to cover the additional rent due under the HPT lease, with any excess being retained
by us. The rent payable under the Subleases is guaranteed by the Sublessee, up to a maximum amount of $30 million, which is allocated between the two pools of HPT properties.

Other Lease Information

As of
December 31, 2008, all or a portion of 35 of our hotels are subject to ground leases, generally with multiple renewal options, all of which are accounted for as operating leases. For lease agreements with scheduled rent increases, we recognize
the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of these leases contain provisions for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts. We also have leases on facilities
used in our former restaurant business, some of which we subsequently subleased. These leases and subleases contain one or more renewal options, generally for five or ten-year periods. The restaurant leases are accounted for as operating leases. Our
lease activities also include leases entered into by our hotels for various types of equipment, such as computer equipment, vehicles and telephone systems. Equipment leases are accounted for as either operating or capital leases depending on the
characteristics of the particular lease arrangement. Equipment leases that are characterized as capital leases are classified as furniture and equipment and are depreciated over the life of the lease. The amortization charge applicable to
capitalized leases is included in depreciation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

The following table
presents the future minimum annual rental commitments required under non-cancelable leases for which we are the lessee as of December 31, 2008. Minimum payments for the operating leases have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease
rentals from restaurants and the Sublessee of approximately $9 million and $275 million, respectively, payable to us under non-cancelable subleases.

We remain contingently liable on certain leases relating to our former restaurant business. Such
contingent liabilities aggregated $23 million as of December 31, 2008. However, management considers the likelihood of any material funding related to these leases to be remote.

Employee Stock Plans

We maintain two stock-based
compensation plans, the comprehensive stock plan (the “Comprehensive Plan”), whereby we may award to participating employees (i) restricted shares of our common stock, (ii) options to purchase our common stock and
(iii) deferred shares of our common stock and the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), which are accounted for under SFAS 123R. At December 31, 2008, there were approximately 4.0 million shares of common stock reserved and available
for issuance under the Comprehensive Plan.

We recognize costs resulting from our share-based payment transactions in our financial
statements over their vesting periods. We classify share-based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity classified awards or liability classified awards. The classification of our restricted stock awards as either an
equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options. Equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. Liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. The value of
all restricted stock awards, less estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award—the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation
cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service. All restricted stock awards to senior executives outstanding as of December 31, 2008 have been classified as liability awards, primarily due to settlement
features that allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax requirements in excess of the statutory minimum withholding. Restricted stock awards to our upper-middle management have been classified as
equity awards as these awards do not have this optional tax withholding feature.

Restricted Stock

During the first quarter of 2006, we granted shares to senior executives that vested through year end 2008 in three annual installments (the “2006
– 2008 Plan”). Vesting for these shares was determined both on continued employment and market performance based on the achievement of total shareholder return on an absolute and relative basis. For the shares that vested solely on
continued employment, we recognized compensation expense over the requisite period based on the market price at the balance sheet date. For liability classified share awards that vested based on market performance, we recognized compensation expense
over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the awards at the balance sheet date. At year end 2008, compensation expense for the shares that were earned is based on the market price at the balance sheet date. No compensation expense
is recognized for shares that were not earned.

We made an additional grant of shares to senior executives in February 2006 (“2006
supplemental grant”). Twenty-five percent of this award vested immediately and was expensed on the date of grant, while the


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

remaining 75% vests over a three-year period that began in February 2006 based on continued employment. We recognize compensation expense for the outstanding
portion of this grant based on the market price at the balance sheet date.

Effective January 1, 2008, we made additional grants to
nine senior executives of approximately 200,000 shares. Vesting for these shares was based on continued employment through December 31, 2008. We recognized compensation expense for these shares based on the market price at the balance sheet
date.

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recorded compensation expense of approximately $2 million, $3 million and $32 million
respectively, related to the restricted stock awards to senior executives. The majority of these awards vested on December 31, 2008. The total unrecognized compensation cost, based on the valuation criteria above, that relates to nonvested
restricted stock awards at December 31, 2008 was approximately $.2 million and primarily reflects shares issued under our 2006 supplemental grant that vested in February 2009. The following table is a summary of the status of our senior
executive plans for the three years ended December 31, 2008. The fair values for the awards below are based on the fair value at the respective transaction dates, as the awards are classified as liability awards.

(1)

Shares that vest at December 31 of each year are issued to the employees in the first quarter of the following year, although the requisite service period is complete.
Accordingly, the 0.1 million shares issued in 2008 include shares vested at December 31, 2007, after adjusting for shares withheld to meet employee tax requirements. The withheld shares for employee tax requirements were valued at
$1.6 million, $13.3 million and $11.7 million, for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(2)

Based on our historical forfeiture rates, we expect that substantially all shares that meet the required market condition will vest.

We also maintain a restricted stock program for our upper-middle management. Vesting for these shares is determined based on continued employment and,
accordingly, we recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of three years. We recorded compensation expense related to these shares of $1.1 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million during 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, all compensation cost for the upper-middle management program has been recognized. The following table is a summary of the status of our upper-middle management plan for the three years ended
December 31, 2008. The fair values for the awards below are based on the fair value at the grant date of the respective awards, as the awards are classified as equity awards.

Shares that vest at December 31 of each year are issued to the employees in the first quarter of the following year, although the requisite service period is complete.
Accordingly, the 41,000 shares issued in 2008 include the shares vested at December 31, 2007, after adjusting for shares withheld to meet employee tax requirements. The value of shares withheld for employee tax requirements was not material for
all periods presented.

Based on our historical forfeiture rates, we expect that substantially all shares will vest.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under
the terms of the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”), eligible employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at 90% of the lower of market value at the beginning or end of the plan period and is therefore compensatory
under SFAS 123R. Effective January 1, 2008, we updated the plan so that shares vested on a calendar quarter basis and employees made their purchase options on a quarterly basis. Prior to 2008, the shares vested on an annual basis. We record
compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan based on the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights, which is estimated using an option-priced model. The compensation expense reflected in net income was not material for all
periods presented.

Employee Stock Options

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted the expense recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for employee stock options granted on or after January 1, 2002 only. We did not grant any stock options between December
2002 and December 31, 2008. All options granted are fully vested and exercisable as of December 31, 2006. The fair value of the 2002 stock options was estimated on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. Compensation expense for
the stock options was recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The weighted average fair value per option granted during 2002 was $1.41. We did not record any compensation expense related to these shares in 2007 or 2008, as all
shares were fully vested at December 31, 2006. We recorded compensation expense of approximately $229,000 for 2006, which represents the expense for stock options granted during 2002. The aggregate intrinsic value of the outstanding and
exercisable options at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $0 million and $3.5 million, respectively.

The following table is a summary of the status of our stock option plans that have been approved by
our stockholders for the three years ended December 31, 2008. We do not have stock option plans that have not been approved by our stockholders.

The following table summarizes information about stock options at December 31, 2008:

In connection with the Host Marriott Services (“HM Services”) spin-off in 1995,
outstanding options held by our current and former employees were redenominated in both our and HM Services stock and the exercise prices of the options were adjusted based on the relative trading prices of shares of the common stock of the two
companies. Pursuant to the distribution agreement between us and HM Services, we originally had the right to receive up to 1.4 million shares of HM Services’ common stock or an equivalent cash value subsequent to exercise of the options
held by certain former and current employees of Marriott International. However, in 1999, HM Services was no longer publicly traded (and was renamed HMS Host) and, as a result, all future payments to us were to be made in cash. As of
December 31, 2007, the receivable balance was approximately $0.5 million, which is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All options that were not exercised expired in 2008.

Deferred Stock

Deferred stock
incentive plan shares granted to officers and key employees after 1990 generally vest over 10 years in annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant. Certain employees may elect to defer payments until termination or retirement. We
accrue compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, less estimated forfeitures. No shares have been granted under this plan since 2003. The compensation cost that
has been charged against income for deferred stock was not material for all periods presented.

Profit Sharing and Postemployment Benefit Plans

We
contribute to defined contribution plans for the benefit of employees meeting certain eligibility requirements and electing participation in the plans. The discretionary amount to be matched by us is determined annually by the Board of Directors. We
provide medical benefits to a limited number of retired employees meeting restrictive eligibility requirements. Our recorded liability for this obligation is not material. Payments for these items were not material for the three years ended
December 31, 2008.

Discontinued Operations

Dispositions

We disposed of two hotels in 2008, nine hotels in 2007 and seven hotels in 2006. The following table summarizes the revenues, income
before taxes, and the gain on dispositions, net of tax, of the hotels which have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (in millions):

Subsequent to year end, we sold the Hyatt Regency Boston for net proceeds of $113 million, which
included the return of reserves held by the manager. The hotel was not considered held-for-sale at year end 2008, and we will record a gain of approximately $20 million in the first quarter of 2009.

Gain on Insurance Settlement

Eight of our
properties sustained damage from hurricanes during 2005, with two, the New Orleans Marriott and the Fort Lauderdale Marina Marriott, having extensive damage which required us to temporarily close all or part of these hotels. Our insurance coverage
for the properties entitles us to receive recoveries for damage to the hotels, as well as payments for business interruption. Gains on property insurance proceeds represent proceeds received in excess of the insurance receivable, which represents
the book value of the damaged assets that were written-off. All gains resulting from insurance proceeds are not recognized until all contingencies are resolved. The following chart details the damages incurred, proceeds received and gains recorded
as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 due to hurricanes Katrina and Wilma (in millions):

Acquisitions

Starwood Acquisition

On April 10, 2006, we acquired 25 domestic hotels and three foreign hotels from Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide,
Inc., or Starwood for total consideration of approximately $3.1 billion. The acquisition was completed pursuant to the Master Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 14, 2005, and amended as of March 24, 2006, (the “Master
Agreement”) among Host, Starwood and certain of their respective subsidiaries.

Our summarized unaudited consolidated pro forma
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006, assuming the Starwood acquisition occurred on January 1, 2006, are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

quoted market prices. The fair values of financial instruments not included in this table are estimated to be equal to their carrying amounts.

Relationship with Marriott International

We have
entered into various agreements with Marriott, including the management of approximately 60% of our hotels, as well as franchised properties; financing for joint ventures or partnerships including the acquisition in 1996 of two hotels (one of which
was sold on January 30, 2004) in Mexico City, Mexico and the 2000 acquisition of CBM Joint Venture LLC (see Note 3) and certain limited administrative services.

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, we paid Marriott $178 million, $197 million and $165 million, respectively, in hotel management fees and approximately $1 million, in franchise fees for each of 2008, 2007
and 2006. Included in the management fees paid are amounts paid to The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, LLC (Ritz-Carlton), Courtyard Management Corporation and Residence Inn Management Corporation.

We negotiated amendments to various management agreements with Marriott and agreed, among other matters, to waive performance termination tests through
the end of fiscal year 2009, to modify certain extension tests which condition the manager’s ability to renew the management agreements, and to extend certain contracts for ten additional years. As part of this negotiation, Marriott agreed to
make cash payments to us, over time, to reduce an existing cap on the costs and expenses related to chain services that are provided on a centralized basis, as well as to establish a cap on certain other costs, to provide us with an incentive to
increase our capital expenditures at the hotels through 2008, to waive certain deferred management fees, and to modify the incentive management fee on certain contracts. In addition, we agreed to use a portion of Marriott’s cash payments for
brand reinvestment projects at various hotels in our portfolio.

15.

Hotel Management Agreements and Operating and License Agreements

Our hotels are subject to management agreements under which various operators, including Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt, Swissôtel, Hilton, Four Seasons, Fairmont and Starwood, operate our hotels for the payment
of a management fee. The agreements generally provide for both base and incentive management fees based on hotel sales and operating profit, respectively. As part of the management agreements, the manager furnishes the hotels


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

with certain chain services which are generally provided on a central or regional basis to all hotels in the manager’s hotel system. Chain services
include central training, advertising and promotion, national reservation systems, computerized payroll and accounting services, and such additional services as needed which may be more efficiently performed on a centralized basis. Costs and
expenses incurred in providing such services are allocated among the hotels managed, owned or leased by the manager on a fair and equitable basis. In addition, our managers will generally have a guest rewards program which will be charged to all of
the hotels that participate in the program.

We are obligated to provide the manager with sufficient funds, generally 5% of revenue
generated at the hotel, to cover the cost of (a) certain non-routine repairs and maintenance to the hotels which are normally capitalized; and (b) replacements and renewals to the hotels’ furniture, fixtures and equipment. Under
certain circumstances, we will be required to establish escrow accounts for such purposes under terms outlined in the agreements.

Marriott International

Of our hotels, 68 are subject to management agreements under which Marriott or one of their
subsidiaries manages the hotels, generally for an initial term of 15 to 20 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of Marriott. Marriott typically receives a base fee of three percent of gross revenues and incentive management fees
generally equal to 20% operating profit after we have received a priority return. We have the option to terminate certain management agreements if specified performance or extension thresholds are not satisfied. A single agreement may be canceled
under certain conditions, although such cancellation will not trigger the cancellation of any other agreement.

Additionally, while most of
our management agreements are not terminable prior to their full term we have negotiated rights with respect to 21 specified Marriott-branded hotels to terminate management agreements in connection with the sale of these hotels subject to certain
limitations, including the number of agreements that can be terminated per year, limitations measured by EBITDA, and limitations requiring that a significant part of such hotels maintain the Marriott brand affiliation. The described termination
rights may be exercised without payment of a termination fee except for one of the specified hotels wherein a termination fee is required if it does not maintain the Marriott brand affiliation.

We have a franchise agreement with Marriott for one hotel. Pursuant to the franchise agreement, we pay a franchise fee based on a percentage of room
sales and food and beverage sales, as well as certain other fees for advertising and reservations. Franchise fees for room sales are approximately six percent of sales, while fees for food and beverage sales are approximately three percent of sales.
The franchise agreement has a term of 30 years.

Ritz-Carlton

We hold management agreements with Ritz-Carlton, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marriott, to manage nine of our hotels. These agreements have an initial
term of 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of Ritz-Carlton. Base management fees vary from two to five percent of sales and incentive management fees, if any, are generally equal to 20% of available cash flow or operating
profit, after we have received a priority return as defined in the agreements.

Starwood

As of December 31, 2008, 22 of our hotels are subject to operating and license agreements with Starwood under which Starwood operates the hotels, for
an initial term of 20 years, with two renewal terms of 10 years


HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

each. Starwood receives compensation in the form of a base fee of 1% of annual gross operating revenues, and an incentive fee of 20% of annual gross
operating profit, after we have received a priority return of 10.75% on our purchase price and other investments in the hotels.

The
license agreements address matters relating to the subject brand, including rights to use service marks, logos, symbols and trademarks, such as those associated with Westin, Sheraton. W, Luxury Collection and St. Regis, as well as matters relating
to compliance with certain standards and policies and (including through other agreements in the case of certain hotels) the provision of certain system program and centralized services. The license agreements have an initial term of 20 years each,
with two renewal terms of 10 years each at the option of the licensor. Licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees of 5% of room sales and 2% of food and beverage sales.

We have termination rights relating to the operating agreements on 12 specified hotels upon the sale of those hotels. Such termination rights are
currently active with respect to three of such hotels. With respect to two of those hotels, we have the limited right to also terminate one license agreement annually. With respect to nine of the 12 specified hotels, we have the right beginning in
2016 to sell 35% of such hotels (measured by EBITDA), not to exceed two hotels annually, free and clear of the existing operating agreement over a period of time without the payment of a termination fee. With respect to any termination of an
operating agreement on sale, the proposed purchaser would need to meet the requirements for transfer under the applicable license agreement.

Other Managers

We also hold management agreements with hotel management companies such as Hyatt, Hilton, Four Seasons and
Fairmont for 17 of our hotels. These agreements generally provide for an initial term of 10 to 20 years with renewal terms at the option of either party or, in some cases, the hotel management company of up to an additional one to 15 years. The
agreements generally provide for payment of base management fees equal to one to four percent of sales. Sixteen of the seventeen agreements also provide for incentive management fees generally equal to 10 to 30 percent of available cash flow,
operating profit, or net operating income, as defined in the agreements, after we have received a priority return.

16.

Geographic and Business Segment Information

We
consider each one of our hotels to be an operating segment, none of which meets the threshold for a reportable segment. We also allocate resources and assess operating performance based on individual hotels. All of our other real estate investment
activities (primarily our leased hotels and office buildings) are immaterial and meet the aggregation criteria, and thus, we report one segment: hotel ownership. Our foreign operations consist of four properties located in Canada, two properties
located in Chile and one property located in Mexico. There were no intersegment sales during the periods presented. The following table presents revenues and long-lived assets for each of the geographical areas in which we operate (in millions):

Guarantees and Contingencies

We have certain
guarantees which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to various dispositions, spin-offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to
pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party. We consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote. The guarantees are listed below:

•

We remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non-lodging properties. These primarily represent certain divested restaurants that were sold
subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments. The aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately $23 million as of December 31, 2008.

•

In 1997, we owned Leisure Park Venture Limited Partnership, which owns and operates a senior living facility. We spun-off the partnership to Barceló
Crestline Corporation, formerly Crestline Capital Corporation, in the REIT conversion, but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to $14.7 million of municipal bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic
Development Authority through their maturity in 2027. However, to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee, we have been indemnified by Barceló Crestline Corporation, who, in turn, is indemnified by the current
owner of the facility.

•

In connection with the sale of two hotels in January 2005, we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases. The future minimum
lease payments are approximately $13 million through the full term of the leases, including renewal options. We believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote, and in each case, we have been indemnified by the purchaser of
the hotel.

•

In connection with the Starwood acquisition, we have three properties with environmental liabilities, primarily asbestos in non-public areas of the properties, for
which we have recorded the present value of the liability, or approximately $2.6 million, in accordance with FIN 47 “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”. The amount is based on management’s estimate of the
timing and future costs to remediate the liability. We will record the accretion expense over the period we intend to hold the hotel or until the item is remediated.

•

We are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business. On April 27, 2005, we initiated suit
against Keystone-Texas Property Holding Corporation (“Keystone”) in the 73

rd

Judicial District Court of Bexar County, Texas, Case No.
05-CI-14229, seeking a declaration that a provision of our ground lease for the property under the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter Hotel was valid and claiming that Keystone had breached that lease provision. On April 6, 2006, a Bexar County Court
granted an interlocutory motion for summary judgment that the provision was not valid and the lease provision had not been breached. Thereafter, on October 18, 2006, Keystone filed an amended counterclaim and later, a third party claim, alleging
that we tortiously interfered with Keystone’s attempted sale of the property and that we slandered Keystone’s title to the property. We believe that our actions were entirely lawful.

We are vigorously defending this claim and all other claims; however, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. We
believe that the final resolution of any of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

Related Party Transactions

In December 2006, the
insurance trust which holds split-dollar life insurance policies for Mr. J. Willard Marriott, Jr., a former member of Host’s Board of Directors, exercised its rights under its Split-Dollar Life Insurance Policies Agreement with the Company
to purchase our interest in the policy. We received approximately $4.5 million, which equaled the premiums paid on the policy since 1996 (inception) in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting for the Company. With the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
