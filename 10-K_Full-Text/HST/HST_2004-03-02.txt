Items 1 & 2    Business and Properties

We are a Maryland corporation and we operate as a self-managed and
self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT. We own our properties and conduct our operations through Host Marriott, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and in which we hold 93% of the
partnership interest. In this report we use the terms “operating partnership” or “Host LP” to refer to Host Marriott, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms “we” or
“our” refer to Host Marriott and Host LP together, unless the context indicates otherwise.

As of February 15, 2004, our lodging portfolio consisted of 113 upper-upscale and luxury full-service hotels containing approximately 57,000 rooms. Our
portfolio is geographically diverse with hotels in most of the major metropolitan areas in 28 states, Washington, D.C., Toronto and Calgary, Canada and Mexico City, Mexico. Our locations include central business districts of major cities, near
airports and resort/convention locations.

The address of our
principal executive office is 6903 Rockledge Drive, Suite 1500, Bethesda, Maryland, 20817. Our phone number is 240-744-1000. Our Internet website address is www.hostmarriott.com.

We make available free of charge, on or through our Internet website, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are
electronically filed or furnished to the SEC, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

In addition, at the Investor Information section of our
website, we have a Corporate Governance page that includes, among other things, copies of our Code of Business Conduct and Conflicts of Interest Policy for directors, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for employees, our Corporate Governance
Guidelines and the charters for each of our standing committees of our Board of Directors, which are: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Policy Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Copies of these charters and policies
are also available in print to stockholders upon request.

The Lodging
Industry

The lodging industry in the United States
consists of both private and public entities which operate in an extremely diversified market under a variety of brand names. Competition in the industry is based primarily on the level of service, quality of accommodations, location and room rates.
In order to cater to a wide variety of tastes and needs, the lodging industry is broadly divided into six groups: luxury, upper-upscale, upscale, midscale (with and without food and beverage service) and economy. Most of our hotels operate in urban
markets either as luxury properties under such brand names as Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons or as upper-upscale properties under such brand names as Marriott, Hyatt, Westin and Hilton.

Supply and demand growth in the lodging industry and the markets in which we operate may be influenced by a number of
factors, including growth of the economy, interest rates, unique local considerations and the relatively long lead time required to develop urban and resort/convention, upper-upscale and luxury hotels. Properties in the upper-upscale segment of the
lodging industry benefited from a favorable imbalance between supply and demand during the early 1990’s, driven in part by low construction levels and high gross domestic product, or GDP growth. From 1998 through 2000, supply moderately
outpaced demand, which caused slight declines in occupancy rates; however, the impact of the occupancy decline was more than offset by increases in the average daily rate during that period. In 2001, the weakening economy was significantly affected
by the September 11 terrorist attacks leading to a significant decline in demand. Over the past two years demand growth has been slowed primarily due to the threat of additional terrorist acts, the war in Iraq and, in 2002, continued weakness in the
economy. We expect the rate of supply growth, which has declined significantly since 2000, to continue to be relatively low for at least the next two years due to the limited availability of development financing for new construction. We believe
that demand growth will begin to accelerate during the first half of 2004, as the economy continues to strengthen and business travel increases.


Business Strategy

Our primary business objective is to provide superior total returns to our shareholders through a combination of appreciation in net asset value per
share, growth in earnings and dividends. In order to achieve this objective we seek to:

·

maximize the value of our existing portfolio through aggressive asset management which includes working with the managers of our hotels to continue to minimize operating costs and
increase revenues and by completing selective capital improvements designed to increase profitability;

·

acquire upper-upscale and luxury hotels, including hotels operated by leading management companies;

·

maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile that has an appropriate balance of debt and equity and provides flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry,
and improving, over the next lodging cycle, our EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio to greater than 3.0x,; and

·

opportunistically dispose of non-core assets, such as older assets with significant capital needs, assets that are at a competitive risk given potential new supply or assets in
slower-growth markets.

We believe we are
well-qualified to pursue our business strategies. Our management team has extensive experience in acquiring and financing lodging properties. We believe that management’s industry knowledge, relationships and access to market information
provide a competitive advantage with respect to identifying, evaluating, financing, acquiring and opportunistically disposing of lodging properties and that this competitive advantage carries over to the work we do to improve and maintain the
quality of our assets. These efforts include maximizing the value of our existing portfolio by overseeing our managers in their efforts to reduce operating costs and to increase revenues at our hotels, monitoring property and brand performance,
pursuing expansion and repositioning opportunities, overseeing capital expenditure budgets and forecasts, assessing return on capital expenditure opportunities and analyzing competitive supply conditions in each of our markets.

Our acquisition strategy focuses on hotels operating as upper-upscale and
luxury hotels. We continue to believe there will be opportunities to acquire these hotels at attractive multiples of cash flow and at discounts to replacement cost. Our acquisition strategy continues to focus on:

·

properties with unique locations in markets with high barriers to entry for prospective competitors, including hotels located in urban and resort/convention locations;

·

properties operated under premium brand names, such as Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, Hilton, Hyatt and Westin;

·

larger hotels that are consistent with our portfolio objectives and may require significant investment, which narrows the competition for these acquisitions;

·

underperforming hotels whose operations can be enhanced by conversion to high quality brands and/or by upgrading or adding to the existing facilities; and

·

acquisitions through various structures, including transactions involving portfolios, single assets and through joint ventures.

From 1999 through mid-2003, our acquisitions were limited by the lack of
suitable targets that complement our portfolio, inadequate returns and capital limitations due to weak investment markets. Consequently, our activity has been primarily focused on acquiring the interests of limited or joint venture partners,
consolidating our ownership of assets already included in our portfolio, and as described in “Operating Structure,” purchasing the lessee interests, which were created as part our conversion to a REIT. We believe that as a result of the
capital markets strengthening in 2003, suitable single asset and portfolio acquisition opportunities have become available; however, the number of competitive bidders for such opportunities has also correspondingly increased. We are interested in
exploring acquisitions that can be accomplished, at least in part, through the issuance of operating partnership units of Host LP, particularly where such an acquisition would result in an overall improvement in our credit profile.


We have not acquired hotels outside of the United States in recent years due to the difficulty in
identifying opportunities that meet our return criteria. However, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in international locations, and will pursue these only when we believe they will offer satisfactory returns after
adjustments for currency and country-related risks.

Operating Structure

Our operating structure is as follows:

As a result of our conversion to a
REIT, we became the sole general partner of Host LP. For each share of our common stock we issue, Host LP issues one unit of operating partnership interest, or OP unit, to us. When distinguishing between ourselves and Host LP, the primary difference
is the approximate 7% of the partnership interests of Host LP not held by us as of February 15, 2004. Our conversion to a REIT in 1998 also created the opportunity for our shareholders to generally avoid double taxation on dividend distributions (as
non-REIT corporations generally are taxed on earnings prior to distributing dividends to shareholders), provided we meet certain requirements, including the distribution of at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we believe this structure
affords our shareholders with both a potential tax advantage, as well as the increased liquidity associated with being a publicly traded company.

All of our assets are owned through Host LP or its subsidiaries, all of which are general or limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The OP
units owned by holders other than us are redeemable at the option of the holders, generally beginning one year after the date of issuance of the holder’s OP units. Upon redemption of an OP unit, a holder may receive cash from us in an amount
equal to the market value of one share of our common stock. We have the right, however, to acquire any OP unit offered for redemption directly from the holder in exchange for one share of our common stock, instead of a cash redemption by us.

As a REIT, certain tax laws limit the amount of
“non-qualifying” income we can earn, including income derived directly from the operation of hotels. As a result, we lease substantially all of our properties to a subsidiary of the operating partnership designated as a taxable REIT
subsidiary for Federal income tax purposes


or to third party lessees. The lessees enter into agreements with third party hotel operators to manage the operations of the hotels. Other assets that
produce non-qualifying income may also be held in taxable REIT subsidiaries. Unlike other subsidiaries of a REIT, taxable income of a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to Federal and state income taxes.

Lodging Properties Portfolio

Overview.

Our lodging portfolio consisted
primarily of 113 upper-upscale and luxury hotels containing approximately 57,000 rooms as of February 15, 2004. It is geographically diverse, with hotels in most of the major metropolitan areas in 28 states, Washington, D.C., Toronto and Calgary,
Canada and Mexico City, Mexico. Our locations include central business districts of major cities, near airports and resort/convention locations where further large-scale development opportunities are limited. These hotels, because of their
locations, typically benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors. Historically, our properties in urban and resort/convention locations have had higher RevPAR (as defined herein) results than similar properties in suburban locations.
Our hotels have an average of approximately 504 rooms per hotel. Fifteen of our hotels have more than 750 rooms. Our hotels typically include meeting and banquet facilities, a variety of restaurants and lounges, swimming pools, gift shops and
parking facilities, the combination of which enable them to serve business, leisure and group travelers. The average age of our properties is 19 years, although many of the properties have had substantial renovations or major additions.

The following chart details our portfolio by brand as of February 15,
2004:

Our properties are
operated under premium brand names such as Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt and others, which we believe have consistently outperformed other brands in the industry. Consistent with our strategy of engaging the leading hotel management companies to
operate our properties, we converted our 498-room Swissôtel Boston to the Boston Hyatt Regency on June 26, 2003 and we converted our 365-room Atlanta Swissôtel to the Westin Buckhead on January 7, 2004. We believe that the broader brand
name recognition and resources of Hyatt and Starwood will help improve operations and drive increased profitability in the long term at these hotels.

To maintain the overall quality of our lodging properties we assess annually the need for refurbishments, replacements and capital improvements.
Typically, room refurbishments occur at intervals of approximately seven years, based on an annual review of the condition of each property. However, the timing of refurbishments may vary based on the type of property and equipment being replaced
and are generally divided into the following types: soft goods, hard goods and infrastructure. Soft goods include items such as carpeting, bed spreads, curtains and wall vinyl and may require more frequent updates to maintain brand quality
standards. Hard goods include furniture such as dressers, desks, couches, restaurant chairs and tables and are generally not replaced as frequently. Infrastructure includes the physical plant of the hotel, including such items as the roof,
elevators, façade, fire systems, etc., which are regularly maintained and then replaced at the end of their useful lives. The management agreements for the majority of our properties require us to escrow 5% of hotel sales for refurbishments,
and on average, we spend approximately $180 million to $220 million on replacements and refurbishments of soft and hard goods. In addition to amounts escrowed under the management agreement, we


will fund infrastructure improvements and, on average, spend approximately $20 million to $30 million annually. In addition to capital spending for
replacement and refurbishment of the properties, we fund projects where we believe our return on investment will exceed our targeted corporate return on capital. For example, in 2001, we completed a $25 million, 50,000 square foot spa facility for
The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. All capital expenditure decisions, however, are based on the economic environment and our cash requirements, and as a result, we will occasionally spend less than these amounts. For example, in 2002 and 2003, we reduced our
capital expenditures based on our assessment of the operating environment and to preserve capital. During this period, our capital expenditures were focused on property maintenance and improvements designed to maintain appropriate levels of quality.
As a result of the commitment we have historically made to maintaining our assets, we believe that the reductions in capital expenditures during the last two years have not adversely affected the long-term value of our portfolio. As the industry
recovers, we plan to return to our strategy of pursuing capital expenditure projects designed to enhance the value of our hotels.

Development Projects.

During 2003, we began construction on a project to expand the Memphis Marriott by 200 rooms and to
connect the property to the adjacent convention center. We expect to spend approximately $15 million on the expansion which will be completed in 2004. In January 2002, we opened The Ritz-Carlton, Naples Golf Resort, which is located approximately
three miles from our Ritz-Carlton, Naples beachfront hotel. The Golf Resort had a development cost of approximately $75 million and includes 15,000 square feet of meeting space, four food and beverage outlets and full access to the Tiburon Golf
Club, a 36-hole Greg Norman designed golf complex bordering the hotel. We own a 49% limited partner interest in the partnership that owns Tiburon Golf Club, and invested $3 million in 2002 to complete the 36-hole golf club.

Foreign Operations.

We currently own four
Canadian properties and one Mexican property containing a total of 1,952 rooms. During each of 2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately 3%, or $120 million, of our revenues were attributed to foreign operations, while the remaining 97% were attributed to
our domestic properties.

Competition.

The lodging industry is highly competitive, and over the past decade there has been a proliferation of the number of brands in the lodging industry. Competition is often specific to individual
markets and is based on a number of factors, including location, brand, price, guest amenities and service, as well as property condition. Our competition includes hotels operated under brands in the upper-upscale and luxury full-service segments,
as well as hotels operated under upscale or other lower tier brands in many locations. Many management contracts do not have restrictions on the ability of management companies to convert, franchise or develop other hotel properties in our markets.
As a result, our hotels in a given market often compete with hotels which our managers may own, invest in, manage or franchise.

We believe that our properties enjoy competitive advantages associated with their operations under the Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, Hyatt, Westin
and Hilton hotel brand systems. The national marketing programs and reservation systems of these brands, combined with the strong management systems and expertise they provide, should enable our properties to perform favorably in terms of both
occupancy and room rates. Each of our managers maintains national reservation systems. Our website permits users to connect to the reservation systems for each of these brands to reserve rooms at our hotels. In addition, repeat guest business is
enhanced by guest rewards programs offered by most of these brands.

Seasonality.

Our hotel sales have traditionally experienced moderate seasonality, which varies based on the individual hotel property and the region. Additionally, hotel revenues in the fourth quarter reflect
sixteen or seventeen weeks of results compared to twelve weeks for each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year. Hotel sales by quarter for the years 2001 through 2003 for our lodging properties are as follows:

Other Real Estate Investments

In addition to our 113 full-service hotels, we maintain investments, which are not consolidated in our financial statements, in a joint venture and
partnerships that in the aggregate own four full-service hotels, 120 limited-service hotels, the Tiburon Golf Club, and other investments. Typically, we manage these investments and conduct business through a combination of general and limited
partnership and limited liability company interests. As of December 31, 2003, the combined balance sheets of these investments included approximately $1.2 billion in assets and $0.9 billion in debt, principally first mortgages on hotel properties,
senior notes secured by the ownership interests in the partnership and mezzanine debt. All of the debt of these entities is non-recourse to us and our subsidiaries.

We also have a leasehold interest in 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties and 18 Residence Inns, which, in a series of
related transactions, were sold to Hospitality Properties Trust and leased back prior to 1997. As part of our conversion to a REIT, these properties were subleased to Barceló Crestline Corporation, formerly Crestline Capital Corporation
(“Crestline”). The initial term of these leases expire between 2010 and 2012 and are renewable at our option.

For a more detailed discussion of our other real estate investments, including a summary of the outstanding debt balances of our affiliates, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Investments in Affiliates” and Notes 3 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—”Investments in Affiliates” and
“Leases.”


Environmental and Regulatory Matters

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or
operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the
presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or
operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released asbestos-containing materials. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these
restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures. In connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels, we may be potentially liable for various environmental costs or liabilities. Although we are currently not aware of
any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us, we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future.

Material Agreements

Substantially all of our hotels are managed and operated by third parties pursuant to management agreements with our lessee subsidiaries. The initial term
of our management agreements is generally 15 to 20 years with one or more renewal terms. Our management agreements with our operators typically include the terms described below.

·

General.

Under each management agreement, the manager provides comprehensive management services to the applicable lessee.

·

Operational services

.    The managers generally have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the day-to-day operation
of the hotels, including establishing all room rates, processing reservations, procuring inventories, supplies and services, providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers’ technical and operational experts
and promoting and publicizing of the hotels. The manager receives compensation in the form of a base management fee, typically 3% and calculated as a percentage of gross revenues, and an incentive management fee, typically calculated as a percentage
(10% to 50%) of operating profit, up to certain limits (typically 20% of cumulative operating profit), after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel.

·

Executive supervision and management services.

The managers provide all managerial and other employees for the hotels, review the operation and
maintenance of the hotels, prepare reports, budgets and projections, provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotel, such as planning and policy services, financial planning, divisional financial services, risk management
services, product planning and development, employee staffing and training, corporate executive management, legislative and governmental representation and certain in-house legal services, and protect trademarks, trade-names and service marks.

·

Chain services

.    The management agreements require the manager to furnish chain services that are generally furnished on a centralized basis. Such
services include: (1) the development and operation of certain computer systems and reservation services, (2) regional management and administrative services, regional marketing and sales services, regional training services, manpower development
and relocation of regional personnel and (3) such additional central or regional services as may from time to time be more efficiently performed on a regional or group basis rather than at an individual hotel. Costs and expenses incurred in
providing these services are generally allocated among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates.

·

Working capital and fixed asset supplies

.    Our management agreements typically require us to maintain working capital for each hotel
and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies (for example, linen,


china, glassware, silver and uniforms). We are also responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds
available from hotel operations are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels.

·

Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment replacements

.    Under the agreements, we are required to provide to the manager all necessary furniture, fixtures and
equipment for the operation of the hotels (including funding any required furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements). The management agreements generally provide that, on an annual basis, the manager will prepare a list of furniture, fixtures
and equipment to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the funds that are necessary, which is subject to our review or approval. For purposes of funding the furniture, fixtures
and equipment replacements, a specified percentage (typically 5%) of the gross revenues of the hotel is deposited by the manager in an escrow account. However, for 78 of our hotels, we have entered into an agreement with Marriott International to
allow us to fund such expenditures directly as incurred from one account which we control, subject to maintaining a minimum balance of the greater of $29 million, or 30% of total annual specified contributions, rather than escrowing funds at
accounts at each hotel.

·

Building alterations, improvements and renewals.

The management agreements require the manager to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures
necessary for major repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals and replacements to the structural, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and vertical transportation elements of each hotel which we are required to
review and approve based on their recommendations and our judgment. In addition to the foregoing, the management agreements generally provide that the manager may propose such changes, alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required, in
the manager’s reasonable judgment, to keep the hotel in a competitive, efficient and economical operating condition consistent with the manager’s brand standards, over which we also have approval authority.

·

Sale of the hotel.

Most of the management agreements limit our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the hotels by requiring that the transferee
assume the related management agreements and meet specified other conditions, including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager.

·

Service marks.

During the term of the management agreements, the service mark, symbols and logos used by the manager may be used in the operation of
the hotel. Any right to use the service marks, logo and symbols and related trademarks at a hotel will terminate with respect to that hotel upon termination of the management agreement with respect to such hotel.

·

Termination fee.

While most of our management agreements are not terminable prior to their full term in connection with casualties, condemnations or
the sale of the related hotels, we have negotiated rights to terminate management agreements in connection with the sale of Marriott-branded hotels within certain limitations, including a pool of 46 hotels, 75% of which (as measured by EBITDA) may
be sold free and clear of their existing management agreements over a ten year period.

·

Performance Termination.

Many of the management agreements provide for termination rights in the case of a manager’s failure to meet certain
financial performance criteria. Similarly, certain of the management agreements condition the manager’s right to extend the term upon satisfaction of certain financial performance criteria.

Employees

On February 15, 2004, we had 182 employees, including approximately 27 employees at the Sacramento Airport Host hotel.
Fourteen of our employees at the Sacramento Airport Host hotel are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that is subject to review and renewal on a regular basis. Employees at our other hotels are employed by our management companies.


Certain of our third-party managed hotels also are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are
subject to review and renewal on a regular basis. We believe that we and our managers generally have good relations with labor unions at our hotels. We and our managers have not experienced any material business interruptions as a result of labor
disputes.

Certain Policies

The following is a discussion of our policies with respect to investments,
financing, lending and certain other activities. Our policies with respect to these activities are determined by our Board of Directors and may be amended or revised from time to time at the discretion of the Board of Directors.

Investment Policies

Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate.

We are required to conduct all of our
investment activities through Host LP. Our investment objectives are to:

·

achieve long-term sustainable growth in Funds From Operations per diluted share and cash flow;

·

maximize the value of our existing portfolio through an aggressive asset management program which includes focusing on selectively improving and expanding our hotels and, when
appropriate, pursuing alternate real estate uses;

·

acquire additional existing and newly developed upscale and luxury full-service hotels in targeted markets (primarily focusing on downtown hotels in core business districts in major
metropolitan markets and resort/convention locations);

·

complete our current development and expansion program, and selectively develop and construct upper-upscale and luxury full-service hotels; and

·

recycle capital through opportunistic asset sales and selective dispositions of non-core assets.

We also may participate with other entities in property ownership through joint ventures, partnerships or other types of
co-ownership. Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness may be incurred in connection with acquiring investments. Any such financing or indebtedness will have priority
over our equity interest in such property.

Investments in
Real Estate Mortgages.

While we will emphasize equity real estate investments, we may, at our discretion, invest in mortgages and other similar interests. We do not intend to invest to a significant extent in mortgages or
deeds of trust, but may acquire mortgages as a strategy for acquiring ownership of a property or the economic equivalent thereof, subject to the investment restrictions applicable to REITs. In addition, we may invest in mortgage-related securities
and/or may seek to issue securities representing interests in such mortgage-related securities as a method of raising additional funds.

Securities of, or Interests in, Persons Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities and Other Issuers.

Subject to the
percentage ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or invest in securities of other issuers, including for the
purpose of exercising control over such entities. We may acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies. No such investments
will be made, however, unless the Board of Directors determines that the proposed investment would not cause either Host LP or us to be an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Financing Policies

Neither our nor Host LP’s organizational documents contain restrictions
on incurring debt. The indenture for our senior notes and our existing credit facility impose limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness. We may,


from time to time, reduce our outstanding indebtedness by repurchasing a portion of such outstanding indebtedness, subject to certain restrictions contained
in Host LP’s partnership agreement and the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. We will, from time to time, re-evaluate our borrowing policies in light of then current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market
conditions, market values of properties, growth and acquisition opportunities, our goal of obtaining an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of 3.0x or greater and other factors. Consequently, our financing policy is subject to modification and change.
We may waive or modify our borrowing policy without notice to, or vote of, the holders of any of our securities or any securities of Host LP.

To the extent that the Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital through equity offerings, OP unit offerings,
debt financing or retention of cash flow or a combination of these methods. The net proceeds of all equity capital raised will be contributed to Host LP in exchange for OP Units, which will dilute the percentage ownership interest of Host LP’s
limited outside (or third party) partners.

In the future, we
may seek to extend, expand, reduce or renew our existing credit facility, or obtain new credit facilities or lines of credit for the purpose of making acquisitions or capital improvements or providing working capital or meeting the taxable income
distribution requirements for REITs under the Internal Revenue Code. We have issued in the past, and may in the future, issue securities senior to our common shares or Host LP OP units, including preferred shares and debt securities (either of which
may be convertible into common shares or OP units or may be accompanied by warrants to purchase common shares or OP units).

We have not established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single hotel or on our portfolio as a whole, although one
of our current objectives is to reduce our reliance on secured indebtedness.

Lending Policies

We may consider offering
purchase money financing in connection with the sale of a hotel where the provision of such financing will increase the value we receive for the property sold.

Policies With Respect to Other Activities

We may, but do not presently intend to, make investments other than as previously described. Other than di minimus amounts, we will make investments only
through Host LP. We and Host LP have authority to offer our securities, subject to Board of Director approval, and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire certain securities in the open market or otherwise and may engage in such activities in the
future. We and Host LP also may make loans to joint ventures in which we may participate in the future to meet working capital needs. We do not, and Host LP does not, intend to engage in trading, underwriting, agency distribution or sale of
securities of other issuers. Our policies with respect to such activities may be reviewed and modified from time to time by our Board of Directors without notice to, or the vote of, the holders of any securities of ours or Host LP.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Legal Proceedings

We believe all of the lawsuits in which we are a defendant, including the following lawsuits, are without merit and we
intend to defend vigorously against such claims; however, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of any of the lawsuits. Management believes that the final resolution of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition.

Accelerated High Yield Growth Fund, Ltd., et al.
v. HMC Hotel Properties II Limited Partnership et al., C.A. No. 18254NC.

This litigation represents the last in a series of cases that began in 1996 in response to a tender offer by our predecessor for interests in the
Marriott Hotel Properties II Limited Partnership, or MHP II, and expanded to cover the 1998 roll-up of MHP II into Host LP.


In late 2001, we reached an agreement to settle two MHP II-related class actions—one in Florida
state court, the other in Delaware state court—in which we agreed to pay $12,000 per limited partnership unit of MHP II. The settlement included all claims arising out of both the 1996 tender offer and the REIT conversion. MacKenzie Patterson
Special Fund 2, L.P., or MacKenzie Patterson, elected to opt out of this settlement with respect to its 28 limited partnership units.

On August 23, 2000, MacKenzie Patterson filed this lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against us alleging breach of contract, fraud, and conversion in the
MHP II roll-up. MacKenzie Patterson alleges that our acquisition of MHP II violated the partnership agreement and that the general partner breached its fiduciary duties by allowing the roll-up to occur. MacKenzie Patterson is seeking unspecified
damages. Discovery is underway in the case.

Joseph S. Roth
et al. v. MOHS Corporation et al, Case No. 00CH14500 (“O’Hare Suites”)

.    On October 5, 2000, Joseph S. Roth and Robert M. Niedelman, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County,
Illinois, Chancery Division, against us, Marriott International, and MOHS Corporation (one of our subsidiaries and a former general partner of O’Hare Suites). On July 2, 2003, the court ruled on plaintiffs’ motion for class certification,
certifying a 256-person class on plaintiffs’ contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims, but denying certification on their six tort claims (which included unjust enrichment, fraud, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and conspiracy to
defraud).

The certified class of plaintiffs consists of 256
limited partners who owned units in Mutual Benefit Marriott Chicago Suites Hotel Partners, L.P. as of the date of the roll-up of the partnership into Host LP on December 30, 1998. Plaintiffs allege that we improperly paid incentive management fees
to the hotel manager in 1997 and 1998, which resulted in an inadequate appraised value for their limited partner units in connection with the acquisition of O’Hare Suites during our conversion to a REIT. Plaintiffs are seeking damages of
approximately $17 million.

On August 18, 2003, plaintiffs
filed: (1) a class certification motion for the tort claims for a subclass of approximately 200 former limited partners residing in Illinois and six other states; and (2) a motion for partial summary judgment on their breach of contract claim. On
the latter motion, we are seeking our own summary judgment ruling that the incentive management fee payment was appropriate under a proper reading of the partnership agreement, and in light of MOHS’s obligations under its bank agreement. Judge
Nowicki heard both motions on February 26, 2004 and is expected to rule on the motions in several months. A trial date has not yet been set.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

In the following table we set forth certain information regarding those persons currently serving as our executive officers
as of February 15, 2004.



PART II

Item 5.    Market for our common stock and related shareholder matters

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Stock Exchange, the Pacific Stock Exchange and the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange and is traded under the symbol “HMT.” The following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Tape.

We have not declared
dividends on our common stock during 2002 or 2003. See “Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Overview.” Under the terms of our senior notes indenture and the credit facility, our ability
to pay dividends and make other payments is dependent on our ability to satisfy certain financial requirements. See “Risk Factors—Financial Risks—Our future cash distributions on common stock may be limited by the terms of our
indebtedness and the terms of our preferred stock.”

As of
February 15, 2004, there were 42,311 holders of record of our common stock. However, because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we believe that there are considerably more
beneficial holders of our common stock than record holders. As of February 15, 2004, there were 2,492 holders of OP Units, each of which is redeemable for cash, or, at our election, convertible into common stock.

Our ability to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code is
facilitated by limiting the number of shares of our stock that a person may own. Our charter provides that, subject to limited exceptions, no person or persons acting as a group may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code, more than 9.8% of the lesser of the number or value of shares of common stock outstanding or 9.8% of the lesser of the number or value of the issued and outstanding preferred or other shares of any class or series of our
stock. The Board of Directors has the authority to increase the ownership limit from time to time, but does not have the authority to do so to the extent that after giving effect to such increase, five beneficial owners of capital stock could
beneficially own in the aggregate more than 49.5% of the outstanding capital stock. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Stock Ownership—There are possible adverse consequences of limits on ownership of our common stock.”


Item 6.    Selected Financial Data

The following table presents certain selected historical financial data
which has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements for the five years ended December 31, 2003. The historical information contained in the following table for our 2003, 2002 and 2001 operations primarily represents gross
hotel-level revenues and expenses of our properties. During 2000 and 1999, we owned the hotels but leased them to third-party lessees and, accordingly, during these periods our historical revenues primarily represent rental income generated by our
leases.

(1)

Discontinued operations reflect the disposition of nine properties since January 1, 2002, five properties classified as held for sale in accordance with SFAS 144 and the gain on
disposition and business interruption proceeds of the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel as of December 31, 2003.


Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis Of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition

The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions
that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in “Forward Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” contained elsewhere in this report.

Overview

Structure and Business.

We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns 113
full-service hotel properties as of February 15, 2004, which operate primarily in the luxury and upper-upscale hotel sectors. As of December 31, 2003, Host Marriott was the largest hotel REIT in the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trust’s composite index. Host Marriott conducts its operations through Host LP, of which Host Marriott is the sole general partner.

Our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry—including Marriott,
Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt, Four Seasons, Hilton and Westin. The majority of our properties are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/convention locations. The target profile for our portfolio includes luxury
and upper-upscale full-service properties in locations where further large scale development is limited, which we believe allows us to maintain room rate and occupancy premiums over our competitors. We seek to maximize the value of our portfolio
through aggressive asset management, by directing the managers of our hotels to maximize property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements. The majority of our customers fall into two broad groups: transient and group travelers.
Our transient business, which includes the individual corporate and leisure traveler, is generally accommodated at a premium rate when compared to other customer types. Group business includes hotel bookings related to conferences and events. A
smaller portion of our customer base results from contracts for a specified number of rooms over a fixed period.

Our hotels are required to be operated by third-party managers. We retain these third party managers under long-term agreements under which they earn base
and incentive management fees related to revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to operate the property including purchasing inventory and paying wages, utilities
and property taxes and other expenses. Our results of operations primarily represent hotel-level sales, which are room, food and beverage and other ancillary income such as telephone, parking and other guest services. Operating expenses consist of
the costs to provide these services, as well as management fees paid to the operators of our hotels, real and personal property taxes, utilities, ground rent, equipment rent, property insurance, depreciation and other costs. We generally receive a
cash distribution, which reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation), from our hotel managers each period.

Key Performance Indicators

We have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business. These indicators include room revenue per available room, or
RevPAR, and RevPAR penetration index.

RevPAR is a commonly
used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include revenues from food and beverage or
parking, telephone, or other guest services generated by the property. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels. We also use RevPAR to compare the
results of our hotels between periods and to compare results of our comparable hotels. See “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics” for further discussion.


We assess what causes changes in RevPAR because changes that result from occupancy as compared to those
that result from room rate have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage,
parking sand other hotel amenities, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, would not result in these additional room-related
costs. For this reason, while operating profit would typically increase when occupancy rises, RevPAR increases due to higher room rates would have a greater impact on our profitability.

A related revenue measure for our hotels is the RevPAR penetration index. The RevPAR penetration index reflects each
property’s RevPAR in relation to the RevPAR for that property’s competitive set. We use the measure as an indicator of a property’s market share. For example, a RevPAR penetration index of 100 would indicate that a hotel’s RevPAR
is, on average, the same as its competitors. A RevPAR penetration index exceeding 100 would indicate that a hotel maintains a RevPAR premium in relation to its competitive set, while a RevPAR penetration index below 100 would be an indicator that a
hotel is underperforming its competitive set. One critical component in this calculation is the determination of a hotel’s competitive set. Factors that we consider include geographic proximity, as well as the level of service provided at the
property. For example, a hotel located near a convention center might have a competitive set that includes other hotels located in close proximity to the convention center. In addition, a luxury hotel might include other luxury or upper-upscale
hotels in its competitive set but not economy hotels. Our methodology for determining a hotel’s competitive set, however, may differ from those used by other owners and/or managers.

One of our key performance indicators is the profitability of each hotel. Among other things, we use hotel adjusted
operating profit, which is a non-GAAP measure, to evaluate this. Hotel adjusted operating profit measures property-level results before funding furniture, fixtures and equipment reserves and debt service and is a supplemental measure of individual
property-level profitability. The comparable hotel adjusted operating profit that we discuss is an aggregation of the adjusted operating profit for each of our comparable hotels. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Comparable Hotel Operating
Results” for further discussion. We also use, among other things, FFO per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company-wide profitability. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures—FFO per Diluted Share” for further discussion.

Each of the non-GAAP measures should be considered by
investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit and earnings per share.

2003 and 2004 Lodging Industry Assessment

We believe the lodging industry was negatively effected in 2003 by low levels of business travel resulting from a weak economy (predominantly in the first
half of the year), the war in Iraq, continued changes in terrorist threat levels and travel reductions and restrictions related to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Strong economic growth in the United States economy in the second half of
2003 helped improve lodging demand, but generally not enough to offset the weak lodging demand in the first half.

Our industry outlook for 2004 is more optimistic. Historically, we have seen that lodging demand in the United States correlates to U.S. Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth, with typically a one to two quarter lag period especially within the luxury and upper-upscale sectors of the lodging industry. Therefore, given the relatively strong U.S. GDP growth in the second half of 2003 and the forecasts
for 2004, we are optimistic about improvement in lodging demand in 2004. In addition, based on these GDP forecasts, as well as the anticipated strengthening of corporate profits and capital investment, we expect an increase in business-related
travel and improvement in the pace of group bookings.

In
addition to the favorable demand trends forecasted to affect the lodging industry in general, we believe we may be able to capitalize on the low supply growth trends that have existed during the past few years. Supply growth in the lodging industry
and the markets in which we operate may be influenced by a number of factors, including growth of the economy, interest rates, local considerations and the relatively long lead time required to build urban and resort/convention hotels. Historically,
supply growth has averaged approximately 3% per year.


However, since 2000 the growth of new supply for the entire lodging industry has exhibited a declining trend below the historic average (2.6%, 1.9%, 1.6%,
and 1.2% in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively) based on data prepared by Smith Travel Research and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The upper-upscale segment experienced stronger supply growth than did the industry as a whole during this period,
but also exhibited a declining trend (3.7%, 2.9%, 3.2%, and 1.9% in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.) We believe that the low construction levels over the past few years, together with low expectations for additional supply growth over the
next few years, which is because new full-service hotels typically take several years to build, will lead to an imbalance between supply and growing demand that will allow for improved RevPAR performance at our hotels.

In 2003, our hotel revenues (as presented in our statement of operations)
declined 2.3% from 2002 as a result of the factors discussed above. However, because accounting rules require us to reclassify the results of operations of hotels we have sold or designated as held for sale to discontinued operations, the decrease
in revenues was actually higher. Hotel sales, including the results of hotels acquired or disposed of during 2003 and 2002 through the date of their respective disposition or acquisition, declined 3.4%, which follows a similar decline of 3.6% in
2002 from 2001. Hotel revenues were also down in the fourth quarter of 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2002, but the decline in revenues was less than the decline in the first three quarters of 2003. In response to the decline in
operations of our hotels over the last several years, we have been working with our managers to achieve cost reductions at our properties. We believe these efforts have slowed the decline in the operating margins of our hotels and should create some
long-term efficiencies. However, in 2003, our operating margins declined further because significant components of our costs, such as employee wages and benefits, property taxes, insurance and utilities increased at a rate greater than inflation. In
addition, other costs, such as property taxes are relatively inflexible and tend to remain somewhat constant regardless of any reduction in hotel property revenues. As a result, a change in our revenues usually results in a greater percentage change
in our earnings and cash flows.

During 2003, the average
RevPAR penetration index, or market share, for our comparable hotels modestly declined, but it remains at a premium in relation to our competitive set. We believe that this decline in market share occurred because:

·

our hotels generally have a higher percentage of their revenues generated by corporate group and corporate transient customers than their competitors and the corporate group and
transient business were among the poorest performing sectors in 2003;

·

the managers of many of our hotels were anticipating an improvement in corporate business in the second half of 2003, leading them to turn down lower-rated business that was
ultimately not replaced with the anticipated higher-rated business;

·

our hotels generally have a lower percentage of their revenues generated by leisure travelers than their competitors and the leisure business was among the best performing sectors
in 2003; and

·

Certain of our managers did not fully access internet distribution channels until early 2004, which generally resulted in fewer internet bookings than our competitors.

As lodging demand continues to grow and, in
particular, as corporate group and corporate transient business strengthens, we believe that our hotels will regain the majority of the market share lost in 2003. For 2004, we expect RevPAR to increase 3% to 4% for our comparable hotels. We also
expect certain of our costs, such as wages, benefits and insurance, to continue to increase at a rate greater than inflation, which will likely result in flat operating margins for 2004.

While we believe the combination of improved demand trends and low supply growth trends in the lodging industry and our
strategic cost reductions create the possibility for improvements in our business in 2004, there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will be achieved. The trends discussed above may not occur for
any number of reasons, including slower than anticipated growth in the economy, changes in travel patterns and the continued threat of additional terrorist attacks, all of which may result in lower revenues or higher operating costs and declining
operating margins.


Management’s Priorities

Based on our primary business objectives and forecasted operating conditions, our key priorities, or financial strategies,
over the next several years include the following:

·

to acquire upper-upscale and luxury hotels in unique locations where further large scale development is limited for prospective competitors, including hotels located in urban and
resort/convention locations;

·

to use the proceeds from the sale of non-core hotels that do not fit within our business strategy of owning upper-upscale and luxury properties in urban and resort/convention
locations, to acquire properties more closely aligned to our profile or repay debt (including up to $382 million in senior notes as specifically permitted by our Board of Directors in November 2003);

·

to implement selective capital improvements designed to increase profitability and direct our managers to minimize operating costs and increase revenues;

·

to invest capital in our existing portfolio where the return on investment is favorable. Potential investments at our hotels could include increasing the number of rooms, adding a
spa, fitness facility, convention or meeting space or upgrading the infrastructure, such as energy efficient heating and cooling systems; and

·

to reduce our leverage to achieve an interest coverage ratio of 2.0x or greater under our senior notes indenture; thereby lifting the restrictions which generally prohibit us from
incurring additional debt or paying dividends above the minimum amount required to maintain Host Marriott’s REIT status.

As we discussed previously, our acquisition efforts to acquire new properties over the past several years have been limited by several factors, including
a lack of suitable targets that complement our portfolio and capital limitations due to weak equity markets. Similarly, we have limited our capital expenditures the past two years based on our assessment of the operating environment and to preserve
capital. As a result, management has focused its priorities more on recycling capital and improving our overall leverage and financial covenants by selling non-core hotels and using the proceeds to refinance or retire outstanding debt. For further
detail on steps we have taken to meet our objectives, see the discussion in “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt Repayment and Refinancing” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash Provided by or Used in Investing
Activities.”

Results of Operations

The following table reflects key line items from our audited statements of
operations and other significant operating statistics (in millions, except operating statistics and percentages):

(1)

Amount represents operating costs and expenses per our statements of operations less corporate and other expenses.


2003 Compared to 2002

As previously discussed, our hotel sales declined 3.4%, however, due to the reclassification of the results of assets sold
or designated as held for sale to discontinued operations, hotel revenues on our statement of operations only declined 2.3% for full year 2003, principally due to the decline in room sales of 2.8%. For 2003, our comparable hotel RevPAR of $96.85 was
down 4.2% from 2002, reflecting a decline in average room rate of 1.9% and a decrease in occupancy of 1.6 percentage points, primarily due to reduced transient demand for both business and leisure travel. Beginning in the fourth quarter, demand
began to improve relative to the first three quarters of 2003, with less than one-half a percent decrease in room rate and a slight decrease in occupancy over the fourth quarter of 2002. While we have begun to see a general increase in demand, the
weakest component of our business continues to be the higher-rated individual transient business traveler which historically has paid the highest average room rates. Our managers have partially offset this decline with additional group and contract
business that has resulted in lower average room rates.

While
our overall results for 2003 declined, we did experience improvements in comparable hotel RevPAR in four geographic regions for the fourth quarter and two regions for the full year. Comparable hotel RevPAR for our Washington D.C. Metro region
increased 4.0% for the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year. These increases were driven by strong transient demand particularly at our Northern Virginia properties as occupancy increased 0.9 percentage points for both the fourth quarter and
full year for the comparable hotels. Our Florida region also had a slight increase in comparable hotel RevPAR for the year, but a slight decrease for the fourth quarter. The results were primarily driven by our properties in the Ft. Lauderdale and
Tampa markets, which benefited from stronger group demand and leisure travel.

The relative improvement of these regions was offset by the overall decline in comparable hotel RevPAR in most of our regions. In particular, our New England and South Central regions had significant declines in
comparable hotel RevPAR of 15.1% and 5.8%, respectively, for the year and 14.4% and 5.7%, respectively, for the fourth quarter. The comparable hotel results in the South Central region were primarily affected by our hotels in San Antonio where full
year occupancy was down 3.4 percentage points and average room rate declined 3.6%. The decrease in demand was primarily attributable to a reduction in city-wide convention activity in 2003. The decline in our New England properties was driven by the
performance of our three comparable hotels in Boston which had comparable hotel RevPAR declines of 18.8% and 19.7%, respectively, for the fourth quarter and full year. The New England results discussed above do not include the Boston Copley Marriott
which is considered a non-comparable hotel, which had an increase in RevPAR for the fourth quarter of 1.6%.

Our rental income represents lease income from our 71 limited-service hotels and three office property leases, as well as lease income from one
full-service hotel. Operations at the leased limited-service hotel properties continued to suffer due to increased competition from full-service and limited-service properties and weak economic conditions in their markets, resulting in a very
competitive environment and lower room rates. We expect that there will be slower improvement in these properties in 2004 than in our full-service properties, in part, because a significant portion of these limited-service properties will be
undergoing renovation in 2004 to enable them to compete with the newer supply in the future, which will result in a decrease in the number of available rooms in 2004 while these renovations are underway.

In 2003, we also recognized $9.6 million of other income from the settlement
of a claim that we brought against our directors and officers insurance carriers for reimbursement of defense costs and settlement payments incurred in resolving a series of related actions brought against us and Marriott International which arose
from the sale of certain limited partnerships units to investors prior to 1993.

Operating Costs and Expenses.

The increase in operating costs and expenses is primarily the result of increases in wages, benefits, insurance and utilities at our hotels. Rental and other
expense for our limited-service hotel leases, office properties and one full-service hotel that we leased are included in other property-level expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Consistent with the relatively fixed nature of
these costs, our operating expenses increased in both 2003 and 2002 despite the decrease in revenues in both years. We expect that costs such as wages, benefits and insurance will continue to increase at a rate greater than inflation.


Corporate and Other Expenses

.    Corporate and other expenses primarily
consist of employee salaries and other costs such as stock-based employee compensation expense, corporate insurance, audit fees, building rent and system costs. The increase in corporate and other expenses is primarily due to increases in corporate
insurance and the appreciation of Host Marriott’s stock price, which affects the stock-based employee compensation expense.

Interest Expense

.    Interest expense increased 6.3% over 2002 as a result of the payment of aggregate call premiums of $25
million and the acceleration of deferred financing fees of $6 million associated with the prepayment of our senior notes and various mortgages during 2003. In 2004, we expect that as a result of the retirement of approximately $500 million of debt
(including $262 million retired in January 2004) that interest expense will decrease, however we will continue to incur additional expenses such as call premiums and the acceleration of deferred financing to the extent that we prepay or refinance
our debt prior to its original maturity.

Loss on Foreign
Currency and Derivative Contracts.

The loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts is due primarily to the approximate $18 million loss from the forward currency exchange contracts for our four Canadian hotels being
deemed ineffective for accounting purposes. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt and Effect of Financial Covenants—Mortgage Debt Covenants” for further discussion.

Minority Interest Income (Expense)

.    Minority
interest income (expense) consists of our minority partners’ share of the income or loss in consolidated hotel partnerships and the approximate 7% percentage ownership in Host LP. The change from 2002 in minority interest primarily reflects
earnings in the current year, primarily as a result of the gain on the settlement of the World Trade Center hotel, compared to a net loss in 2002.

Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Affiliates

.    Equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates consists of our portion of the earnings
(losses) of two partnerships in which we own non-controlling interests and do not consolidate in our financial statements. The increase in the loss can be attributed to an increase in the net loss of CBM Joint Venture LLC in 2003. See
“Investments in Affiliates” for a discussion of this partnership.

Discontinued Operations

.    Discontinued operations consists of the eight hotels sold in 2003 and one hotel sold in 2002, the gain on the disposition and business interruption proceeds for
the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel and five properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2003, three of which were sold in January 2004. In accordance with SFAS 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets” or SFAS 144, the results of operations for these properties in the current year and prior periods are reflected in discontinued operations.

For 2003, the eight hotels sold generated net proceeds of approximately $184 million with a net gain on disposition of
approximately $65 million, which includes a $56 million gain on the disposition of World Trade Center hotel. For 2003 and 2002, our revenues for these eight properties and the New York Marriott World Trade Center were $222 million and $120 million,
respectively, and our income before taxes was $176 million and $23 million, respectively. The St. Louis Marriott Pavilion was transferred to the mortgage lender in January 2002 in a non-cash transaction and we recognized a net gain of $13 million,
primarily as a result of the debt extinguished and the forgiveness of management fees net of the fair value of the assets surrendered. For 2003 and 2002, revenues for the five properties classified as held for sale were $42 million and $44 million,
respectively, and our income before taxes was $1 million and $4 million, respectively.

On December 3, 2003, we announced the settlement of the outstanding matters relating to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 affecting the New York Marriott World Trade Center and Financial Center hotels with
the hotels’ insurer, Marriott International, Inc. and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. As a result of these settlements, we received net insurance proceeds of approximately $372 million. As a result of this settlement, we recorded
a one-time gain of approximately $212 million, which is comprised of approximately $156 million in post-2003 business interruption proceeds and approximately $56 million from the disposition of the World Trade Center hotel. The gain on disposition
and the 2003 and 2002 business interruption income, net of expenses, related to the hotel has been reclassified to discontinued operations. The business interruption proceeds received, net of expenses, for the New York Marriott Financial Center
hotel are included in rooms revenues from continuing operations.


2002 Compared to 2001

Revenues.

Hotel revenues declined 0.2% for full year 2002 principally due to the decline in
room sales of 0.6%. As discussed previously, revenues (as presented in our statements of operations) do not reflect the actual decline in revenues because of the reclassification of the results of assets sold or designated as held for sale to
discontinued operations. Actual room sales decreased 3.6% in 2002 from 2001. For 2002, our comparable hotel RevPAR of $100.12 was down 5.1%, which was comprised of a decline in average room rate of 5.9% and a decrease in occupancy of 0.6 percentage
points. The decline in comparable hotel RevPAR was primarily attributable to reduced transient demand for business and leisure travel. While the decrease in comparable hotel RevPAR is due in part to the reduction in business and leisure travel, it
is also the result of the change in business mix at our properties. Transient business, which includes corporate and premium business travelers, which generally pay the highest average room rates has decreased by over 3% since 2000 as a percentage
of room sales. Our managers have partially offset this decline with additional group and contract business that have lower average room rates. As a result, while occupancy increased slightly, the average room rate declined significantly.

Although most regions had comparable hotel RevPAR declines in line with
our overall portfolio, we did have two regions that had stronger results. Our South Central region comparable hotel RevPAR declined by only 1.1% primarily due to strong results from our three San Antonio hotels. The Mid-Atlantic region also
outperformed the overall portfolio with a comparable hotel RevPAR decline of 2.5%. This was due to positive comparable hotel RevPAR at our Philadelphia Convention Center Marriott and Four Seasons, Philadelphia properties, offset by declines at our
suburban properties in this region.

The Pacific region had the
largest comparable hotel RevPAR decline at 8.3%. These results were largely due to the collapse of the technology market in the San Francisco area with all our hotels in that market having RevPAR declines. The North Central Region also had declines
in comparable hotel RevPAR of 6.6%, which was a function of poor results in most of the region with our Chicago and Minneapolis properties reporting significant declines.

Our rental income further declined primarily due to increased competition and weak economic conditions for the leased
limited-service hotels.

Operating Costs and
Expenses

.    Operating costs and expenses decreased primarily as a result of our efforts and those of our managers to control operating costs at the hotels and the overall decline in occupancy. Rental expense for our
limited-service hotels and office properties are included in other property-level expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. These costs, which include wages, benefits and insurance, increased at a rate greater than inflation throughout
the year.

Corporate
Expenses

.    Corporate expenses decreased principally due to a decrease in stock-based compensation. As a result of the decline in Host Marriott’s stock price and our operations in 2002, certain performance thresholds
were not met and a portion of the shares previously granted were forfeited.

Minority Interest Expense.

The variance in minority interest expense was due to the decrease in our results of operations as described above.

Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Affiliates.

The
decrease in equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates can be primarily attributed to an increase in the net loss of CBM Joint Venture LLC. See “Investments in Affiliates” for a discussion of this partnership.

Discontinued Operations

.    During January 2002,
we transferred the St. Louis Marriott Pavilion to the mortgage lender in a non-cash transaction. We recorded a gain, net of taxes, of $13 million in 2002 and a loss from operations of $3 million in 2001 as discontinued operations. We also
reclassified the operations from properties disposed of in 2003 and properties classified as held for sale in 2003 as discontinued operations in 2002 and 2001. For 2002 and 2001, revenues for these properties were $164 million and $209 million and
our income before taxes was $27 million and $8 million, respectively.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Requirements

Host Marriott is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income in order to qualify as a REIT. Because we are required to
distribute almost all of our taxable income, we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions.

Cash Balances.

As of December 31, 2003, we had $764 million of cash and cash equivalents, which was an increase of $403
million from December 31, 2002. Over the past two years our cash balances have been in excess of the $100 million to $150 million, which we had historically maintained. We expect to reduce our cash balance through the repayment of indebtedness, the
acquisition of additional hotels and further investments in our portfolio. Cash increased for the year principally as a result of our settlement of outstanding matters relating to our New York Marriott World Trade Center and Financial Center hotels
for net proceeds of approximately $372 million, the sale of eight hotels for net proceeds of approximately $184 million and Host Marriott’s two equity offerings for net proceeds of approximately $500 million, the proceeds of which were
contributed to Host LP. As described in more detail below, cash was used principally for debt repayments, regularly scheduled principal payments and the acquisition of the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa. In addition, we have $116 million of cash,
which is restricted as a result of lender restrictions (including reserves for debt service, real estate taxes, insurance, furniture and fixtures, as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits). The restricted cash balances do not have a
significant effect on our liquidity. We also currently have $250 million of availability under our credit facility and have no amounts outstanding under the facility.

Debt Repayments and Refinancings

.    Proceeds from the sale of eight hotels in 2003, combined
with the insurance settlement proceeds from the New York World Trade Center and Financial Center hotels and scheduled principal payments, enabled us to repay or redeem a total of approximately $240 million of debt in 2003 and $262 million of debt in
January 2004. In addition, we refinanced approximately $800 million of our debt in 2003, lowering our average interest rate to 7.7% and extending our debt maturities. The refinancing and repayment of this debt will result in an annual reduction in
interest expense of approximately $40 million. We have approximately $28 million of our mortgage debt maturing through December 31, 2004. Additionally, during 2004 we will have $58 million of regularly scheduled principal payments on our mortgage
debt. We believe we have sufficient cash to deal with our near-term debt maturities, as well as any decline in the cash flow from our business.

Reducing future cash interest payments and our leverage remains a key management priority. In November 2003, Host Marriott’s Board of Directors
authorized us to purchase or retire up to $600 million of our senior notes ($382 million of which remains outstanding after the January 2004 repayment of $218 million of 8.45% Series C senior notes). As a result, we may continue to redeem or
refinance additional senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time with proceeds from additional asset sales or to take advantage of favorable market conditions. We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately
negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual
restrictions and other factors. Any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and FFO per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing
fees. For example, during 2003 and the period from January 1, 2004 through February 1, 2004, we incurred interest expense resulting from the payment of call premiums and the acceleration of deferred financing fees totaling $30 million and $11
million, respectively for those periods.

Capital
Expenditures

.    We reduced our capital expenditures over the past two years because of the uncertain economic environment and our need to conserve cash. For 2003, total capital expenditures for our existing properties were
approximately $201 million. Typically, we spend approximately $200 million to $250 million annually on renewals and replacements and other capital improvements. We spent approximately $181 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures in
2003, reflecting our decision to delay certain projects


due to the start of the war in Iraq. Several of these projects have now begun and should be completed by the first quarter of 2004. Capital expenditures were
6.0% and 5.3% of hotel sales for 2003 and 2002, respectively. We expect renewal and replacement capital expenditures for 2004 to be approximately $255 million to $265 million (including approximately $20 million of projects which were in progress at
December 31, 2003, but were not fully funded), the vast majority of which would be funded by the furniture, fixture and equipment reserves established at our hotels (typically funded annually with 5% of property revenues) and, to a lesser extent by
our available cash. As of December 31, 2003, our furniture, fixture and equipment reserves totaled approximately $150 million. As a result of the challenging environment in 2003, we spent approximately $3 million on return on investment projects. In
2004, we currently estimate that we will increase our spending on return on investment projects to approximately $35 million as we are in the early stages of several large-scale repositioning projects. In addition, we spent $7 million on the $15
million, 200-room expansion of the Memphis Marriott, which we expect to complete in 2004.

Acquisitions

.    We remain interested in pursuing single asset and portfolio acquisitions and believe that there will be opportunities over the next several years to acquire assets that are
consistent with our target profile of upper-upscale and luxury properties in urban and resort/convention locations where further large scale development is limited, such as the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa, which we purchased for approximately
$321 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. We are currently in preliminary discussions with other sellers of hotels that meet our investment objectives, but have not entered into any definitive agreements. Any additional acquisitions may be funded,
in part, from the proceeds of equity offerings by Host Marriott or the issuance of OP units by Host LP, as well as proceeds from asset sales and available cash. Because we are generally restricted in our ability to incur new debt as discussed
herein, we generally will not finance any acquisitions through the issuance of debt securities until our EBITDA-to-interest coverage is 2.0x or greater. We cannot be certain as to the size or timing of acquisition opportunities or of our ability to
obtain additional acquisition financing, if needed.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Our principal
sources of cash are cash from operations, the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and our ability to obtain additional financing through various capital markets. Our principal uses of cash are debt repayments, capital expenditures,
asset acquisitions, operating costs, corporate expenses and distributions to our equity holders.

Cash Provided by Operations

.    Cash provided by operations decreased from $380 million in 2002 to $373 million in 2003. The
decrease in cash provided by operations in 2003 primarily reflects the overall reduction in hotel operating profit. Additionally, the 2002 cash provided by operations included a one-time, $50 million payment from Marriott International related to
negotiated changes in our management agreements with respect to working capital balances at our hotels. Previously, we had recorded this amount in our balance sheet as “due from managers.” There was no income statement impact of this
payment.

Cash Provided by or Used in Investing
Activities

.    Cash used in investing activities decreased from $222 million in 2002 to $156 million in 2003. Activity for 2003 primarily included net proceeds of $184 million from the sale of eight hotels, property insurance
proceeds of $185 million for the New York World Trade Center hotel, the acquisition of the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa for $321 million, and capital expenditures of $201 million as discussed above in “Capital Expenditures.” The 2002
cash used in investing activities included a one-time $75 million payment from Marriott International related to negotiated changes in our management agreements with respect to furniture, fixture and equipment escrow funds for our hotels. There was
no income statement impact of this payment from Marriott International.


The following table summarizes significant investing activities that have been completed since the
beginning of fiscal year 2002 (in millions):

(1)

Investment price includes the consolidation of $95 million of mortgage debt.

(2)

Investment price includes the assumption of $97 million of mortgage debt.

As discussed previously, we continue to pursue opportunities to dispose of non-core assets and expect to complete the sale of two additional non-core
properties by the end of the first quarter of 2004. Similar to the hotels already sold in 2003 and the four properties disposed of in the first quarter of 2004, the hotels currently under contract for sale are generally smaller hotels in secondary
markets with lower growth prospects. We believe that, if consummated, sales of non-core properties could result in proceeds of up to $500 million in 2004. If the proceeds from these sales are used to retire debt, operating profit will decrease, but
net income may improve based on the amount of the reduction in future interest payments. Similarly, if these funds are used to purchase new hotels or reinvest in existing hotels, future operating profit and net income may improve. However, there can
be no assurance that operating profit or net income will improve.

Cash Used in and Provided by Financing Activities

.    Cash provided by financing activities for 2003 was $186 million, compared to cash used in financing activities of $149 million for 2002. Significant financing
activities during 2003 included two separate issuances of common stock by Host Marriott totaling 51 million shares for net proceeds of approximately $501 million. The proceeds were contributed to Host LP which used a significant portion of the
proceeds to finance the acquisition of the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa. Host LP also issued $725 million in 7


/


% Series J senior notes due in 2013. The net proceeds were used to redeem $429 million of our existing 7


/


% Series A senior notes due in 2005 and $282 million of our 8.45% Series C senior notes due in 2008 on December 8, 2003. The terms of the Series A and C senior notes required that we pay a premium in exchange for the right to retire
this debt in advance of its maturity date. In conjunction with the redemption, we recorded a loss of approximately $28 million for the payment of the premium and the acceleration of the related deferred financing fees in the fourth quarter of 2003.

During December 2003, we announced the
settlement of all outstanding matters related to the New York Marriott World Trade Center and Financial Center hotels with our insurer, Marriott International and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. As a result of this settlement, we
received net proceeds of approximately $372 million, substantially all of which were used to repay debt. During the fourth quarter, we used the proceeds to repay the $65 million mortgage debt on the World Trade Center hotel and made a partial
prepayment of $33 million of mortgage debt on our Canadian properties. The remainder of the proceeds was used


in the first quarter of 2004 for a partial prepayment of $44 million of debt secured by mortgages on two Ritz-Carlton properties and to retire the remaining
outstanding Series C senior notes of approximately $218 million. In conjunction with the redemption of the Series C senior notes, we will record a loss of approximately $11 million for the payment of the call premium and the acceleration of the
related deferred financing fees in the first quarter of 2004.

The following table summarizes significant financing activity, except for the credit facility, payment of distributions and non-cash equity and derivative transactions completed since the beginning of fiscal year 2002 (in millions):

Financial Condition

Debt and Effect of Financial Covenants

As of December 31, 2003, our debt totaled $5.5 billion (as described fully
in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements). As of December 31, 2003, the weighted average interest rate of our debt was approximately 7.7% and the average maturity was 5.5 years. Additionally, approximately 85% of debt had a fixed rate of
interest. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the outstanding senior notes balance includes $37 million and $40 million, respectively, of fair value adjustments for interest rate swap agreements.


Over time, we expect to decrease the proportion of fixed rate debt in our capital structure to 75% to 80%
of our total debt, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result on terms acceptable to us. We may do this through the use of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps or through the periodic refinancings
of fixed rate mortgage debt with floating rate debt. In furtherance of this objective, in August 2003 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements maturing in October 2007. Under the agreements, we receive fixed rate payments at 9.25% and make
floating rate payments based on six-month LIBOR plus 590 basis points (7.08% at December 31, 2003) on a combined notional amount of $242 million. These agreements have the effect of swapping our interest obligations on $242 million in principal
amount of 9.25% Series G senior notes to a floating rate of interest. In addition, in September 2003 we refinanced the $95 million mortgage debt secured by the JW Marriott in Washington, D.C. with an $88 million floating-rate mortgage loan with an
interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 210 basis points (3.3% at December 31, 2003.) In connection with the refinancing, we also purchased an interest rate cap, which has the effect of limiting the interest rate on the new floating rate mortgage loan
to not greater than 8.1% for the first two years of the loan. We may continue to enter into similar swaps or refinancings in the future. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a discussion of our sensitivity
to interest rates.

Credit Facility and Senior Notes
Covenants

.    Under the terms of our senior notes indenture and the credit facility, our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including an
EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio (as defined in the senior notes indenture) for Host LP of at least 2.0 to 1.0. We do not currently meet this interest coverage ratio. As a result, Host Marriott is limited in its ability to pay dividends on its
common and preferred stock, except to the extent necessary to maintain Host Marriott’s status as a REIT. In addition, we cannot incur indebtedness, except indebtedness specifically permitted under our senior notes indenture and the credit
facility, which in both cases mainly consist of borrowings under the credit facility and borrowings in connection with a refinancing of existing debt. For this reason, we generally cannot currently finance significant capital expenditures,
acquisitions or other growth through the issuance of new debt (other than borrowings under our credit facility). Accordingly, we would expect that until such time as our coverage ratio is greater than 2.0 to 1.0 our acquisitions or other growth will
generally be funded with available cash, the proceeds of asset sales or the issuance of additional equity.

Under our credit facility, we are required to use the proceeds of asset sales to reinvest in our assets, acquire new properties or to permanently reduce
the revolving loan commitment in effect at the time. In general, in the event that we consummate asset sales during any 12 month period that generate net proceeds in excess of 1% of our total assets (calculated using undepreciated real estate
assets), the revolving loan commitment will automatically be reduced by the amount of such proceeds to the extent that such proceeds are not reinvested or committed to be reinvested in our business within 364 days following the date the 1% threshold
is exceeded. The May 2003 amendment to the credit facility provided for certain exceptions to this general rule. For instance, when the revolving loan commitment is $250 million or less, further revolving loan commitment reductions occur with
respect to asset sales proceeds that are not reinvested only to the extent that amounts are outstanding under the credit facility. If no amounts are outstanding, a commitment reduction can be avoided if we achieve commensurate reductions in the
amount of our secured indebtedness or indebtedness under our senior notes indenture.

Our senior notes indenture has parallel requirements with respect to asset sales in excess of 1% of our total assets during any 12 month period. Under our senior notes indenture, amounts in excess of the 1% threshold
must be either reinvested in the business or used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility (our availability under the credit facility would also be permanently reduced by the amount of the repayment). If asset sale proceeds are not
used for either of these purposes, then we are required to offer to repurchase our senior notes at par with the excess sale proceeds.

In November 2003, we crossed the 1% threshold. As a result, the revolving loan commitment would automatically be reduced unless we reinvest or commit to
reinvest the net sale proceeds from all such dispositions by November 2004. Based on investments we have made (in particular, the acquisition of the Hyatt


Regency Maui Resort and Spa on November 13, 2003 for $321 million), as well as other planned capital expenditures, the dispositions to date will not result
in a reduction of the credit facility availability. We will, however, continue to be subject to these credit facility commitment reduction provisions and senior notes indenture requirements with respect to future dispositions, if any.

Mortgage Debt Covenants

.    Substantially all of
our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of February 15, 2004, we have 29 assets that are secured by mortgage debt. Eleven of these
assets are secured by mortgage debt that have restrictive covenants which require the mortgage servicer or lender to retain and hold in escrow the cash flow after debt service when it declines below specified operating levels. The effect of these
covenants is discussed below:

·

Eight of our hotel properties secure a $591 million mortgage loan that is the sole asset of a trust that issued commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, which we refer to as
the CMBS Loan. The hotels, which comprise what we refer to as the CMBS Portfolio, are listed in the notes to our financial statements. The CMBS Loan contains a provision that requires the mortgage servicer to retain certain excess cash flow from the
CMBS Portfolio after payment of debt service (approximately $64 million) if net cash flow after payment of taxes, insurance, ground rent and reserves for furniture, fixtures and equipment for the trailing twelve months declines below $96 million.
Annual debt service is $64 million. As a result of the effect of the weak economy on our operations, this provision was triggered beginning in the third quarter of 2002 and will remain in effect until the CMBS Portfolio generates the necessary
minimum cash flow for two consecutive quarters, at which point, the cash that has been escrowed will be returned to us. As of December 31, 2003, approximately $15 million of cash has been escrowed. We anticipated that additional cash of
approximately $20 million will be required to be escrowed in 2004. We do not expect cash flows from the CMBS Portfolio to be at the level required to trigger the release of the escrow until we have a significant improvement in operations. As such,
additional amounts will be escrowed, and these amounts may be significant.

·

We currently have a $55 million loan secured by three of our Canadian properties that matures in 2006. This loan was originally entered into during August 2001 for $97 million and
was secured by all four of our Canadian properties. As a result of a decline in operations at these properties in late 2001 and 2002, we were required under the loan agreement to escrow operating cash from the hotels after the payment of debt
service. In April 2003, approximately $7 million of the cash escrowed in accordance with the loan was applied to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness and approximately $2 million was released to us. Because operating results at our three
properties located in Toronto had not yet fully recovered from the impact which SARS had on travel to this city, we entered into an agreement with our lenders in July 2003 to modify certain covenants so that we would not be required to make
additional prepayments at that time. The terms of the modification required us to provide additional collateral of $10 million in cash and pay an additional 25 basis points of interest on the loan.

As this loan is denominated in United States dollars and the functional
currency of the properties is Canadian dollars, we entered into currency forward contracts to buy U.S. dollars at a fixed price at the time we entered into the loan. These forward contracts hedge the currency exposure of converting Canadian dollars
into U.S. dollars on a monthly basis to cover debt service payments, including the original final balloon payment of approximately $84 million. These contracts had been designated as cash flow hedges of the debt service and balloon payment and were
recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with offsetting changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. In December 2003, we made a partial repayment of approximately $33 million of the Canadian mortgage loan in addition to the April
2003 repayment mentioned above. We also terminated foreign currency forward contracts in an amount equal to the aggregate repayment. As a result of these prepayments, the forward currency exchange contracts were deemed ineffective hedges for
accounting purposes and we recorded a loss on the contracts of approximately $18 million in 2003. We will record the change in the fair value of the outstanding forward currency contracts in operations each period. In conjunction with the December
2003 prepayment,


one of the hotels and the $10 million deposit was released from the collateral. The current loan is still subject to the escrow provisions and we anticipate
that additional cash of approximately $4 million will be required to be escrowed in 2004.

Credit Ratings

Currently, we have $3.2 billion of senior notes outstanding that are rated by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s. As a result of our significantly reduced operating levels over the past few years, the ratings on
our senior notes have been downgraded or placed on negative credit watch. On February 13, 2003, Standard and Poor’s downgraded its rating on our senior debt from BB- to B+. At the same time Standard & Poor’s also downgraded its rating
on Host Marriott’s preferred stock from B- to CCC+. On August 6, 2003, Moody’s announced that it had placed its Ba3 rating of our senior unsecured debt and its B3 rating of Host Marriott’s preferred stock under review for possible
downgrade. On December 4, 2003, Moody’s concluded its review and changed its ratings outlook on our senior notes and Host Marriott’s preferred stock to stable. While we have no senior note maturities until 2006, if our operations were to
decline further, or if our credit ratios do not otherwise improve, the ratings on our senior notes could be further reduced. If we were unable to subsequently improve our credit ratings, our cost to issue additional senior notes, either in
connection with a refinancing or otherwise, or to issue additional preferred stock would likely increase.

Dividend Policy

Host Marriott is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income in order to qualify as a REIT, including taxable income we
recognize for tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive corresponding cash. Funds used by Host Marriott to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock are provided through distributions from Host LP. For every share of common and
preferred stock of Host Marriott, Host LP has issued to Host Marriott a corresponding common OP unit and preferred OP unit. As of February 15, 2004, Host Marriott is the owner of substantially all of the preferred OP units and approximately 93% of
the common OP units. The remaining 7% of the common OP units are held by various third-party limited partners. As a result of the minority position in Host LP common OP units, these holders share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by
Host LP. As a general rule, when Host Marriott pays a common or preferred dividend, Host LP pays an equivalent per unit distribution on all common or corresponding preferred OP units. For example, if Host Marriott paid a five cent per share dividend
on its common stock, it would be based on payment of a five cent per common OP unit distribution by Host LP to Host Marriott and all other common OP unit holders.

Our failure to meet the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio in our senior notes indenture and credit facility, as previously
discussed, restricts our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred equity, except to the extent necessary to maintain Host Marriott’s status as a REIT. Required income distributions for 2002 were satisfied in part by the payment of
dividends on the preferred stock in 2002 and in the first three quarters of 2003.

Taxable income generated by the insurance recovery on the World Trade Center and Financial Center hotels was sufficient to allow Host Marriott to pay the preferred stock dividend for the fourth quarter of 2003. We
expect that the taxable income generated by the insurance recovery will also be sufficient to allow Host Marriott to pay up to the first three quarters of preferred stock dividends in 2004. Preferred dividend payments beyond those supported by the
taxable income generated by this settlement will depend on, among other factors, taxable income or loss from operations in 2004 or our ability to meet a minimum EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio (both as required by the senior notes indenture).

Host Marriott did not pay a dividend on its common stock (and,
correspondingly, Host LP did not make a distribution on its common OP units) in 2002 and 2003. Host Marriott does not currently expect to pay a meaningful common dividend for 2004 other than to satisfy any remaining 2003 income distribution
requirements. The decision to reinstate the common dividend (including the amount of any such dividend) will be made by the Board of Directors and will depend on several factors, including those described above for distributions on the preferred
stock, as well as our liquidity and any accrued unpaid dividends on the preferred stock.


Investments in Affiliates

We have made investments in certain ventures which we do not consolidate and, accordingly, are accounted for under the
equity method of accounting in accordance with our accounting policies as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Over the past several years we have actively marketed and sold our interests in various partnerships which are no
longer consistent with our core portfolio. As a result, except for the partnerships described below any remaining interests are insignificant and/or the partnerships have no recourse to the company. We have included the table below and the following
discussion to provide investors with additional information on these investments. Investments in affiliates consist of the following at December 31, 2003:

We and Marriott
International each own a 50% interest in CBM Joint Venture, which owns, through two limited partnerships, 120 Courtyard by Marriott properties totaling 17,550 rooms. The joint venture, CBM Joint Venture LLC, has approximately $901 million of debt.
This debt consists of first mortgage loans secured by the properties owned by each of the two partnerships, senior notes secured by the ownership interest in one partnership and mezzanine debt. The mezzanine debt is an obligation of a subsidiary of
the joint venture and the lender is an affiliate of Marriott International. None of the debt is recourse to, or guaranteed by, us or any of our subsidiaries. RevPAR at the Courtyard hotels declined 3.7% for 2003 when compared to the same period in
2002. Based on our current forecasts for the full year 2004, the hotels in one of these two partnerships are not expected to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund the partnership’s debt service obligations. To the extent that
there is insufficient cash flow to fund its debt service obligations, the partnership will continue to make use of (i) available unrestricted cash balances, (ii) a senior note debt service reserve, (iii) certain rights to require repayment to the
partnership of a portion of ground rent and certain management fees it has previously paid to Marriott International, and (iv) subordination provisions for current payments in its ground leases and management agreements to cover any shortfall. As of
December 31, 2003, the joint venture has deferred a total of $3.8 million in ground rent and base management fees. Interest does not accrue on such deferred amounts, but these amounts must be repaid prior to distributions to equity holders. In
addition, we anticipate that the joint venture will continue to defer interest payments on the mezzanine debt for at least the first half of 2004. As of December 31, 2003, the joint venture has deferred $28 million of interest payments on the
mezzanine debt. Deferral of these interest payments is not a default under the mezzanine debt agreements. To the extent deferred, unpaid mezzanine debt interest amounts have been added to principal and earn interest at 13%. As of December 31, 2003,
the partnerships and the joint venture maintained aggregate unrestricted cash balances of approximately $17 million. We did not receive any cash distributions from this investment during 2003 or 2002.

We currently have a 49% limited partner interest in Tiburon Golf Ventures,
L.P., which owns the Greg Norman-designed golf club surrounding The Ritz-Carlton, Naples Golf Resort. Cash distributions from this investment were $1 million in both 2003 and 2002.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are party to various transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities (which we
refer to as “off-balance sheet arrangements”) under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees. As of December 31, 2003, we are party to the following material off-balance sheet arrangements:

Tax Sharing Arrangements

.    Under tax sharing
agreements with former affiliated companies (such as Marriott International, Host Marriott Services Corporation and Barceló Crestline Corporation (formerly Crestline


Capital Corporation)), we are obligated to pay certain taxes (Federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) relating to
periods in which the companies were affiliated with us. For example, a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us. This adjustment could produce a material tax
liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement. In addition, under the partnership agreement between Host Marriott and Host LP, Host LP is obligated to pay certain taxes (Federal, state, local and foreign, including any
related interest and penalties) incurred by Host Marriott, as well as any liabilities the IRS successfully may assert against Host Marriott. We do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing arrangement to be material.

Tax Indemnification Agreements.

For reasons
relating to tax considerations of the former and current owners of nine hotels, we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels, or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel. These agreements require
that we indemnify the owners for their tax consequences resulting from our selling the hotel or refinancing the mortgage debt during the period under the agreement. We have also agreed not to sell more than 50% of the original allocated value
attributable to the former owners of a portfolio of 11 additional hotels, or to take other actions that would result in the recognition and allocation of gain to the former owners of such hotels for income tax purposes. Because the timing of these
potential transactions is within our control, we believe that the likelihood of any material indemnification to be remote and therefore not material to our financial statements.

Guarantees

.    We have certain guarantees, which consist of commitments we have made to third
parties for leases or debt, that are not on our books due to various dispositions, spin-offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party. We consider the
likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote. The largest guarantees (by dollar amount) are listed below:

·

We remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non-lodging properties. These primarily represent divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee
of rental payments. The aggregate amount of these guaranteed payments is approximately $40 million as of December 31, 2003.

·

In 1997, we owned Leisure Park Venture Limited Partnership, which owns and operates a senior living facility. We spun-off the partnership as part of Crestline in the REIT
conversion, but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to $14.7 million of municipal bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority through their maturity in 2027. However, to the extent we are
required to make any payments under the guarantee, we have been indemnified by Crestline, who, in turn, is indemnified by the current owner of the facility.

Information on other guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in Note 17 to our consolidated
financial statements.

Contractual Obligations

The table below summarizes our obligations for
principal payments on our debt, future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases and projected capital expenditures, each as of December 31, 2003 (in millions):


(1)

The amounts shown include amortization of principal and debt maturities on our debt as well as discounts of $4 million on our senior notes.

(2)

Future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants of $2 million, payable to us under non-cancelable subleases. The lease
payments also include interest payable of $3 million.

(3)

Future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the HPT subleases of $27 million and $618 million, respectively,
payable to us under non-cancelable subleases.

(4)

Our purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels. Under our contracts, we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years
and some of the current year amount reflects prior year contracts that were deferred or not completed. See “Capital Expenditures.”

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Host Marriott and all consolidated subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ
from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business
judgment or make significant estimates:

·

Impairment testing

.    We are required by GAAP to record an impairment charge when we believe that one or more of our hotels has been impaired, whereby,
future undiscounted cash flows for the hotel would be less than the net book value of the hotel. For impaired assets, we record an impairment charge when a property’s fair value less selling costs is less than its net book value. We test for
impairment in several situations in accordance with SFAS 144, including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows, when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously
estimated useful life, as well as whenever an asset is classified as “held for sale” or events or changes in circumstances indicate that a hotel’s net book value may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the impairment of our
hotels, we make many assumptions and estimates, including:

·

projected cash flows,

·

holding period,

·

expected useful life

·

future capital expenditures

·

fair values, including consideration of capitalization rates, discount rates and comparable selling prices

Changes in these estimates, assumptions, future changes in economic
conditions or property-level results could require us to record additional impairment charges, which would be reflected in operations in the future.

·

Classification of Assets as “Held for Sale.”

We classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following
conditions are met:

·

our Board of Directors has approved the sale (to the extent the dollar magnitude of the sale requires Board approval);

·

a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed;

·

the buyer has committed a significant amount of non-refundable cash; and

·

no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner.


To the extent a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower
than the net book value of the property, we will record an impairment loss. See the discussion above concerning the use of estimates and judgments in determining fair values for impairment tests.

·

Depreciation and Amortization Expense.

Depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold
improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. The lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets, as
well as specific market and economic conditions. While management believes its estimates are reasonable, a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels.

·

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets.

We have approximately $90 million, net of a valuation allowance of $9 million, in consolidated deferred tax assets as
of December 31, 2003. SFAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes, the objectives of which are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current
year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company’s financial statements or tax returns. We have considered various factors, including future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the $90
million in deferred tax assets in the future. When a determination is made that all, or a portion, of the deferred tax assets may not be realized, an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period.

·

Valuation of Foreign Currency and Derivative Contracts.

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments. We have three interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2003. Our interest rate swap agreements with a fair market value of $37 million as of December 31,
2003 have been designated as fair value hedges, as described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if a particular interest rate swap does not qualify as highly
effective, any change in the fair value of the derivative used as a hedge would be reflected in current earnings. Should any change in management strategy, or any other circumstance, cause an existing highly-effective hedge to become ineffective,
the accumulated loss or gain in the value of the derivative instrument since its inception may be reclassified from the shareholders’ equity section of the balance sheet to current net income. We also have two interest rate cap agreements that
are fair valued each quarter and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income. We also have several foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we previously used to hedge the mortgage loan on our Canadian properties. The
hedge has been deemed ineffective for accounting purposes. See the discussion in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” We estimate the fair value of all of these instruments through the use of third party
valuations, which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments. The variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates
derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves. The values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change. Any event that impacts the level of actual and expected
future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations. The fair value of our existing foreign currency and derivatives is likely to fluctuate materially from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening
terms to maturity.

·

Consolidation Policies.

Judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the
evaluation of control, including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights, as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests. We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” in 2003. Currently, we have investments in entities that in the aggregate own 124 hotel


properties and other investments which we record using the equity method of accounting. These entities are considered to be voting interest entities. The
debt on these investments is non-recourse to the company and the effect of their operations on our results of operations is not material. While we do not believe we are required to consolidate any of our current partnerships or joint ventures, if we
were required to do so, then all of the results of operations and the assets and liabilities would be included in our financial statements. For further detail on our unconsolidated entities see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.

Lodging Statistics

Reporting Periods for Hotel Operating Statistics and Comparable Hotel Results

The results we report are based on results of our hotels
reported to us by our hotel managers. Our hotel managers use different reporting periods. Marriott International, Inc., the manager of the majority of our properties, uses a year ending on the Friday closest to December 31 and reports twelve weeks
of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its Marriott-managed hotels. In contrast, other managers of our hotels, such as Hyatt, report results on a monthly basis. Host Marriott,
as a REIT, is required by tax laws to report results on a calendar year. As a result, we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by Marriott International modified so that our fiscal year always ends on December 31 to comply with REIT rules. Our
first three quarters of operations end on the same day as Marriott International but our fourth quarter ends on December 31.

Two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are: (1) quarterly start dates will usually differ between years, except for the first quarter
which always commences on January 1, and (2) our first and fourth quarters of operations and year-to-date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years. For example, the third quarter of 2003 ended on September 12
and the third quarter of 2002 ended on September 6, though both quarters reflect twelve weeks of operations. In contrast, fourth quarter results for 2003 reflected 110 days of operations, while our fourth quarter results for 2002 reflected 116 days
of operations.

In contrast to the reporting periods for our
statement of operations, our hotel operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) are always reported based on the reporting cycle used by Marriott International for our Marriott-managed hotels. This facilitates
year-to-year comparisons, as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year (except in the case of fourth quarters comprised of seventeen weeks, such as fiscal year 2002, versus sixteen weeks).
This means, however, that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics may differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year. For the hotel operating
statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein:

·

Hotel results for fiscal year 2003 reflect 52 weeks of operations for the period from January 4, 2003 to January 2, 2004 for our Marriott-managed properties and results from January
1, 2003 to December 31, 2003 for operations of all other hotels which report results on a monthly basis.

·

Hotel results for fiscal year 2002 reflect 53 weeks of operations for the period from December 29, 2001 to January 3, 2003 for our Marriott-managed hotels and results from January
1, 2002 to December 31, 2002 for operations of all other hotels which report results on a monthly basis.

·

Hotel results for the fourth quarter of 2003 reflect 16 weeks of operations for the period from September 13, 2003 to January 2, 2004 for our Marriott-managed hotels and results
from September 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003 for operations of all other hotels which report results on a monthly basis.

·

Hotel results for the fourth quarter of 2002 reflect 17 weeks of operations for the period from September 7, 2002 to January 3, 2003 for our Marriott-managed hotels and results from
September 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002 for operations of all other hotels which report results on a monthly basis.


Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics

We present certain operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results
(revenues, expenses and adjusted operating profit) for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis. We define our comparable hotels as full-service properties (i) that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are
included in our consolidated results, whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations, for the entirety of the operating periods being compared, and (ii) that have not sustained substantial property damage or undergone large-scale
capital projects during the reporting periods being compared. For 2003 and 2002, we consider 112 of our portfolio of 117 full-service hotels owned on December 31, 2003 to be comparable hotels. The operating results of the following hotels that we
owned as of December 31, 2003 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

·

The New York Marriott Financial Center (substantially damaged in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and re-opened in January 2002);

·

The Ritz-Carlton, Naples Golf Resort (opened in January 2002);

·

The Boston Marriott Copley Place (acquired in June 2002);

·

The JW Marriott, Washington, D.C. (consolidated in our financial statements beginning in the second quarter of 2003); and

·

The Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa (acquired in November 2003).

In addition, the operating results of the eight hotels we disposed of in 2003 and the one hotel we disposed of in 2002 are also not included in comparable
hotel results for the periods presented herein. Moreover, because these statistics and operating results are for our full-service hotel properties, they exclude results for our non-hotel properties and leased limited-service hotels.


Hotel Operating Statistics

The following tables set forth performance information for our full-service hotels by geographic region for 2003 and 2002
for our comparable hotels, as well as all full-service hotels.

The number of properties and the room count reflect all consolidated properties as of December 31, 2003. However, the operating statistics include the results of operations for the
nine properties sold in 2003 and 2002 prior to their disposition and the results of operations of properties acquired subsequent to the date of their acquisition.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented
in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) Funds From Operations (FFO) per diluted share, and (ii) Comparable Hotel Operating Results. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why
we believe they are useful measures of our performance.

FFO
per Diluted Share

We present FFO per diluted share as a
non-GAAP measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate FFO per diluted share for a given operating period as our FFO (defined as set forth below) for such period divided by the
number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate,
the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization and after


adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive
securities, including the payment of preferred stock dividends, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines.

We believe that FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of FFO per diluted share, when
combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based
on historical cost accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance, we believe that such measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs, even though FFO per
diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by
NAREIT in its April 2002 “White Paper on Funds From Operations,” since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate
companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the definition of FFO in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

We calculate FFO per diluted share, in accordance with standards established
by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although FFO per diluted share is a
useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations, or any
other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the FFO per diluted
share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated
statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures.
Additionally, FFO per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, FFO per diluted share does not
measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to shareholders’ benefit.

Comparable Hotel Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our full-service hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses and adjusted operating profit, on a comparable hotel,
or “same store” basis as supplemental information for investors. Our comparable hotel operating results present operating results for full-service hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any
acquisitions or dispositions, significant property damage or large scale capital improvements incurred during these periods. We present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate-level costs and expenses related to our capital
structure, as well as depreciation and amortization. We eliminate corporate-level costs and expenses to arrive at property-level results because we believe property-level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing
operating performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management in running our business on a property-level basis. We eliminate depreciation and amortization, because even though depreciation and amortization are property-level expenses,
these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values have historically
risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.


As a result of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization,
the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for
these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of
which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our
hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of
operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors, such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a “same
store” supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels, as these decisions are based on data for
individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results. For these reasons, we believe that comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful
information to investors and management.


The following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable hotels for
fiscal years 2003 and 2002.

(b)

FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT is adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans,
those preferred OP units held by minority partners, other minority interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interest to common OP units and the Convertible Preferred Securities of Host Marriott. No effect is shown for
securities if they are anti-dilutive.


For 2003, the FFO per diluted share includes the following items:

·

As a result of the World Trade Center insurance settlement in the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a gain of approximately $212 million, which is comprised of $156 million in
post-2003 business interruption proceeds and $56 million from the disposition of the hotel. We excluded the $56 million gain on disposition from FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition of FFO.

·

In conjunction with the redemption of $711 million of our senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2003, we incurred a total of approximately $28 million of expense related to the call
premiums paid and the acceleration of related deferred financing fees. We also incurred approximately $5 million of incremental interest expense during the redemption call period. In addition, we incurred approximately $2.3 million of call premiums
and accelerated deferred financing fees related to a $71 million senior notes redemption in the third quarter of 2003.

·

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we made a partial repayment of the Canadian mortgage debt, which resulted in the related forward currency contracts hedge being deemed ineffective for
accounting purposes. Accordingly, we recorded an approximate $17 million decrease in net income and FFO in the fourth quarter in addition to the approximate $1 million recorded in the first three quarters of 2003.

·

Approximately $9.6 million of other income in the third quarter of 2003 from the settlement of a claim that we brought against our directors’ and officers’ insurance
carriers for reimbursement of defense costs and settlement payments incurred in resolving a series of related actions brought against us and Marriott International that arose from the sale of certain limited partnership units to investors prior to
1993. The settlement amount, net of taxes of approximately $2.4 million, totaled $7.2 million.

New Accounting Pronouncements

The FASB recently issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,” or SFAS 150. This statement requires issuers to classify as liabilities (or assets in some
circumstances) three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer. Previously, many such instruments had been classified as equity. A freestanding financial instrument is an instrument that is entered into
separately and apart from any of the entity’s other financial instruments or equity transactions, or that is entered into in conjunction with some other transaction and is legally detachable and separately exercisable, such as certain put and
call options. These provisions are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise are effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. On October 8, 2003, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance with respect to SFAS 150 that issuers whose financial statements include consolidated ventures with finite lives should reflect any minority interests in such consolidated ventures as a
liability on the issuer’s financial statements presented at its fair value as of the applicable balance sheet date. Under SFAS 150, any fluctuation in the fair value of the minority interest from period to period would be recorded on the
issuers financial statements as interest expense for the change in the fair value of the liability. As a result of applying SFAS 150 in accordance with this guidance from the FASB, in our third quarter 2003 Form 10-Q we recorded a loss from a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $24 million. Additionally, we included in our liabilities as of September 12, 2003, minority interests with a fair value of $112 million.

On November 7, 2003, the FASB issued a FASB Staff Position (FSP) 150-3
indefinitely deferring the application of a portion of SFAS 150 with respect to minority interests in consolidated ventures entered into prior to November 5, 2003, effectively reversing its guidance of October 8, 2003. In accordance with the FSP
150-3, in the fourth quarter of 2003 we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle reversing the impact of our adoption of SFAS 150 with respect to consolidated ventures with finite lives.

We adopted Financial Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”) in 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to

FIN 46, which we refer to as FIN 46R. Under this


guidance, our limited purpose trust subsidiary that was formed to issue trust-preferred securities (the “Convertible Preferred Securities Trust”)
is considered to be a special purpose entity because its activities are so restricted that Host Marriott, the sole equity holder, lacks the ability to make decisions about the Convertible Preferred Securities Trust’s activities through voting
or similar rights. The transition guidance set forth in FIN 46R allows us to apply the provisions of either FIN 46 or FIN 46R to special purpose entities in which we have a variable interest at December 31, 2003. We account for our Convertible
Preferred Securities Trust on a consolidated basis as of December 31, 2003 since we are the primary beneficiary under FIN 46 based on our fixed price call option and the holders of the Convertible Preferred Securities are widely dispersed and
unrelated.

We are required to apply the provisions of FIN 46R
to the Convertible Preferred Securities Trust in the first quarter of 2004. Under FIN 46R we will not be the primary beneficiary and accordingly, we are required to deconsolidate the accounts of the Convertible Preferred Securities Trust. This will
result in our recognizing the $492 million in debentures issued by Convertible Preferred Securities Trust as debt, eliminating the $475 million of Convertible Preferred Securities currently classified in the mezzanine section of our balance sheet
and recognizing, as an equity investment, the $17 million invested in the Convertible Preferred Securities Trust. Additionally, we would classify the related dividend payments as interest expense.


QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Sensitivity

The table below provides information about our derivative financial
instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps and debt obligations. For debt obligations, the table presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest
rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the
yield curve as of December 31, 2003. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average variable rates are presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is our reporting currency. The
interest rate swaps and caps that we have entered into are strictly to hedge interest rate risk and not for trading purposes.

(1)

Excludes the fair market value of the swaps which were $37 million as of December 31, 2003.

As of December 31, 2003, approximately 85% of our debt bears interest at fixed rates. This debt structure largely mitigates
the impact of changes in interest rates. We have some financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including our credit facility. The interest rate on our credit facility is based on a spread over LIBOR, ranging from 2.5%
to 3.75%. There were no amounts outstanding on our credit facility at December 31, 2003.

Over time, we expect to decrease the proportion of fixed rate debt on our capital structure to 75% to 80% of our total debt, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result on terms
acceptable to us. In furtherance of this objective, we have entered into three interest rate swaps effectively converting $692 million of fixed rate payments to floating rate payments based on a spread to LIBOR.

On December 20, 2001, we entered into a 5-year interest rate swap agreement,
which was effective on January 15, 2002 and matures in January 2007, effectively converting our Series I senior notes to floating rate debt. Under the swap, we receive fixed-rate payments of 9.5% and pay floating-rate payments based on one-month
LIBOR plus 450 basis points on a $450 million notional amount. We have designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge for both financial reporting and tax purposes and the amounts paid or received under the swap agreement will be recognized
over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense. Changes in the fair value of the swap and the Series I notes are reflected in the balance sheet as offsetting changes and have no income statement effect. The fair value of the
interest rate swap at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 was $34.5 million and $40.3 million, respectively, which is included in the senior notes line item on our consolidated balance sheet.


On August 21, 2003, we entered into two four-year interest rate swap agreements, which mature October
2007, effectively converting our Series G senior notes to floating rate debt. Under the swaps, we receive fixed-rate payments of 9.25% and we make floating-rate payments based on six-month LIBOR plus 590 basis points on a $242 million notional
amount, which is equal to the current amount of outstanding Series G senior notes. We have designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for both financial reporting and tax purposes and the amounts paid or received under the swap
agreements will be recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. Changes in the fair value of the swaps and our Series G senior notes are reflected in the balance sheet as offsetting changes and have no income
statement effect. The fair value of the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2003 was $2.3 million, which is included in the senior notes line item on our consolidated balance sheet.

A change in LIBOR of 100 basis points will result in a $6.9 million increase or decrease in our annual interest expense as a
result of the combined $692 million in swap agreements.

In
addition, on September 9, 2003, we refinanced the $95 million fixed rate mortgage debt secured by the JW Marriott in Washington, D.C. with an $88 million floating-rate mortgage loan with an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 210 basis points. The
loan matures September 2005, but can be extended for up to three additional years subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We also have approximately $55 million of floating rate mortgage debt associated with three of our Canadian
properties. See below for further information.

Exchange Rate Sensitivity

Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Agreements

The table below summarizes information on instruments
and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates, including foreign currency forward exchange agreements as of December 31, 2003. The foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into are strictly to hedge foreign
currency risk and not for trading purposes. For foreign currency forward exchange agreements, the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. These notional amounts generally are
used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract.

On August 30, 2001,
our Canadian subsidiaries entered into a mortgage loan pursuant to which they borrowed $96.6 million (denominated in U.S. dollars) at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 2.75%. The weighted average interest rate for this mortgage loan was 4.5% and 4.6%,
respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. In addition, since the mortgage loan on these Canadian properties is denominated in U.S. Dollars and the functional currency of the Canadian subsidiaries is the Canadian Dollar, the
subsidiaries entered into currency forward contracts to hedge the currency exposure of converting Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars on a monthly basis to cover debt service payments. Up until April 2003 as discussed in “Debt”, these forward
exchange contracts had been designated as a cash flow hedges of the debt service payments, and the forward contracts were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with offsetting changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of
December 31, 2003, substantially all of the remaining forward contracts are not designated as a hedge and accordingly the change in fair value is recorded in operations each period. The fair value of the forward contracts was $(12.3) million and
$3.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002.


FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

In this report on Form 10-K and the information incorporated by reference herein we make some “forward-looking”
statements. These statements are included throughout this report on Form 10-K and the information incorporated by reference herein, including in the section entitled “Risk Factors” and relate to, among other things, analyses and other

RISK FACTORS

Prospective investors should carefully consider, among other factors, the material risks described below.

Financial Risks and Risks of Operation

We depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be
unable to access capital when necessary.

Unlike corporations, our ability to reduce our debt and finance our growth largely must be funded by external sources of capital because we are generally required to distribute to
our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income in order to qualify as a REIT, including taxable income we recognize for tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive corresponding cash. Our ability to access the external capital we
require could be hampered by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control, including, without limitation, declining general market conditions, unfavorable market perception of our growth potential, decreases in our current and
estimated future earnings, excessive cash distributions or decreases in the market price of our common stock. In addition, our ability to access additional capital may also be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness, which, among other
things, restricts our incurrence of debt and the payment of distributions. The occurrence of any of these above-mentioned factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms
that are acceptable to us or at all and the failure to obtain necessary external capital could have a material adverse affect our ability to finance our future growth.

We have substantial leverage.

We have a significant amount of indebtedness and that could have
important consequences. It currently requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures,
expansion efforts, distributions to our stockholders and other general purposes. Additionally, our high level of indebtedness could:

·

limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our indebtedness or obtain financing for expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate or business
purposes; or

·

affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions.

If our cash flow and working capital were not sufficient to fund our
expenditures or service our indebtedness, we would have to raise additional funds through:

·

the sale of our equity;

·

the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by the Operating Partnership; or

·

the sale of our assets.

We cannot assure you that any of these sources of funds would be available to us or, if available, would be on terms that we would find acceptable or in
amounts sufficient for us to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan.

Our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry.

The lodging industry has experienced a difficult period, and operations have
generally been declining for the past several years, which has caused declines in our revenue per available room, or RevPAR, and profit margins. The decline in the lodging industry has been attributed to a number of factors including a weak economy,
the effect of terror alerts and potential terrorist activity in the United States and the war in Iraq, all of which have changed the travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers. It is not clear whether these changes are permanent or
whether they will continue to evolve creating new opportunities or difficulties for the industry. Any forecast we make regarding our results of operations may be affected and can change based on the following risks:

·

changes in the national, regional and local economic climate;


·

reduced demand and increased operating costs and other conditions resulting from terrorist threats;

·

changes in business and leisure travel patterns;

·

local market conditions such as an oversupply of hotel rooms or a reduction in lodging demand;

·

the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to our competition;

·

the performance of the managers of our hotels;

·

changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors; and

·

unionization of the labor force at our hotels.

Our expenses may not decrease if our revenue drops

.    Many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels, such
as debt payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the property. Because of weak economic conditions over the
last several years, particularly in the lodging industry, we have been working with our managers to reduce the operating costs of our hotels. While we have achieved reductions in operating costs as a result of these efforts, further cost reductions
could be difficult to achieve if operating levels continue to decline. Some of the cost reduction efforts undertaken may eventually need to be reversed even if operations remain at reduced levels. Regardless of these efforts to reduce costs, our
expenses will be affected by inflationary increases, and in the case of certain costs, such as wages, benefits and insurance, may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. Our managers may be unable to offset any such increased expenses with
higher room rates. Any of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures could adversely affect the growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties.

Our revenues may be affected by increased use of reservation systems based
on the Internet.

Although a majority of the rooms sold on the Internet are sold through websites maintained by our managers, a growing number of rooms are also sold through independent Internet sites. These independent
Internet sites often purchase rooms at a negotiated discount from participating properties, which could result in lower average room rates compared to the room rates offered by the manager on its website. While we do not believe that price is the
only factor considered when choosing our properties, if the room rate available to consumers using the independent Internet sites were to be significantly lower than those offered by our managers on their websites our results of operations could be
adversely affected.

Our ground lease payments may increase
faster than the revenues we receive on the hotels situated on the leased properties.

As of February 15, 2004, forty of our hotels are subject to ground leases. These ground leases generally require increases in ground rent
payments every five years. Our ability to service our debt could be adversely affected to the extent that our revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases. In addition, if we
were to sell a hotel encumbered by a ground lease, the buyer would have to assume the ground lease, which may result in a lower sales price.

We do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels.

Because federal income tax laws
restrict REITs and their subsidiaries from operating a hotel, we do not manage our hotels. Instead, we lease substantially all of our full-service properties to subsidiaries that qualify as a “taxable REIT subsidiaries” under applicable
REIT laws, and our taxable REIT subsidiaries retain third-party managers to manage our hotels pursuant to management agreements. Our income from the hotels may be adversely affected if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or
if they fail to maintain a quality brand name. While our taxable REIT subsidiaries monitor the hotel managers’ performance, we have limited specific recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not
performing adequately. In addition, from time to time, we have had, and continue to have, differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements. We generally resolve issues with
our managers through discussions and negotiations. However, if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate such a dispute.


Failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements could adversely affect our results of operations. In
addition, our hotel managers manage, and in some cases own or have invested in, hotels that compete with our hotels, which may result in conflicts of interest. As a result, our managers have in the past made and may in the future make decisions
regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interests.

The terms of our debt place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, reducing operational flexibility and creating default risks.

The documents governing the terms of the senior notes and
credit facility of the operating partnership contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. The activities upon which such restrictions exist include, but are not limited to:

·

acquisitions, mergers and consolidations;

·

the incurrence of additional debt;

·

the creation of liens;

·

the sale of assets;

·

capital expenditures;

·

raising capital from the issuance of certain types of mandatorily redeemable capital stock;

·

the payment of dividends; and

·

transactions with affiliates.

In addition, certain covenants in the credit facility of the operating partnership require it and our other subsidiaries to meet financial performance
tests. The restrictive covenants in the indenture, the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt (including our mortgage debt) will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in
activities that may be in our long-term best interest. The operating partnership’s failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a
substantial portion of our debt.

Our mortgage debt contains
provisions that may reduce our liquidity.

Certain of our mortgage debt requires that, to the extent cash flow from the hotels which secure such debt drops below stated levels, we escrow cash flow after the payment of debt
service until operations improve above the stated levels. In some cases, the escrowed amount may be applied to the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt. When such provisions are triggered, there can be no assurance that the affected properties
will achieve the minimum cash flow levels required to trigger a release of any escrowed funds. The amounts required to be escrowed may be material and may negatively affect our liquidity by limiting our access to cash flow after debt service from
these mortgaged properties.

Our future cash distributions
on preferred and common stock may be limited by the terms of our indebtedness and in addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be further limited by the terms of our preferred stock.

Under the terms of
our credit facility and our senior notes indenture, distributions to us by the operating partnership, which we depend upon in order to obtain the cash necessary to pay dividends, are permitted only to the extent that, at the time of the
distributions, the operating partnership can satisfy certain financial covenant tests and meet other requirements. For example, to make distributions to us, the operating partnership must in general have a consolidated coverage ratio (measuring the
pro forma ratio of its consolidated EBITDA to its consolidated interest expense) of 2.0 to 1.0 or greater. In addition, the aggregate amount of all of our debt, not including our Convertible Preferred Securities, must be less than or equal to 65% of
our total assets plus accumulated depreciation. If it fails to meet these requirements, the operating partnership will only be able to make cash distributions to us, subject to compliance with certain other requirements, in the amounts required to
maintain our qualification as a REIT. We are currently required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income to maintain our status as a REIT. As of December 31, 2003, we


remained under the 2.0 to 1.0 EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio. Accordingly, we will be able to pay dividends only to the extent that we have taxable income
and are required to make distributions to maintain our status as a REIT.

Under the terms of each of our class A, class B and class C cumulative redeemable preferred stock, we are not permitted to pay dividends on our common stock unless cumulative dividends have been paid (or funds for
payment have been set aside for payment) on each such class of preferred stock. Therefore, our ability to pay a dividend on our common stock is subject to our having previously paid all cumulative dividends accrued on our outstanding classes of
preferred stock. Our ability to pay dividends on our preferred and common stock is also limited by the terms of our Convertible Preferred Securities.

The payment of any dividends on either common or preferred shares depends on operating performance and its impact on current and prior year taxable income
and whether our EBITDA-to-interest ratio is below 2.0 to 1.0 coverage for the fiscal year. We cannot provide assurance that our operations will be sufficient to permit us to pay a dividend on our common stock or preferred stock.

Rating Agency downgrades may increase our cost of
capital.

Both our senior notes and our preferred stock are rated by independent rating agencies, such as Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. These rating agencies may elect to downgrade their ratings on our
corporate debt and our preferred stock at any time. These downgrades negatively affect our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of capital.

Our management agreements could impair the sale or financing of our hotels.

Under the terms of our management agreements, we
generally may not sell, lease or otherwise transfer the hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions. Our ability to finance or sell
any of the properties, depending upon the structure of such transactions, may require the manager’s consent. If, in these circumstances, the manager does not consent, we would be prohibited from taking actions in our best interest without
breaching the management agreement.

The acquisition
contracts relating to some hotels limit our ability to sell or refinance those hotels.

For reasons relating to tax considerations of the former and current owners of nine hotels, we have agreed to restrictions on selling
the hotels, or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel. We have also agreed not to sell more than 50% of the original allocated value attributable to the former owners of a portfolio of 11 additional
hotels, or to take other actions that would result in the recognition and allocation of gain to the former owners of such hotels for income tax purposes. We anticipate that, in specified circumstances, we may agree to similar restrictions in
connection with future hotel acquisitions. As a result, even if it were in our best interests to sell these hotels or repay or otherwise reduce the level of the mortgage debt on such hotels, it may be difficult or costly to do so during their
respective lock-out periods.

We may be unable to sell
properties because real estate investments are illiquid.

Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. The
inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to service our debt. In addition, there are limitations under the federal tax laws applicable to REITs that
may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets.

We depend on our key personnel.

Our success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. None of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not
maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers. We cannot assure you that these key personnel will remain employed by us. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services
could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance.


Litigation judgments or settlements could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition.

We are a party to various lawsuits, including lawsuits relating to our conversion into a REIT. While we and the other defendants to such lawsuits believe all of the lawsuits in which we are a defendant are
without merit and we are vigorously defending against such claims, we can give no assurance as to the outcome of any of the lawsuits. If any of the lawsuits were to be determined adversely to us or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum
of money were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

We may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts.

Instead of purchasing hotel properties directly, we may invest as a co-venturer.
Joint venturers often share control over the operation of the joint venture assets. For example, we entered into a joint venture with Marriott International that owns two limited partnerships holding, in the aggregate, 120 Courtyard by Marriott
hotels. Subsidiaries of Marriott International manage these Courtyard by Marriott hotels and other subsidiaries of Marriott International serve as ground lessors and mezzanine lender to the partnerships. Actions by a co-venturer could subject the
assets to additional risk, including:

·

our co-venturer in an investment might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our, or the joint venture’s, interests or goals;

·

our co-venturer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives; or

·

our co-venturer could go bankrupt, leaving us liable for its share of joint venture liabilities.

Although we generally will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture to permit our objectives to be achieved,
we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners. Also, our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent.

Environmental problems are possible and can be
costly.

We believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws. Unidentified environmental liabilities could arise, however, and could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and performance. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic
substances or petroleum product releases at the property. The owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by the parties in connection with the
contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the
contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental
contamination emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that
they notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may
impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.

Compliance with other government regulations can be
costly.

Our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, building codes and regulations pertaining to fire safety. Compliance with those laws and
regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. These regulations may be changed from time to time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. Any increased costs could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Future terrorist attacks or changes in terror alert levels could adversely affect us.

Previous terrorist attacks in the United States have adversely affected the travel and hospitality
industries, including the full-service


portion of the hotel industry. The impact which terrorist attacks in the United States or elsewhere could have on our business in particular and the U.S.
economy, the global economy and global financial markets in general is indeterminable. It is possible that such attacks or the threat of such attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to finance our business, our
ability to insure our properties and on our results of operations and financial condition as a whole.

Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.

We carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability,
property, business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties. These policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar type properties. Generally, our
“all-risk” property policies provide that coverage is available on a per occurrence basis and that, for each occurrence, there is an overall limit as well as various sub-limits on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive. Sub-limits
exist for certain types of claims such as service interruption, abatement, earthquakes, expediting costs or landscaping replacement, and the dollar amounts of these sub-limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage
limit. Our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub-limits contained in
our policies have been exceeded and, in the case of our hotels where the manager provides this coverage, any such claims will also be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the managers’ program for the same purpose. That
means that, if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels, or, in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the management company, affects hotels owned by others, the claims from each affected hotel will be added
together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached and each affected hotel will only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy. We
may incur losses in excess of insured limits and, as a result, we may be even less likely to receive sufficient coverage for risks that affect multiple properties such as earthquakes or certain types of terrorism.

In addition, there are other risks such as war, certain forms of terrorism
such as nuclear, biological or chemical terrorism and some environmental hazards that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or may be too expensive to justify insuring against. If
any such risk were to materialize and materially adversely affect one or more of our properties, we would likely not be able to recover our losses.

We may also encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our
policy. Should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier, we could lose all, or a portion of, the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the
anticipated future revenue from the hotel. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property.

We may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance for losses caused by some types of terrorist
acts, and federal terrorism legislation does not ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future.

As a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks, most insurers ceased to offer terrorism coverage in conjunction with “all-risk” property policies (described below), and the main source of property terrorism coverage became separate “standalone” terrorism insurance
policies offering limited coverage amounts with high premium levels. We have procured such standalone terrorism coverage, which is subject to annual aggregate limits which fall below the full replacement cost of certain high value properties, and
with more limited coverage than the all-risk program shared among various hotels.

On November 26, 2002, the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) required all-risk and liability insurers who had excluded or limited terrorism coverage to remove the exclusion in exchange for requiring
insureds to pay an additional premium for the coverage within a specified time period. Because our liability policies generally offered terrorism coverage, TRIA mainly impacts our all-risk insurance.


We, through Marriott International and our broker for certain of our non-Marriott International
properties, purchased the additional TRIA terrorism coverage. The original standalone policies were allowed to expire. This terrorism coverage, compared to standalone coverage, offers the higher limits and more comprehensive coverage associated with
our all-risk programs. However, as noted above, the all-risk program also has limitations such as per occurrence limits and sublimits which might have to be shared proportionally across participating hotels under certain loss scenarios. All-risk
insurers also only have to provide TRIA-related coverage for “certified” acts of terrorism—namely those which are committed on behalf of non-United States persons or interests. Further, we do not have full replacement coverage at all
of our properties for acts of terrorism committed on behalf of United States persons or interests, as our coverage for such incidents is limited to that provided by a new standalone program, or an endorsement to the policy covering our non-Marriott
properties, and their aggregate limits. In addition, property damage related to war and to nuclear incidents is excluded under our standalone terrorism policy. The all-risk policy also excludes coverage for chemical and biological incidents, and it
is unclear whether these incidents would be covered under our other standalone policy. While TRIA will reimburse insurers for losses resulting from nuclear, biological and chemical perils, TRIA does not require insurers to offer coverage for these
perils and, to date, insurers are not willing to provide this coverage, even with government reinsurance. In addition, TRIA terminates on December 31, 2005, and there is no guarantee that the terrorism coverage that it mandates will be readily
available or affordable thereafter. As a result of the above, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the extent and adequacy of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of future terrorist attacks
that impact our properties.

Risks of Ownership of our Common Stock

There are limitations on the acquisition of our common
stock and changes in control.

Our charter and bylaws, the partnership agreement of the operating partnership, our stockholder rights plan and the Maryland General Corporation Law contain a number of provisions, the
exercise of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of us that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in their best interests, including the following:

·

Ownership limit.

The 9.8% ownership limit described under “Risk Factors—Risks of Ownership of our Common Stock—There are possible
adverse consequences of limits on ownership of our common stock” may have the effect of precluding a change in control of us by a third party without the consent of our Board of Directors, even if the change in control would be in the interest
of our stockholders, and even if the change in control would not reasonably jeopardize our real estate investment trust, or “REIT,” status.

·

Staggered board.

Our charter provides that our number of directors may be increased or decreased according to our bylaws, provided that the total
number of directors is not less than three nor more than 13. Pursuant to our bylaws, the number of directors will be fixed by our Board of Directors within the limits in our charter. Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors.
Directors for each class are chosen for a three-year term when the term of the current class expires. The staggered terms for directors may affect stockholders’ ability to effect a change in control of us, even if a change in control would be
in the interest of our stockholders. Currently, there are seven directors.

·

Removal of board of directors.

Our charter provides that, except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of
capital stock other than our common stock, directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast for the election of directors. Vacancies on the
Board of Directors may be filled by the concurring vote of a majority of the remaining directors and, in the case of a vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders, by at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast
in the election of directors.

·

Preferred shares; classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval.

Our charter
provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that we have authority to issue is 800,000,000, initially consisting of 750,000,000 shares of common stock


and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 14,173,182 shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2003. Our Board of
Directors has the authority, without a vote of stockholders, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock, including common stock into preferred stock or vice versa, and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred or other
class or series of shares to be issued. The issuance of preferred shares or other shares having special preferences or rights could delay, defer or prevent a change in control even if a change in control would be in the interests of our
stockholders. Because our Board of Directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of additional classes or series of shares without a stockholder vote, our Board of Directors may give the holders of any class or series preferences,
powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of our common stock.

·

Consent rights of the limited partners.

Under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we generally will be able to merge or consolidate
with another entity with the consent of partners holding limited percentage interests that are more than 50% of the aggregate percentage interests of the outstanding limited partnership interests entitled to vote on the merger or consolidation,
including any limited partnership interests held by us, as long as the holders of limited partnership interests either receive or have the right to receive the same consideration as our stockholders. We, as holder of a majority of the limited
partnership interests, would be able to control the vote. Under our charter, holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding shares of common stock generally must approve the merger or consolidation.

·

Maryland business combination law.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, specified “business combinations,” including specified
issuances of equity securities, between a Maryland corporation and any person who owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation’s then outstanding shares, or an “interested stockholder,” or an affiliate of the interested
stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Thereafter, any of these specified business combinations must be approved by 80% of the votes entitled to be
cast by the holders of outstanding voting shares and by two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of voting shares other than voting shares held by an interested stockholder unless, among other conditions, the corporation’s
common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined in the Maryland General Corporation Law, for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder. We are subject to the
Maryland business combination statute.

·

Maryland control share acquisition law.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, “control shares” acquired in a “control share
acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquiror, by officers or by directors who are employees of the corporation.
“Control shares” are voting shares which, if aggregated with all other voting shares previously acquired by the acquiror or over which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a
revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power: (1) one-tenth or more but less than one-third, (2) one-third or more but less than a majority or (3) a
majority or more of the voting power. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of
control shares, subject to specified exceptions. We are subject to these control share provisions of Maryland law.

·

Merger, consolidation, share exchange and transfer of our assets.

Pursuant to our charter, subject to the terms of any outstanding
class or series of capital stock, we can merge with or into another entity, consolidate with one or more other entities, participate in a share exchange or transfer our assets within the meaning of the Maryland General Corporation Law if approved
(1) by our Board of Directors in the manner provided in the Maryland General Corporation Law and (2) by our stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, except that any merger of us with or into a trust
organized for the purpose of changing our form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires


only the approval of our stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law,
specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange is only required to be approved by a Maryland corporation by its Board of Directors if the corporation is the successor. Our voluntary dissolution also would
require approval of stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.

Amendments to our charter and bylaws.

Our charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transferability of our common stock, the classified
Board of Directors, fixing the size of our Board of Directors within the range set forth in our charter, removal of directors and the filling of vacancies, all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors and
approved by our stockholders holding two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Amendments of this provision of our charter also would require action of our Board of Directors and approval by stockholders holding two-thirds of all
the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. As permitted under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our bylaws provide that directors have the exclusive right to amend our bylaws.

·

Stockholder rights plan.

We adopted a stockholder rights plan which provides, among other things, that when specified events occur, our stockholders
will be entitled to purchase from us a newly created class or series of junior preferred shares, subject to our ownership limit described below. The preferred share purchase rights are triggered by the earlier to occur of (1) ten days after the date
of a public announcement that a person or group acting in concert has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock or (2) ten business days after the commencement of or
announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in the acquiring person becoming the beneficial owner of 20% or more of our outstanding common stock. The exercise of the preferred share
purchase rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.

There are possible adverse consequences of limits on ownership of our common stock.

To maintain our qualification as a
REIT for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include some entities. In
addition, a person who owns, directly or by attribution, 10% or more of an interest in a tenant of ours, or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner, cannot own, directly or by attribution, 10% or more of our shares without jeopardizing
our qualification as a REIT. Primarily to facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the ownership limit under our charter prohibits ownership, directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code, by any person or persons acting as a group, of more than 9.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, subject to an exception for shares of our common stock held prior to our conversion into a REIT (referred
to as the “REIT conversion”) so long as the holder would not own more than 9.9% in value of our outstanding shares after the REIT conversion, and prohibits ownership, directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code, by any person, or persons acting as a group, of more than 9.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our preferred shares. Together, these limitations are referred to as the “ownership limit.”

Our Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion,
may waive or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons who would not be treated as “individuals” for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code if the Board of Directors is satisfied, based upon information required to be
provided by the party seeking the waiver and, if it determines necessary or advisable, upon an opinion of counsel satisfactory to our Board of Directors, that ownership in excess of this limit will not cause a person who is an individual to be
treated as owning shares in excess of the ownership limit, applying the applicable constructive ownership rules, and will not otherwise jeopardize our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes (for example, by causing any of our tenants to be
considered a “related party tenant” for purposes of the REIT qualification rules). Common stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a


designated charitable beneficiary, and the person who acquired the common stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions
thereon, to vote those shares of common stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the common stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the common stock or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares of our
common stock to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances, and, in any event, would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of our common stock in excess of
the ownership limit. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect the stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price
for our common stock in connection with such transaction.

Shares of our common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the price for shares of our common stock.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that sales
could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. In addition, holders of units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership (referred to as “OP Units”), whose OP Units are redeemed by the
operating partnership in exchange for common stock, will be able to sell those shares freely, unless the person is our affiliate and resale of the affiliate’s shares is not covered by an effective registration statement. As of December 31,
2003, there are approximately 23.5 million OP Units outstanding, all of which are currently redeemable. Further, a substantial number of shares of our common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our
employee benefit plans, including shares of our common stock reserved for options, and these shares of common stock would be available for sale in the public markets from time to time pursuant to exemptions from registration or upon registration.
Moreover, additional shares of our common stock issued by us would be available in the future for sale in the public markets. We can make no prediction about the effect that future sales of our common stock would have on the market price of our
common stock.

Our earnings and cash distributions will
affect the market price of shares of our common stock.

We believe that the market value of a REIT’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the REIT’s growth potential and its
current and potential future cash distributions, whether from operations, sales, acquisitions, development or refinancings, and is secondarily based upon the value of the underlying assets. For that reason, shares of our common stock may trade at
prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders, these
retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Our failure to meet the market’s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely
adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Market interest rates may affect the price of shares of our common stock.

We believe that one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a REIT is the
distribution rate on the shares, considered as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of REIT shares may expect a higher distribution rate. Thus, higher
market interest rates could cause the market price of our shares to go down.

Federal Income Tax Risks

Recent changes in
taxable of corporate dividends may adversely affect the value of our stock.

While corporate dividends have traditionally been taxed at ordinary income rates, dividends received by individuals through December 31, 2008 from
regular C corporations generally will be taxed at the maximum capital gains tax rate of 15% as opposed to the maximum ordinary income tax rate of 35%. REIT dividends are not eligible for the lower capital gains rates, except in certain circumstances
where the dividends are attributable to income that has been subject to corporate-level tax. While the earnings of a REIT that are distributed to its stockholders generally will be subject to less federal income taxation than earnings of a non-REIT
C corporation that are distributed to its stockholders net of corporate-level income tax, this difference in the taxation of dividends could cause individual investors to view the stock of regular C corporations as more attractive relative to the
stock of REITs. Individual investors could hold this view because the dividends from regular C corporations will


generally be taxed at a lower rate while dividends from REITs will generally be taxed at the same rate as the individual’s other ordinary income. We
cannot predict what effect, if any, this difference in the taxation of dividends may have on the value of the stock of REITs, either in terms of price or relative to other potential investments.

To qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our
taxable income, irrespective of our available cash or outstanding obligations.

To continue to qualify as a REIT, we currently are required to distribute to our stockholders with respect to each year at least 90% of our
taxable income, excluding net capital gain. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions made by us with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary
income and 95% of our capital gain net income for that year and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods less excess distributions from prior years. We intend to make distributions, subject to the availability of cash and in compliance
with any debt covenants, to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from the operating partnership. However, there are differences in
timing between our recognition of taxable income and our receipt of cash available for distribution due to, among other things, the seasonality of the lodging industry and the fact that some taxable income will be “phantom” income, which
is taxable income that is not matched by cash flow to us. Due to some transactions entered into in years prior to the REIT conversion, we could recognize substantial amounts of “phantom” income. It is possible that these timing differences
could require us to borrow funds or to issue additional equity to enable us to meet the distribution requirement and, therefore, to maintain our REIT status, and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax. In addition, because the REIT distribution
requirements prevent us from retaining earnings, we will generally be required to refinance debt that matures with additional debt or equity. We cannot assure you that any of the sources of funds, if available at all, would be sufficient to meet our
distribution and tax obligations.

Adverse tax consequences
would apply if we failed to qualify as a REIT.

We believe that we have been organized and have operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with our taxable year
beginning January 1, 1999, and we currently intend to continue to operate as a REIT during future years. No assurance can be provided, however, that we qualify as a REIT or that new legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations
or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of our REIT qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to take a deduction
for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income, and we will be subject to Federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. In addition, unless
entitled to statutory relief, we would not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification is lost. Any determination that we do not qualify as a REIT would have a materially adverse effect on our
results of operations and could reduce the value of our common stock materially. The additional tax liability to us for the year or years in which we did not qualify would reduce our net earnings available for investment, debt service or
distribution to our stockholders. Furthermore, we would no longer be required to make any distributions to stockholders as a condition to REIT qualification and all of our distributions to stockholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends
to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, or “E&P.” This means that stockholders taxed as individuals currently would be taxes on those dividends at capital gains rates and corporate stockholders generally
would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject in each case, to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. Our failure to qualify as a REIT also would cause an event of default under our
credit facility that could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due under the credit facility, which, in turn, would constitute an event of default under our outstanding debt securities.

We will be disqualified as a REIT at least for taxable year 1999 if we
failed to distribute all of our E&P attributable to our non-REIT taxable years.

In order to qualify as a REIT, we cannot have at the end of any taxable year any undistributed E&P that is attributable to one of our
non-REIT taxable years. A REIT has until the close of its first taxable year as a REIT in which it has non-REIT E&P to distribute its accumulated


E&P. We were required to have distributed this E&P prior to the end of 1999, the first taxable year for which our REIT election was effective. If we
failed to do this, we will be disqualified as a REIT at least for taxable year 1999. We believe that distributions of non-REIT E&P that we made were sufficient to distribute all of the non-REIT E&P as of December 31, 1999, but we cannot
provide assurance that we met this requirement.

If our
leases are not respected as true leases for Federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.

To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income tests, under which specified percentages of our gross
income must be passive income, like rent. For the rent paid pursuant to the leases, which constitutes substantially all of our gross income, to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for Federal
income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement. In addition, the lessees must not be regarded as related party tenants, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that the
leases will be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will agree with this view. We also believe that Crestline, the lessee of substantially all of our full service hotels prior to
January 1, 2001, was not a related party tenant and, as a result of changes in the tax laws effective January 1, 2001, HMT Lessee, LLC, or HMT Lessee, will not be treated as a related party tenant so long as it qualifies as a taxable REIT
subsidiary. If the leases were not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes or if the lessees were regarded as related party tenants, we would not be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs and we
would lose our REIT status. See “Risk Factors—Federal Income Tax Risks—Adverse tax consequences would apply if we failed to qualify as a REIT” above.

If HMT Lessee LLC fails to qualify as a taxable REIT subsidiary, we would fail to qualify as a
REIT.

For our taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, as a result of REIT tax law changes under the specific provisions of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, which we refer to as
the “REIT Modernization Act,” we are permitted to lease our hotels to a subsidiary of the operating partnership that is taxable as a corporation and that elects to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Accordingly, HMT Lessee has
directly or indirectly acquired all of the full-service hotel leasehold interests from third parties. So long as HMT Lessee and other affiliated lessees qualify as taxable REIT subsidiaries of ours, they will not be treated as “related party
tenants.” We believe that HMT Lessee qualifies to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS will not challenge its status as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income
tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in disqualifying HMT Lessee from treatment as a taxable REIT subsidiary, we would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to REITs and substantially all of
our income would fail to qualify for the gross income tests and, accordingly, we would cease to qualify as a REIT. See “Risk Factors—Federal Income Tax Risks—Adverse tax consequences would apply if we failed to qualify as a REIT”
above.

Despite our REIT status, we remain subject to
various taxes, including substantial deferred and contingent tax liabilities.

Notwithstanding our status as a REIT, we are subject, through our ownership interest in the operating partnership, to certain Federal, state,
local and foreign taxes on our income and property. In addition, we will be required to pay Federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate upon our share of any “built-in gain” recognized as a result of any sale before January 1,
2009, by the operating partnership of assets, including the hotels, in which interests were acquired by the operating partnership from our predecessor and its subsidiaries as part of the REIT conversion. Built-in gain is the amount by which an
asset’s fair market value exceeded our adjusted basis in the asset on January 1, 1999, the first day of our first taxable year as a REIT. The total amount of gain on which we would be subject to corporate income tax if the assets that we held
at the time of the REIT conversion were sold in a taxable transaction prior to January 1, 2009 would be material to us. In addition, at the time of the REIT conversion, we expected that we or Rockledge Hotel Properties, Inc. or Fernwood Hotel
Assets, Inc., or Rockledge and Fernwood, respectively (each of which is a taxable corporation in which the operating partnership owned a 95% nonvoting interest and, as of April, 2001, acquired 100% of the voting interests and each of which, elected
to be a taxable REIT subsidiary effective January 1, 2001), likely would recognize substantial built-in gain and deferred tax liabilities in the next ten years without any


corresponding receipt of cash by us or the operating partnership. We may have to pay certain state income taxes because not all states treat REITs the same
as they are treated for federal income tax purposes. We may also have to pay certain foreign taxes to the extent we own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions. The operating partnership is obligated under its partnership agreement to
pay all such taxes (and any related interest and penalties) incurred by us, as well as any liabilities that the IRS or the tax authorities successfully may assert against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time we qualified
as a REIT. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries, including Rockledge, Fernwood and HMT Lessee, are taxable as corporations and will pay federal, state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable corporate rates, and foreign taxes to the
extent they own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions.

If the IRS were to challenge successfully the operating partnership’s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.

We
believe that the operating partnership qualifies to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, it is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is required to pay
tax on its allocable share of the operating partnership’s income. No assurance can be provided, however, that the IRS will not challenge its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a
challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for tax purposes, we would fail to meet the income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, cease to qualify as a REIT. If
the operating partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or we fail to qualify as a REIT, either failure would cause an event of default under our credit facility that, in turn, could constitute an event of default
under our outstanding debt securities. Also, the failure of the operating partnership to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash
available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including us. Finally, the classification of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause us to recognize gain at least equal to our “negative capital account,” if
any.

As a REIT, we are subject to limitations on our
ownership of debt and equity securities.

Subject to the exceptions discussed in this paragraph, a REIT is prohibited from owning securities in any one issuer to the extent that the value of those securities exceeds 5% of
the value of the REIT’s total assets or the securities owned by the REIT represent more than 10% of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities or more than 10% of the value of the issuer’s outstanding securities. A REIT is permitted
to own securities of a subsidiary in an amount that exceeds the 5% value test and the 10% vote or value test if the subsidiary elects to be a “taxable REIT subsidiary,” which is taxable as a corporation. However, a REIT may not own
securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 20% of the value of the REIT’s total assets.

Our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to special rules that may result in increased taxes.

Several Internal Revenue Code
provisions ensure that a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation. For example, a taxable REIT subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated REIT. In addition, the
REIT has to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that it receives if the economic arrangements between the REIT and the taxable REIT subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties.

We may be required to pay a penalty tax upon the sale of a
hotel.

The Federal income tax provisions applicable to REITs provide that any gain realized by a REIT on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course
of business is treated as income from a “prohibited transaction” that is subject to a 100% penalty tax. Under existing law, whether property, including hotels, is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course
of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular transaction. The operating partnership intends that it and its subsidiaries will hold the hotels for investment with a view to
long-term appreciation, to engage in the business of acquiring and owning hotels and to make occasional sales of hotels as are consistent with the operating partnership’s investment objectives. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS might
not contend that one or more of these sales is subject to the 100% penalty tax.

Supplemental schedule of noncash investing and financing activities:

During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we issued 56.6 million, 2.3 million and 42.6 million shares of common stock, respectively. Of the shares issued, approximately
4.2 million, 1.8 million and 42.1 million shares of common stock, respectively, were issued for 2003, 2002 and 2001 upon the conversion of operating partnership units, or OP Units, of Host Marriott, L.P. held by minority partners valued at $41
million, $21 million and $547 million, respectively.

Of the
2.3 million shares of common stock issued during 2002, 1.1 million shares were issued to acquire additional interests in the partnership owning the San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina. This transaction resulted in an increase of $10.5 million to
property and equipment and equity to reflect the fair value of the interests acquired. During April 2002, in a separate transaction, our ownership percentage in the San Diego partnership increased to 90% when the minority partners in the San Diego
partnership exchanged their interests for approximately 6.9 million OP Units. The transaction resulted in an increase of $56.1 million in property and equipment and a corresponding increase in minority interest liability to reflect the fair value of
the interests acquired.

During January 2002, we transferred
the St. Louis Marriott Pavilion to the mortgage lender. We recorded the difference between the debt extinguished, the deferred incentive management fees forgiven and the fair value of the assets surrendered of $22 million, net of tax expense of $9
million, as discontinued operations.

On June 14, 2002, we
acquired the Boston Marriott Copley Place in Boston, Massachusetts for a purchase price of $214 million, including the assumption of $97 million in mortgage debt.

During June 2003, we acquired the remaining general partner interest and the preferred equity interest held by outside
partners in the JW Marriott in Washington, D.C. for approximately $3 million. We also became the sole limited partner after the partnership foreclosed on a note receivable from the other limited partner. As a result, we began consolidating the
partnership and recorded $95 million of mortgage debt secured by the hotel and property and equipment of $131 million.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Host Marriott Corporation, a Maryland corporation, operating through an umbrella partnership structure, is primarily the owner of hotel properties. We
operate as a self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, with our operations conducted solely through an operating partnership, Host Marriott, L.P., or Host LP, or the operating partnership, and its subsidiaries. We are
the sole general partner of Host LP and as of December 31, 2003, own approximately 93% of the partnership interests, which are referred to as OP Units.

As of December 31, 2003, we owned, or had controlling interests in, 117 upper-upscale and luxury, full-service hotel lodging properties generally located
throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico operated primarily under the Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, Hyatt and Hilton brand names. Of these properties, 93 are managed or franchised by Marriott International, Inc. and its subsidiaries
or Marriott International.

Basis of Presentation and
Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates. We consolidate entities (in the absence of other factors determining control) when we own over 50% of the voting shares of another company or,
in the case of partnership investments, when we own a majority of the general partnership interest. The control factors we consider include the ability of minority shareholders or other partners to participate in or block management decisions.
Additionally, if we determine that we are an owner in a variable interest entity within the meaning of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, revision to Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and
that our variable interest will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns if they occur, or both, then we will consolidate the entity. All material
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated, including the dividends and related transactions for our Class D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock held by one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Accounting for the Impact of the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Acts

On December 3, 2003, we settled all outstanding issues related to the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 with our insurer, Marriott International, Inc. and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for the New York Marriott World Trade Center and Financial Center hotels and received net proceeds of
approximately $372 million, of which $65 million was used to repay the outstanding mortgage on the World Trade Center hotel. Prior to reaching this settlement, we were obligated under our ground lease to rebuild the hotel on the site and as such
recorded insurance proceeds in continuing operations. We recorded business interruption proceeds, net of expenses, of $14 million and $11 million for the World Trade Center hotel in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and a gain on the settlement of
approximately $212 million in 2003. We now consider the World Trade Center hotel to be abandoned and the gain on disposition and related business interruption income, net of expenses, for that hotel has been reclassified to discontinued operations
for all periods presented in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (SFAS 144) “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” As part of the settlement, we received a right of first offer
through 2023 with respect to hotel development on the World Trade Center site.


HOST MARRIOTT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The New York Financial Center hotel was also damaged in the attacks and, as a result, we recorded
business interruption proceeds, net of expenses, of approximately $3 million and $6 million in room revenues in the consolidated statement of operations in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share

Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders as adjusted for potentially dilutive securities, by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus other potentially dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans, those preferred OP Units held by minority partners, other minority
interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interests to common OP Units and the Convertible Preferred Securities. No effect is shown for any securities that are anti-dilutive.

Property and
Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost. For
newly developed properties, cost includes interest, ground rent and real estate taxes incurred during development and construction. Replacements and improvements and capital leases are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 40 years for buildings and three to ten years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets.

Gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of sale or deferred to the extent required by GAAP. Deferred gains are recognized as income in subsequent periods as conditions requiring deferral are satisfied or expire without
further cost to us.

We assess impairment of our real estate
properties based on whether it is probable that estimated undiscounted future cash flows from each individual property are less than its net book value. If a property is impaired, a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and net
book value of the hotel.


HOST MARRIOTT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We will classify a hotel as held for sale in the period in which we have made the decision to dispose
of the hotel, a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be
completed in a timely manner. If this criteria is met, we will record an impairment loss if the fair value less costs to sell is lower than the carrying amount of the hotel and will cease incurring depreciation. We will classify the loss, together
with the related operating results, as discontinued operations on our statement of operations and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash includes reserves for debt service, real estate taxes,
insurance, furniture and fixtures, as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits due to mortgage debt agreement restrictions and provisions.

Minority Interest

The percentage of the operating partnership owned by third parties, which was 7% as of December 31, 2003 and 10% as of December 31, 2002, is presented as
interest of minority partners of Host LP in the consolidated balance sheets and was $130 million and $131 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Third party partnership interests in consolidated investments of the operating
partnership that have finite lives are included in interest of minority partners of other consolidated partnerships in the consolidated balance sheets and totaled $86 million and $89 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Third party
partnership interests in consolidated investments that have infinite lives are also included in interest of minority partners of other consolidated partnerships in the consolidated balance sheets and totaled $3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes.” These deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted.

We have elected to be treated as a REIT under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and, as such, are not subject to federal income tax, provided we
distribute all of our taxable income annually to our shareholders and comply with certain other requirements. In addition to paying federal and state taxes on any retained income, we are subject to taxes on “built-in-gains” on sales of
certain assets. Additionally, our consolidated taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to Federal, state and foreign income tax. The consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes, primarily, the tax provision related to the operations of the
taxable REIT subsidiaries, Federal and state taxes on undistributed taxable income, and foreign taxes at the operating partnership, as well as each of their respective subsidiaries.

Deferred Charges

Financing costs related to long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the debt.

Foreign Currency Translation

As of December 31, 2003, our foreign operations consist of four properties
located in Canada and two properties located in Mexico, one of which was sold in January 2004. The operations of these properties are maintained in the local currency and then translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for the
period. The assets and liabilities of the properties are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The components of total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the
balance sheet are as follows (in millions):

Derivative
Instruments

We have interest rate swaps and interest rate
caps which are considered derivative instruments. If the requirements for hedge accounting are met, amounts paid or received under these agreements are recognized over the life of the agreements as adjustments to interest expense, and the fair value
of the derivatives is recorded on the accompanying balance sheet, with offsetting adjustments or charges recorded to the underlying debt. Otherwise the instruments are marked to market, and the gains and losses from the changes in the market value
of the contracts are recorded in other income or expense. Upon early termination of an interest rate swap or cap, gains or losses are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense of the related debt over the remaining period covered by
the terminated swap or cap.

We are also subject to exposure
from fluctuations in foreign currencies relating to our properties located in Canada and two properties in Mexico, one of which was sold in January 2004. We have purchased currency forward contracts related to the Canadian properties, which are
considered derivative instruments. Gains and losses on contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with offsetting changes recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income. At December
31, 2003, these contracts do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting and are marked to market and included in other income each period. See Note 4 for further discussion of these contracts.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalents with various high credit-quality financial institutions. We perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these
financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one institution.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

At December 31, 2003, we maintained two stock-based employee compensation
plans, which are described more fully in Note 9. Prior to 2002, we accounted for those plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations.
No stock-based employee compensation cost relating to the employee stock option plan is reflected in 2001 net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date
of grant. In addition, no stock-based employee compensation cost relating to the employee stock purchase plan is reflected in 2001 net income as the plan was considered non-compensatory under APB 25. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” or SFAS 123, prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2002. Awards under our employee stock option plan
generally vest over four years. Therefore, the cost related to stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for 2003 and 2002 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been
applied to these awards since the original effective date of SFAS 123. The adoption of SFAS 123 did not change the calculation of stock-based employee compensation costs for shares granted under our deferred stock and restricted stock plans. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all of our outstanding and unvested awards in each period.

Application of New
Accounting Standards

The FASB recently issued SFAS No.
150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,” or SFAS 150. This statement requires issuers to classify as liabilities (or assets in some circumstances) three classes of
freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer. Previously, many such instruments had been classified as equity. A freestanding financial instrument is an instrument that is entered into separately and apart from any of
the entity’s other financial instruments or equity transactions, or that is entered into in conjunction with some other transaction and is legally detachable and separately exercisable, such as certain put and call options. These provisions are
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. On October 8, 2003, the FASB issued guidance with respect to SFAS
150 that issuers whose financial statements include consolidated ventures with finite lives should reflect any minority interests in such consolidated ventures on the issuer’s financial statements as a liability on the issuer’s financial
statements presented at its fair value as of the applicable balance sheet date. Under SFAS 150, any fluctuation in the fair value of the minority interest from period to period would be recorded on the issuers financial statements as interest
expense for the change in the fair value of the liability.


HOST MARRIOTT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

As a result of applying SFAS 150 in accordance with this guidance from the FASB, in our third quarter 2003 Form 10-Q, we recorded a loss from a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle of $24 million. Additionally, we included in our liabilities as of September 12, 2003, minority interests with a fair value of $112 million.

On November 7, 2003, the FASB issued a FASB Staff Position (FSP) 150-3 indefinitely deferring the application of a portion
of SFAS 150 with respect to minority interests in consolidated ventures entered into prior to November 5, 2003, effectively reversing its guidance of October 8, 2003. In accordance with the FSP 150-3, we recorded a gain from a cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, reversing the impact of our adoption of SFAS 150 with respect to consolidated ventures with finite lives. While there is no financial statement impact, FSP 150-3 does
require disclosure of the fair value of the minority interests. See Note 18 for further details.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN No. 46 “

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”

(“FIN 46R”). Under
this guidance, our limited purpose trust subsidiary that was formed to issue trust-preferred securities (the “Convertible Preferred Securities Trust”) is considered to be a special purpose entity because its activities are so restricted
that Host Marriott, the sole equity holder, lacks the ability to make decisions about the Convertible Preferred Securities Trust’s activities through voting or similar rights. The transition guidance set forth in FIN 46R allows us to apply the
provisions of either FIN 46 or FIN 46R to special purpose entities in which we have a variable interest at December 31, 2003. We account for our Convertible Preferred Securities Trust on a consolidated basis as of December 31, 2003 since we are the
primary beneficiary under FIN 46 based on our fixed price call option and the holders of the Convertible Preferred Securities are widely dispersed and unrelated.

We are required to apply the provisions of FIN 46R to the Convertible Preferred Securities Trust in our first quarter of
2004. Under FIN 46R we will not be the primary beneficiary and, accordingly, we are required to deconsolidate in the accounts of the Convertible Preferred Securities Trust. This will result in our recognizing the $492 million in debentures issued by
Convertible Preferred Securities Trust as debt, eliminating the $475 million of Convertible Preferred Securities currently classified in the mezzanine section of our balance sheet and recognizing, as an equity investment, the $17 million invested in
the Convertible Preferred Securities Trust. Additionally, we would classify the related dividend payments as interest expense.

Interest cost capitalized in connection with our development and construction activities totaled $2

On
December 31, 2003, we classified five of our hotels as held for sale and recorded an impairment loss of $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Three of these hotels were sold in January 2004. During 2001, we recorded impairment charges of $13
million related to three properties to reduce their carrying value to estimated fair value. One of the hotels was sold in December 2001 and the other two were sold in 2003. See Note 11.

Investments in Affiliates

We own investments in voting interest entities which we do not consolidate and, accordingly, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The
debt of these affiliates is non-recourse to, and not guaranteed by, us. Investments in affiliates consists of the following:

CBM Joint Venture LLC
is a joint venture that was formed by Rockledge Hotel Properties, Inc. (“Rockledge”) and Marriott International, that collectively owns, through two limited partnerships, 120 limited service hotels. The joint venture has approximately $901
million of debt, which is comprised of first mortgage loans secured by the properties owned by each of the two partnerships, senior notes secured by the ownership interest in one partnership and mezzanine debt. The mezzanine debt is an obligation of
a subsidiary of the joint venture and the lender is an affiliate of Marriott International. None of the debt is recourse to or guaranteed by us or any of our subsidiaries. Each of the joint venture’s 120 hotels is operated by Marriott
International pursuant to long-term management agreements. Rockledge, currently a consolidated, wholly owned subsidiary of ours, owns a 50% non-controlling interest in the joint venture and records the investment using the equity method. We did not
receive any distributions from this investment during 2003 or 2002.

We have a 49% limited partner interest in Tiburon Golf Ventures, L.P., which owns the golf club surrounding The Ritz-Carlton, Naples Golf Resort. Cash distributions from this investment were approximately $1 million in both 2003 and 2002.

During June 2003, we acquired the remaining general partner interest and preferred equity interest
held by outside partners in the JWDC Limited Partnership, which owns the JW Marriott Hotel, a 772-room hotel in Washington, D.C. for approximately $3 million. We also became the sole limited partner after the partnership foreclosed on a note
receivable from the other limited partner. As a result, effective June 20, 2003, we consolidated the partnership, and recorded property and equipment of $131 million and $95 million in mortgage debt.

We own minority interests in four partnerships that directly or indirectly
own four hotels. The total carrying value of these partnerships is less than $500,000, and we do not have any guarantees or commitments in relation to these partnerships and all of the debt is non-recourse to us.

Debt

Debt consists of the following:

Senior Notes

We have various series of senior notes outstanding, all
of which, except for the Series J senior notes, have been issued under the same indenture. The indenture contains certain financial covenants that, in the event of a default, would prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness. These covenants
include a consolidated coverage ratio of EBITDA-to-interest expense of 2.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2003, we are not in compliance with the ratio which limits our ability to incur additional debt and make dividend payments except to the extent
required to maintain our REIT status. The Series J indenture contains certain provisions that allow for additional flexibility to incur debt, utilize asset sale proceeds, make certain investments and pay dividends on our preferred stock. However,
these provisions will only go into effect once all pre-Series J senior notes are repaid or the pre-Series J indenture has been amended to allow for these same provisions.

The outstanding senior notes balance as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 of $3,180 million and $3,247 million, respectively,
include fair value adjustments for interest rate swap agreements of $36.8 million and $40.3 million, respectively, that are discussed in further detail below.

Issuances.

In October 2003, we issued $725 million of 7


/


% Series J senior notes due in 2013. The proceeds were used to redeem $429 million of our existing Series A senior notes and $282 million of our existing
Series C senior notes. In February 2004, the Series J senior notes were exchanged for $725 million of 7


/


%
Series K senior notes. The terms of the Series K senior notes are substantially identical to the terms of the Series J notes, except that the Series K senior notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and are, therefore, freely
transferable.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Repayments.

During 2003, we redeemed approximately $790 million of
senior notes, $711 million which were redeemed with the proceeds from the Series J senior notes. The terms of our senior notes require the payment of a call premium to holders in exchange for the right to retire this debt in advance of its maturity
date. We recorded a loss of approximately $30 million on the early extinguishment of debt, which includes the payment of the call premium and the acceleration of the related deferred financing fees. The loss is included in interest expense in the
accompanying statements of operations.

On September 16, 2002,
we redeemed the remaining $12.6 million of 9


/


% senior secured notes due in May 2005 at approximately 101% of
par. We recorded a minimal loss on the extinguishment related to the payment of a premium and acceleration of deferred financing fees. The loss is included in interest expense in the accompanying statement of operations.

Credit Facility

Effective June 6, 2002, we entered into a credit facility with an aggregate
revolving loan commitment of $400 million ($300 million of which was available initially, with the balance becoming available to the extent that our leverage ratio met a specified level). The credit facility has an initial three-year term with an
option to extend for an additional year if certain conditions are met. Interest on borrowings under the credit facility are calculated based on a spread over LIBOR ranging from 2.50% to 3.75%. The rate will vary based on our leverage ratio. We are
required to pay a quarterly commitment fee that will vary based on the amount of unused capacity under the credit facility. Currently, the commitment fee is .55% on an annual basis for available capacity and .2% on additional capacity. In May 2003,
we renegotiated the credit facility to provide more flexibility in meeting certain tests under the covenants. The new terms of the credit facility allow us to borrow $250 million. All other terms of the credit facility remained essentially the same.
As of December 31, 2003, we have not drawn on the credit facility.

In addition to the customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions, the credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain leverage ratios below specified levels as well as interest, fixed charges and unsecured
interest coverage ratios above specified levels. We are currently in compliance with these covenants.

Under the terms of the senior notes indenture and the credit facility, our ability to incur indebtedness is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction
of various conditions, including an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio (as defined in the senior notes indenture) of Host LP of at least 2.0 to 1.0. We have not met this interest coverage ratio since the third quarter of 2002. As a result, our
ability to incur indebtedness is generally limited to indebtedness specifically permitted under the credit facility and the senior notes indenture, such as borrowings under the credit facility and borrowings in connection with the refinancing of
existing debt. Our failure to meet the interest coverage ratio also restricts our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred equity, except to the extent necessary to maintain our status as a REIT and other distributions permitted under
the senior notes indenture.

Mortgage Debt

All of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except for
fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2003, we have 30 assets that are secured by mortgage debt. Eleven of these assets are secured by mortgage debt that contains restrictive covenants that
require the mortgage servicer or lender to retain and hold in escrow the cash flow after debt service when it declines below specified operating levels. The impact of these covenants is discussed below.

Eight of our hotel properties secure a $591 million mortgage loan that is the
sole asset of a trust that issued commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, which we refer to as the CMBS Loan. These hotels securing the CMBS Loan are the New York Marriott Marquis, the San Francisco Airport Hyatt Regency, the Cambridge Hyatt


HOST MARRIOTT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Regency, the Reston Hyatt Regency, the Boston Hyatt Regency, The Drake Hotel New York, the Westin Buckhead Atlanta, and the Swissôtel Chicago, which we
refer to as the CMBS Portfolio. The CMBS Loan contains a provision that requires the mortgage servicer to retain certain excess cash flow from the CMBS Portfolio after payment of debt service (approximately $64 million) if net cash flow after
payment of taxes, insurance, ground rent and reserves for furniture, fixtures and equipment for the trailing twelve months declines below $96 million. This provision was triggered beginning in the third quarter of 2002 and will remain in effect
until the CMBS Portfolio generates the necessary minimum cash flow for two consecutive quarters, at which point, the cash that has been escrowed will be returned to us. As of December 31, 2003, approximately $15 million of cash has been escrowed. We
do not expect cash flows from the CMBS Portfolio to be at the level required to trigger the release of the escrow until we have a significant improvement in operations. Additional amounts may also be escrowed, and these amounts may be significant.

On July 12, 2002, we modified the terms of the mortgage debt
secured by our four Canadian properties. Under the terms of this modification, we agreed to escrow the excess cash flow from these hotels on a retroactive basis effective December 29, 2001. In April 2003, approximately $7 million of the cash
escrowed in accordance with the loan was applied to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness and approximately $2 million was released to us. In July 2003, we entered into an agreement with the lenders to modify certain covenants so that we would
not be required to make additional prepayments at that time. The terms of the modification required us to provide $10 million of cash collateral and pay an additional 25 basis points of interest on the loan. On December 29, 2003, we made an
additional partial repayment of approximately $33 million. In conjunction with the prepayment, one of the hotels and the $10 million was released from the collateral. The remaining loan is still subject to the escrow provisions and additional
amounts will be required to be escrowed in 2004.

On September
9, 2003, we refinanced the $95 million mortgage debt secured by the JW Marriott in Washington, D.C. with an $88 million floating-rate mortgage loan with an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 210 basis points (3.3% at December 31, 2003). Although
the loan matures in 2005, we may extend the term of the loan for three one-year periods upon satisfaction of certain conditions (we must purchase an interest rate cap to obtain the first one-year extension and the two remaining extensions are
subject to certain debt service coverage levels). The loan may be prepaid beginning in May 2004, and no prepayment penalty will be assessed for any prepayments made after March 2005. We also purchased an interest rate cap at the inception of the
loan, as discussed below.

In January 2003, we prepaid $17
million of mortgage debt related to two of our Ritz-Carlton properties. We did not incur any prepayment penalties as a result of this debt extinguishment. The loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of deferred financing
fees, which was minimal, is included in interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations.

On June 14, 2002, in connection with our acquisition of the Boston Marriott Copley Place, we assumed $97 million of mortgage debt. The mortgage bears
interest at a fixed rate of 8.39% and is due on June 1, 2006. Also, in January of 2002, we transferred the St. Louis Marriott Pavilion hotel to the mortgage lender. In the first quarter of 2002, we recorded the difference between the debt
extinguished, the deferred incentive management fees forgiven and the fair value of the assets surrendered, net of tax, of $13 million as discontinued operations. See Note 11 for additional disclosure on the disposition.

Derivative Instruments

The mortgage loan on the Canadian properties is denominated in U.S. dollars
and the functional currency of the Canadian subsidiaries is the Canadian dollar. At the time of the origination of the loan, each of the


HOST MARRIOTT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

subsidiaries entered into 60 separate currency forward contracts to buy U.S. dollars at a fixed price. These forward contracts hedge the currency exposure of
converting Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars on a monthly basis to cover debt service payments, including the final balloon payment. These contracts had been designated as cash flow hedges of the debt service and balloon payment and were recorded at
fair value on the balance sheet with offsetting changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. During 2003, we prepaid approximately $40 million of the loan and terminated a foreign currency contract equal to the prepayment. As a
result, the forward currency contracts were deemed ineffective for accounting purposes, and we recorded a loss on the contracts of approximately $18 million, which is included in “Loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts” in the
accompanying statement of operations. We will record the increase or decrease in the fair value of the outstanding forward currency contracts in net income (loss) each period. The fair value of the contracts on December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $(12.3)
million and $3.8 million, respectively. We also purchased an interest rate cap for approximately $0.4 million which caps the floating interest rate at 10.75% based on a notional amount ($48.3 million). The cap is a derivative that is marked to
market and the gains and losses from changes in the market value of the cap are recorded in other income or expense in the current period. The fair value of the interest rate cap was $0.1 million at December 31, 2003.

On August 21, 2003, we entered into two four-year interest rate swap
agreements, which mature October 2007, effectively converting our Series G senior notes to floating rate debt. Under the swaps, we receive fixed-rate payments of 9.25% and we make floating-rate payments based on six-month LIBOR plus 590 basis points
(7.08% at December 31, 2003) on a $242 million notional amount, which is equal to the current amount of outstanding Series G senior notes. We have designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for both financial reporting and tax purposes
and the amounts paid or received under the swap agreements will be recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. Changes in the fair value of the swaps and our Series G senior notes are reflected in the balance
sheet as offsetting changes and have no income statement effect. The fair value of these interest rate swaps at December 31, 2003 was $2.3 million.

On December 20, 2001, we entered into a 5-year interest rate swap agreement, which was effective on January 15, 2002 and matures in January 2007,
effectively converting our Series I senior notes to floating rate debt. Under the swap, we receive fixed-rate payments of 9.5% and pay floating-rate payments based on one-month LIBOR plus 450 basis points (5.66% at December 31, 2003) on a $450
million notional amount, which is equal to the current amount of outstanding Series I senior notes. We have designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge for both financial reporting and tax purposes and the amounts paid or received under
the swap agreement will be recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense. Changes in the fair value of the swap and the Series I senior notes are reflected in the balance sheet as offsetting changes and have no
income statement effect. The fair value of this interest rate swap at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $34.5 million and $40.3 million, respectively.

In connection with the refinancing of the mortgage debt secured by the JW Marriott, Washington, D.C. in September 2003, we purchased an interest rate cap
with a notional amount of $88 million, which caps the floating interest rate at 8.1% for the first two years of the loan. The cap represents a derivative that is marked to market and the gains and losses from changes in the market value of the cap
are recorded in other income or expense in the current period. The fair value of the interest rate cap was $38,000 at December 31, 2003.

Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities of a Subsidiary Trust Whose Sole Assets are the Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due 2026

In December 1996, Host Marriott Financial Trust
(the “Issuer”), a wholly owned subsidiary trust, issued 11 million shares of 6


/


% convertible
quarterly income preferred securities (the “Convertible Preferred Securities”), with a liquidation preference of $50 per share (for a total liquidation amount of $550 million). The Convertible Preferred Securities represent an undivided
beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer. The payment of distributions out of moneys held by the Issuer and payments on liquidation of the Issuer or the redemption of the Convertible Preferred Securities are guaranteed by us to the extent the
Issuer has funds available therefor. This guarantee, when taken together with our obligations under the indenture pursuant to which the Debentures (defined below) were issued, the Debentures, our obligations under the Trust Agreement and its
obligations under the indenture to pay costs, expenses, debts and liabilities of the Issuer (other than with respect to the Convertible Preferred Securities) provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the Convertible Preferred
Securities. Proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Preferred Securities were invested in 6


/


%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures (the “Debentures”) due December 2, 2026 issued by us. The Issuer exists solely to issue the Convertible Preferred Securities and its own common securities (the “Common Securities”) and invest
the proceeds therefrom in the Debentures, which is its sole asset. Separate financial statements of the Issuer are not presented because of our guarantee described above; our management has concluded that such financial statements are not material
to investors as the Issuer is wholly owned and essentially has no independent operations.

Each of the Convertible Preferred Securities and the related debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at the
rate of 3.2537 shares per Convertible Preferred Security


HOST MARRIOTT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(equivalent to a conversion price of $15.367 per share of our common stock). The Issuer will only convert Debentures pursuant to a notice of conversion by a
holder of Convertible Preferred Securities. During 2003 and 2002, no shares were converted to common stock. During 2001, 400 shares were converted into common stock. The conversion ratio and price have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the
distribution of shares of Crestline common stock and our common stock in connection with the REIT conversion.

Holders of the Convertible Preferred Securities are entitled to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 6


/


% accruing from the original issue date, commencing March 1, 1997, and payable quarterly in arrears thereafter. The distribution rate and the distribution and other payment dates for the Convertible Preferred Securities correspond to
the interest rate and interest and other payment dates on the Debentures. We may defer interest payments on the Debentures for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters. If interest payments on the Debentures are deferred, so too are payments
on the Convertible Preferred Securities. Under this circumstance, we will not be permitted to declare or pay any cash distributions with respect to our capital stock or debt securities that rank pari passu with or junior to the Debentures.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Convertible
Preferred Securities are redeemable at the Issuer’s option upon any redemption by us of the Debentures after December 2, 1999. Upon repayment at maturity or as a result of the acceleration of the Debentures upon the occurrence of a default, the
Convertible Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption.

In connection with consummation of the REIT conversion, the operating partnership assumed primary liability for repayment of the Debentures underlying the Convertible Preferred Securities. Upon conversion by a Convertible Preferred
Securities holder, we will issue shares of our common stock, which will be delivered to such holder. Upon the issuance of such shares by us, the operating partnership will issue to us a number of OP Units equal to the number of shares of our common
stock issued in exchange for the Debentures. There were no shares of Convertible Preferred Securities repurchased in 2003 and 2002.

Shareholders’ Equity

Seven hundred fifty million shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share, are authorized, of which 320.3 million and 263.7 million,
respectively, were outstanding as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. Fifty million shares of no par value preferred stock are authorized, with 14.1 million shares outstanding as of December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Dividend.

Our policy on paying dividends is
generally to distribute the minimum amount of taxable income necessary to maintain REIT status. Further, dividends on both common and preferred shares were restricted to the minimum amount of distributions required to maintain our REIT status as a
result of restrictions under our senior notes indenture. Annual preferred dividends were $2.50 per share in 2003 and 2002, and there were no common dividends paid in 2003 or 2002.

Common Stock and OP Units.

During October 2003 and August 2003, we sold 23.5 million and 27.5
million shares of our common stock, respectively, at a price to the public of $10.75 and $9.25 per share, respectively. The net proceeds from the sale were $250 million and $251 million, respectively, after payment of the underwriting discount and
offering expenses.

During February 2002, we filed a shelf
registration statement for 1.1 million shares of our common stock to be issued in exchange for partnership interests held by the minority partners in the partnership that owns the San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina. On March 15, 2002, the minority
partners sold the 1.1 million common shares to an underwriter for resale on the open market. We did not receive any proceeds as a result of these transactions. Concurrent with the issuance of the common shares, the operating partnership issued to us
an equivalent number


HOST MARRIOTT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

of OP Units. Also, in April 2002, we acquired an additional interest in the partnership through the issuance of 6.9 million OP Units to certain minority
partners in exchange for their partnership interests in the San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina.

Preferred Stock.

We currently have three classes of publicly-traded preferred stock outstanding. There are 4,160,000 shares
of 10% Class A preferred stock, which were sold in August 1999; 4,000,000 shares of 10% Class B preferred stock, which were sold in November 1999; and 5,980,000 shares of 10% Class C preferred stock, which were sold in March 2001. Holders of all
classes of the preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at a rate of 10% per annum of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference and are payable quarterly in arrears. After August 3, 2004, April 29, 2005 and March 27, 2006
we have the option to redeem the Class A preferred stock, Class B preferred stock and Class C preferred stock, respectively, for $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of redemption. The preferred stock classes rank senior
to the common stock and the authorized Series A junior participating preferred stock (discussed below), and on a parity with each other. The preferred stockholders generally have no voting rights. Accrued preferred dividends at December 31, 2003
were $8.8 million.

Shareholders Rights
Plan.

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan (as amended December 24, 1998) under which a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right was distributed for each outstanding share of our
common stock. Each right when exercisable entitles the holder to buy 1/1,000

th

of a share of a Series A junior
participating preferred stock of ours at an exercise price of $55 per share, subject to adjustment. The rights are exercisable 10 days after a person or group acquired beneficial ownership of at least 20%, or began a tender or exchange offer for at
least 20%, of our common stock. Shares owned by a person or group on November 3, 1998 and held continuously thereafter are exempt for purposes of determining beneficial ownership under the rights plan. The rights are non-voting and expire on
November 22, 2008, unless exercised or previously redeemed by us for $.005 each. If we were involved in a merger or certain other business combinations not approved by the Board of Directors, each right entitles its holder, other than the acquiring
person or group, to purchase common stock of either our company or the acquiror having a value of twice the exercise price of the right.

7.

Income Taxes

In December 1998, we restructured ourselves to enable us to qualify for treatment as a REIT effective January 1, 1999, pursuant to the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In general, a corporation that elects REIT status and meets certain tax law requirements regarding distribution of its taxable income to its shareholders as prescribed by applicable tax laws and complies with
certain other requirements (relating primarily to the nature of its assets and the sources of its revenues) is not subject to Federal income taxation on its operating income to the extent it distributes at least 90% of its taxable income. In
addition to paying Federal and state taxes on any retained income, we are subject to taxes on “built-in-gains” on sales of certain assets, if any. Additionally, our consolidated taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to Federal, state and
foreign income tax. The consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes, primarily, the tax provision related to the operations of the taxable REIT subsidiaries, Federal and state taxes on any undistributed taxable income, and international
taxes at the operating partnership, as well as each of their respective subsidiaries.

Where required, deferred income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases of
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only
to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies.

Total deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 were as follows:

The valuation
allowance required under SFAS 109 primarily represents a net operating loss carryforward of a foreign affiliate (“NOL”) the benefit of which was not previously recorded, but which has been recorded under SFAS 109 as a deferred tax asset

rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 were as follows:

At December 31, 2003
we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $80 million which expire in 2023.

On July 20, 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed a lower court
ruling that allowed us to carryback a 1991 specified liability loss to the tax years 1984 and 1985 resulting in a net income tax refund of $16 million. We recorded the refund as a benefit to the provision in 2001. In addition, we settled with the
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) all other outstanding Federal income tax issues for the tax years through 1998. We made net payments to the IRS of approximately $19 million in 2001 related to these settlements.

A reconciliation of the statutory Federal tax (provision) benefit to our
income tax (provision) benefit for continuing operations follows:

Cash paid for income
taxes, including IRS settlements, net of refunds received, was $21 million, $2 million and $24 million, respectively, in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

8.

Leases

Hotel Leases.

During 1999, 2000 and part of 2001, we leased our hotels (the “Leases”) to one or more third party
lessees (the “Lessees”), primarily subsidiaries of Crestline, due to Federal income tax law restrictions on a REIT’s ability to derive revenues directly from the operation of a hotel. Effective January 1, 2001, the REIT Modernization
Act amended the tax laws to permit REITs to lease hotels to a subsidiary that qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Accordingly, a TRS acquired the Crestline lessee entities owning the leasehold interests with respect to 116 of our full-service
hotels during January 2001 and acquired the lessee entities owning the leasehold interest with respect to four of our full-service hotels from Crestline (one lease) and Wyndham (three leases) during June of 2001. As a result, our revenues reflect
hotel level sales instead of rental income.

Hospitality
Properties Trust Relationship

.    In a series of related transactions in 1995 and 1996, we sold and leased back 53 Courtyard properties and 18 Residence Inns to Hospitality Properties Trust (“HPT”). These leases,
which are accounted for as operating leases and are included in the table below, have initial terms expiring through 2012 for the Courtyard properties and 2010 for the Residence Inn properties, and are renewable at our option. Minimum rent payments
are $54 million annually for the Courtyard properties and $18 million annually for the Residence Inn properties, and additional rent based upon sales levels are payable to HPT under the terms of the leases.

In connection with our conversion to a REIT, the operating partnership sublet
the HPT hotels (the “Subleases”) to separate sublessee subsidiaries of Crestline (the “Sublessee”), subject to the terms of the applicable HPT lease. The term of each Sublease expires simultaneously with the expiration of the
initial term of the HPT lease to which it relates and automatically renews for the corresponding renewal term under the HPT lease, unless either the HPT lessee (the “Sublessor”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership,
elects not to renew the HPT lease, or the Sublessee elects not to renew the Sublease at the expiration of the initial


HOST MARRIOTT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

term provided, however, that neither party can elect to terminate fewer than all of the Subleases in a particular pool of HPT hotels (one for Courtyard
hotels and one for Residence Inn hotels). Rent payable by Crestline under the Sublease consists of the minimum rent payable under the HPT lease and an additional percentage rent payable to us. The percentage rent payable by the Sublessor is
generally sufficient to cover the additional rent due under the HPT lease, with any excess being retained by the Sublessor. The rent payable under the Subleases is guaranteed by Crestline, up to a maximum amount of $30 million, which is allocated
between the two pools of HPT hotels.

Other Lease
Information.

A number of our hotels are subject to long-term ground leases, generally with multiple renewal options, all of which are accounted for as operating leases. Certain of these leases contain provisions for the
payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts. We also have leases on facilities used in our former restaurant business, some of which we subsequently subleased. These leases and subleases contain one
or more renewal options, generally for five or 10-year periods. Our lease activities also include leases entered into by our hotels for various types of equipment, such as computer equipment, vehicles and telephone systems. The restaurant and
equipment leases are accounted for as either operating or capital leases, depending on the characteristics of the particular lease arrangement.

The following table presents the future minimum annual rental commitments
required under non-cancelable leases for which we are the lessee as of December 31, 2003. Minimum payments for capital leases have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurant subleases of $2 million, payable to us under
non-cancelable subleases. Minimum payments for the operating leases have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and HPT subleases of $27 million and $618 million, respectively, payable to us under non-cancelable
subleases.

The ground lease on
the New York Marriott Marquis, which was renegotiated in 1999, provides for the payment of a percentage of the hotel sales (4% in 1999 and 5% thereafter) through 2007 and an equivalent of real estate taxes on the property from 2008 through 2017,
which is to be used to amortize the 1999 deferred ground rent obligation of $116 million. We have the right to purchase the land under certain circumstances for approximately $25 million, of which $4 million has already been paid. The balance of the
deferred ground rent obligation was $52 million and $63 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and 2002 and is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

We remain contingently liable on certain leases relating to divested
non-lodging properties. Such contingent liabilities aggregated $40 million at December 31, 2003. However, management considers the likelihood of any material funding related to these leases to be remote.

Employee Stock Plans

At December 31, 2003, we maintained two stock-based compensation plans, including the comprehensive stock plan (the “Comprehensive Plan”),
whereby we may award to participating employees (i) options to purchase our common stock, (ii) deferred shares of our common stock and (iii) restricted shares of our common stock, and the employee stock purchase plan. At December 31, 2003, there
were approximately 12 million shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance under the Comprehensive Plan.

Prior to 2002, we accounted for expense under these plans according to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations. Consequently, no compensation expense was recognized for stock options issued under the Comprehensive Plan or stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan. In the third quarter of 2002, we implemented the expense recognition
provisions of SFAS 123 with retroactive application to employee stock options granted on or after January 1, 2002 only. Options granted in fiscal years prior to 2002 will continue to be accounted for using the intrinsic value method as described in
APB 25. As a result of the change in accounting method, we now record compensation expense for employee stock options based on the fair value of the options at the date of grant. We also record compensation expense for shares issued under our
employee stock purchase plan. The implementation of SFAS 123 had no effect on the calculation of compensation expense for shares granted under deferred stock and restricted stock plans. For additional information on the effects of this change in
accounting method, see Note 1.

Employee Stock
Options.

Employee stock options may be granted to officers and key employees with an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Non-qualified options generally expire up to
15 years after the date of grant. Most options vest ratably over each of the first four years following the date of the grant. In connection with the Marriott International distribution in 1993, we issued an equivalent number of Marriott
International options and adjusted the exercise prices of its options then outstanding based on the relative trading prices of shares of the common stock of the two companies.

In connection with the Host Marriott Services (“HM Services”) spin-off in 1995, outstanding options held by our
current and former employees were redenominated in both our and HM Services stock and the exercise prices of the options were adjusted based on the relative trading prices of shares of the common stock of the two companies. Pursuant to the
distribution agreement between us and HM Services, we originally had the right to receive up to 1.4 million shares of HM Services’ common stock or an equivalent cash value subsequent to exercise of the options held by certain former and current
employees of Marriott International. On August 27, 1999, Autogrill Acquisition Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Autogrill SpA of Italy, acquired HM Services. Since HM Services is no longer publicly traded, all future payments to us will be made in
cash, as HM Services has indicated that the receivable will not be settled in Autogrill SpA stock. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the receivable balance was approximately $6.1 million and $5.4 million, respectively, which is included in other
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

For
purposes of the following disclosures required by SFAS 123, the fair value of each stock option granted has been estimated on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. There were no stock options granted in 2003.


HOST MARRIOTT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following weighted average assumptions were used for grants issued during 2002 and 2001, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 3.8% and 5.2%,
volatility of 36% and 37%, expected lives of 15 and 12 years; and dividend yield of 6.0% and 9.1%. The weighted average fair value per option granted during the year was $1.41 in 2002 and $1.09 in 2001. As a result of the implementation of SFAS 123,
we recorded compensation expense of $274,000 and $47,000, respectively, for 2003 and 2002, which represents the expense for stock options granted as of January 1, 2002 only.

A summary of the status of our stock option plans that have been approved by our stockholders for 2003, 2002 and 2001
follows. We do not have stock option plans that have not been approved by our stockholders.

The following table
summarizes information about stock options at December 31, 2003:

Deferred
Stock.

Deferred stock incentive plan shares granted to officers and key employees after 1990 generally vest over 10 years in annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant. Certain employees may elect to
defer payments until termination or retirement. We accrue compensation expense for the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, less estimated forfeitures. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, 45,000, 23,000 and 24,000 shares, respectively, were
granted under this plan. The compensation cost that has been charged against income for deferred stock was not material for all periods presented. The weighted average fair value per share granted during each year was $8.00 in 2003, $9.95 in 2002
and $12.66 in 2001. The implementation of SFAS No. 123 had no impact on the calculation of compensation expense for the deferred stock incentive plan.

Restricted Stock.

From time to time, we award restricted stock shares under the Comprehensive Plan to officers and key
executives to be distributed over the next three years in annual installments based on continued employment and the attainment of certain performance criteria. We recognize compensation expense over the


HOST MARRIOTT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

restriction period equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of issuance adjusted for forfeitures, and where appropriate, the level of
attainment of performance criteria and fluctuations in the fair market value of our common stock. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, 3,183,000, 906,000 and 167,000 shares, respectively, of restricted stock plan shares were granted to certain key employees
under these terms and conditions. Approximately 1,069,000 and 623,000 shares, respectively, were forfeited in 2002 and 2001. No shares were forfeited in 2003. We recorded compensation expense of $15.0 million, $5.2 million and $7.6 million,
respectively, in 2003, 2002 and 2001 related to these awards. The weighted average grant date fair value per share granted during each year was $8.82 in 2003, $10.49 in 2002 and $12.91 in 2001. Under these awards 3,475,000 shares were outstanding at
December 31, 2003.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

.    Under the terms of the employee stock purchase plan, eligible employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at 90% of the lower of market value at the beginning or market value at the end of the plan
year, which runs from February 1 through January 31. As a result of the implementation of SFAS 123 during 2002, we now record compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan based on the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights,
which is estimated using an option-pricing model with the following assumptions for 2003 and 2002, respectively: Risk-free interest rate of 1.3% and 2.2%, volatility of 36% and 37%, expected life of one year, and dividend yield of 0% for both years.
For the 2003 and 2002 plan years, approximately 21,000 and 48,000 shares, respectively, were issued. The weighted average fair value of those purchase rights granted in 2003 and 2002 was $2.20 and $2.35, respectively. The compensation expense
reflected in net income was not material for all periods presented.

Stock Appreciation Rights

.    In 1998, 568,408 stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) were issued under the Comprehensive Plan to certain directors as a replacement for previously issued options that were
cancelled during the year. The conversion to SARs was completed in order to comply with ownership limits applicable to us upon conversion to a REIT. The SARs are fully vested and the grant prices range from $1.20 to $2.71. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, we
recognized compensation (income) expense for outstanding SARs as a result of fluctuations in the market price of our common stock of $1.6 million, $.8 million and $(1.2) million, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 439,000 SARs were
outstanding.

10.

Profit Sharing and Postemployment Benefit Plans

We contribute to defined contribution plans for the benefit of employees meeting certain eligibility requirements and electing participation in the plans.
The discretionary amount to be matched by us is determined annually by the Board of Directors. We provide medical benefits to a limited number of retired employees meeting restrictive eligibility requirements. Amounts for these items were not
material for the three years ended December 31, 2003.

11.

Discontinued Operations

Assets Held For Sale

.    During December 2003, we entered into a definitive, binding agreement to sell five hotels. We sold
three of these properties in January 2004. We have reclassified the assets and liabilities relating to these hotels as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. The following table sets forth the balance sheet detail
of these hotels (in millions):

Acquisitions

On November 13, 2003, we acquired the 806-room Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa for $321 million.

During June 2003, we acquired the remaining general partner interest and
preferred equity interest held by outside partners in the 772-room JW Marriott, Washington, D.C. for approximately $3 million. We also became the sole limited partner after the partnership foreclosed on a note receivable from the other limited
partner. As a result, we consolidated the partnership, and recorded property and equipment of $131 million and $95 million in mortgage debt on June 20, 2003.

During 2002, we acquired 80% of the outstanding minority interest in the partnership that owns the San Diego Marriott Marina and Hotel in exchange for 1.1
million shares of common stock and 6.9 million OP Units, which resulted in an increase to property and equipment of $66.6 million to reflect the fair value of the interest acquired. As a result of the acquisition, we now own approximately 90% of the
interests in the partnership that owns the hotel. We did not receive any proceeds as a result of these transactions.

On June 14, 2002, we acquired the 1,139-room Boston Marriott Copley Place for $214 million, including the assumption of $97 million in mortgage debt.

Marriott International Distribution and Relationship with Marriott International

We have entered into various agreements with Marriott International (formerly a wholly owned subsidiary, the common stock of
which was distributed to our shareholders on October 8, 1993) including the management of the majority of our hotels including franchised properties; financing for joint ventures including the acquisition in 1996 of two full-service properties in
Mexico City, Mexico for which Marriott International provided $29 million of debt financing and $28 million in preferred equity and the 2000 acquisition of two partnerships owning 120 limited-service hotels for a combined $372 million plus interest
and legal fees (see Note 3) and certain limited administrative services.

On July 25, 2002, we completed negotiations with Marriott International in connection with changes to the management and other agreements for substantially all of our Marriott and Ritz-Carlton managed hotels. The
changes were effective as of December 29, 2001. The management contract changes include providing us with additional approval rights over hotel operating budgets, capital budgets, shared service programs, and changes to certain system wide programs;
reducing the amount of working capital requirements, and expanding an existing agreement that allows us to fund furniture, fixtures and equipment expenditures from one account controlled by us, which collectively increased cash available to us for
general corporate purposes at that time by $125 million; reducing incentive management fees payable on certain Marriott managed hotels; reducing the amount we pay related to frequent guest programs; gradually reducing the amounts payable with
respect to various centrally administered programs; and providing additional territorial restrictions for certain hotels in eight markets.

In addition to these modifications, we have expanded the pool of hotels subject to an existing agreement that allows us to sell assets unencumbered by a
Marriott management agreement without the payment of termination fees. The revised pool includes 46 assets, 75% (measured by EBITDA) of which may be sold over approximately a ten year or greater period without the payment of a termination fee
(22.5%, measured by EBITDA, of which may be sold unencumbered by the Marriott brand).

In connection with these negotiations, we have amended our distribution agreement and stockholder rights plan to terminate Marriott International’s right to purchase up to 20% of each class of our outstanding
voting shares upon certain changes of control and clarified existing provisions in the management agreements that limit our ability to sell a hotel or our entire company to a competitor of Marriott International.

In 2003, 2002 and 2001, we paid Marriott International $136 million, $144
million and $162 million, respectively, in hotel management fees and $4 million, $5 million and $6 million, respectively, in franchise fees. In 2002 and 2001, we paid Marriott International $1 million and $2 million, respectively, for certain
administrative services and office space.

Hotel Management Agreements

Of our hotels, 87 are subject to management agreements under which Marriott International or one of their subsidiaries manages the hotels, generally for
an initial term of 15 to 20 years with renewal terms at the option of Marriott International of up to an additional 16 to 30 years. The agreements generally provide for payment of base management fees that are generally three percent of sales and
incentive management fees generally equal to 20% to 50% of operating profit (as defined in the agreements) over a priority return (as defined) to us, with total incentive management fees not to exceed 20% of cumulative operating profit, or 20% of
current year operating


HOST MARRIOTT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

profit. In the event of early termination of the agreements, Marriott International will receive additional fees based on the unexpired term and expected
future base and incentive management fees. We have the option to terminate certain management agreements if specified performance or extension thresholds are not satisfied. A single agreement may be canceled under certain conditions, although such
cancellation will not trigger the cancellation of any other agreement. Certain consolidated partnerships with a total of eight properties operate under a single agreement, cancellation of which would affect all the properties in these partnerships.

Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, Marriott
International furnishes the hotels with certain chain services which are generally provided on a central or regional basis to all hotels in the Marriott International hotel system. Chain services include central training, advertising and promotion,
a national reservation system, computerized payroll and accounting services, and such additional services as needed which may be more efficiently performed on a centralized basis. Costs and expenses incurred in providing such services are required
to be allocated among all domestic hotels managed, owned or leased by Marriott International or its subsidiaries on a fair and equitable basis. In addition, our hotels also participate in the Marriott Rewards program. The cost of this program is
charged to all hotels in the Marriott hotel system.

We are
obligated to provide the manager with sufficient funds, generally 5% of revenue, to cover the cost of (a) certain non-routine repairs and maintenance to the hotels which are normally capitalized; and (b) replacements and renewals to the hotels’
property and improvements. Under certain circumstances, we will be required to establish escrow accounts for such purposes under terms outlined in the agreements. To the extent we are not required to fund such amounts into escrow accounts, we remain
liable to make such fundings in the future.

We have franchise
agreements with Marriott International for two hotels. Pursuant to these franchise agreements, we generally pay a franchise fee based on a percentage of room sales and food and beverage sales, as well as certain other fees for advertising and
reservations. Franchise fees for room sales are approximately six percent of sales, while fees for food and beverage sales are approximately three percent of sales. The terms of the franchise agreements are from 15 to 30 years.

We hold management agreements with The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, LLC
(“Ritz-Carlton”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marriott International, to manage ten of our hotels. These agreements have an initial term of 15 to 25 years with renewal terms at the option of Ritz-Carlton of up to an additional 10 to 40
years. Base management fees vary from two to five percent of sales and incentive management fees, if any, are generally equal to 20% of available cash flow or operating profit, as defined in the agreements.

We also hold management agreements with hotel management companies other than
Marriott International and Ritz-Carlton for 15 of our hotels. These agreements generally provide for an initial term of 10 to 20 years with renewal terms at the option of either party or, in some cases, the hotel management company of up to an
additional one to 15 years. The agreements generally provide for payment of base management fees equal to one to four percent of sales. Fourteen of the fifteen agreements also provide for incentive management fees generally equal to 10 to 25 percent
of available cash flow, operating profit, or net operating income, as defined in the agreements.

Geographic and Business Segment Information

We consider each one of our full-service hotels to be an operating segment, none of which meets the threshold for a reportable segment. We also allocate
resources and assess operating performance based on individual hotels. All of our non-full-service hotel activities (primarily our limited-service leased hotels and office buildings) are immaterial. Accordingly, we report one business segment, hotel
ownership. Our foreign operations consist of four

properties located in Canada and two properties located in Mexico, one of which was sold in January 2004. There were no intercompany sales between us and the
foreign properties. The following table presents revenues and long-lived assets for each of the geographical areas in which we operate (in millions):

Guarantees

We have certain guarantees which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt that are not on our books due to various
dispositions, spin-offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party. We consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be
remote. The guarantees are listed below:

·

We remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non-lodging properties. These primarily represent divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee
of rental payments. The aggregate amount of these guaranteed payments is approximately $40 million as of December 31, 2003.

·

In 1997, we owned Leisure Park Venture Limited Partnership, which owns and operates a senior living facility. We spun-off the partnership as part of Crestline in the REIT
conversion, but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to $14.7 million of municipal bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority through their maturity in 2027. However, to the extent we are
required to make any payments under the guarantee, we have been indemnified by Crestline, who, in turn, is indemnified by the current owner of the facility.

·

We are required to maintain a letter of credit for $2.9 million to guarantee payment of certain expenses related to the mortgage for Hanover Marriott which is owned by one of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our mortgage lender is the beneficiary under the letter of credit which expires in April 2004.

·

On November 20, 2003, we sold the Jacksonville Marriott and the associated ground lease was assigned to the purchaser. We are contingently liable under the ground lease for amounts
not to exceed $2.25 million. However, the purchaser of the hotel has indemnified us against any payment on the ground lease. Further, if we pay the maximum amount of $2.25 million, the landlord would be required to deed the land to us.

18.

Mandatorily Redeemable Non-controlling Interests of All Entities

We consolidate five partnerships, the Philadelphia Market Street HMC Limited Partnership, or Market Street; the Pacific Gateway, Ltd, or San Diego; the
Lauderdale Beach Association or LBA; the Marriott Mexico City Partnership, or Mexico; and the East Side Hotel Associates, L.P., or East Side, with minority interest holders that have finite lives. The partnerships have lives ranging from 77 to 100
years and terminate between 2061 and 2097.

As of December 31,
2003, the minority interest holders in Market Street and San Diego had settlement alternatives in which they could be issued 367,909 and 1,616,000 OP Units, respectively, based on their ownership percentages of 1.58% and 10.03%, respectively, as
stipulated in their partnership agreements. At December 31, 2003, the OP Units were valued at $4.5 million and $19.9 million, respectively, for Market Street and San Diego. LBA, East Side and Mexico do not have any settlement alternatives. At
December 31, 2003, the fair values of the minority interests in these partnerships were approximately $114 million.

Subsequent Events

In January 2004, we redeemed approximately $218 million of Series C senior notes and made a partial prepayment of approximately $44 million on a mortgage
loan for two Ritz-Carlton properties. We recorded a loss of approximately $11 million related to the payment of the call premium and the acceleration of the related deferred financing fees in the first quarter of 2004.

In January 2004, we sold four hotels for total proceeds of approximately $80
million resulting in a minimal gain.

See the discussion of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in Note 1, “

Application of New Accounting Standards.”

The sum of the basic
and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for the four quarters in all years presented differs from the annual earnings per common share due to the required method of computing the weighted average number of shares in the respective periods.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and
procedures” in Rule 13a-14(c). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As
we do not control or manage these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
