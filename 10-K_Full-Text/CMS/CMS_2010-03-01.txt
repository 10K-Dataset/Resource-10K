PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

CMS
    Energy

CMS Energy was formed in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy
    company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent
    holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an
    electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a
    domestic IPP. Consumers serves individuals and businesses
    operating in the alternative energy, automotive, chemical,
    metal, and food products industries as well as a diversified
    group of other industries. CMS Enterprises, through its
    subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged primarily in IPP
    and owns power generation facilities fueled mostly by natural
    gas and biomass.

CMS Energy manages its businesses by the nature of services each
    provides and operates, principally in three business segments:
    electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises, its non-utility
    operations and investments. Consumers’ consolidated
    operations account for substantially all of CMS Energy’s
    total assets, income, and operating revenue. CMS Energy’s
    consolidated operating revenue was $6.2 billion in 2009,
    $6.8 billion in 2008, and $6.5 billion in 2007.

For further information about operating revenue, net operating
    income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to
    all of CMS Energy’s business segments and operations, see
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, CMS
    Energy Corporation’s Selected Financial Information,
    Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Consumers

Consumers was formed in Michigan in 1968 and is the successor to
    a corporation organized in Maine in 1910 that conducted business
    in Michigan from 1915 to 1968. Consumers owns and operates
    electric distribution and generation facilities and gas
    transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. It provides
    electricity

and/or

natural gas to 6.5 million of Michigan’s
    10 million residents. Consumers’ rates and certain
    other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of
    the MPSC and the FERC, as described in “CMS Energy and
    Consumers Regulation” in this Item 1.

Consumers’ consolidated operating revenue was
    $6.0 billion in 2009, $6.4 billion in 2008, and
    $6.1 billion in 2007. For further information about
    operating revenue, net operating income, and identifiable assets
    and liabilities attributable to Consumers’ electric and gas
    utility operations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data, Consumers Energy Company’s Selected
    Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consumers owns its principal properties in fee, except that most
    electric lines and gas mains are located below public roads or
    on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through
    easements and other rights. Almost all of Consumers’
    properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond
    Indenture. For additional information on Consumers’
    properties, see the “Business Segments” section of
    Consumers Electric Utility, Electric Utility Properties, and
    “Business Segments” section of Consumers Gas Utility,
    Gas Utility Properties described later in this Item 1.



In 2009, Consumers served 1.8 million electric customers
    and 1.7 million gas customers in Michigan’s Lower
    Peninsula. The following is a map of Consumers’ service
    territory:



BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

Consumers
    Electric Utility

Electric Utility Operations:

Consumers’
    electric utility operations, which include the generation,
    purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated
    operating revenue of $3.4 billion in 2009,
    $3.6 billion in 2008, and $3.4 billion in 2007.
    Consumers’ electric utility customer base consists of a mix
    of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers
    in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. The automotive industry
    represented five percent of Consumers’ 2009 electric
    utility operating revenue. The following is an illustration of
    Consumers’ 2009 electric utility operating revenue by
    customer class:

Consumers’ electric utility operations are not dependent on
    a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any
    one or even a few of its largest customers is not reasonably
    likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition.

In 2009, Consumers’ electric deliveries, excluding
    intersystem deliveries, were 36 million MWh, which included
    ROA deliveries of 2 million MWh. In 2008, Consumers’
    electric deliveries, excluding intersystem deliveries, were
    37 million MWh, which included ROA deliveries of
    2 million MWh. Consumers’ electric utility operations
    are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically
    increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air
    conditioners and other cooling equipment.



The following is an illustration of Consumers’ monthly
    weather-adjusted electric deliveries to its customers, including
    ROA deliveries, during 2009 and 2008:

Consumers’ 2009 summer peak demand was 7,756 MW, which
    includes ROA loads of 335 MW. For the

2008-09

winter period, Consumers’ peak demand was 5,857 MW,
    which includes ROA loads of 244 MW. As required by MISO
    reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through
    long-term contracts, capacity necessary to supply its projected
    firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2010.

Weighted average fuel costs

Consumers’ electric generating system is heavily dependent
    upon the availability of coal. In 2009, Consumers’ four
    coal-fueled generating sites burned 9 million tons of coal
    and produced a combined total of 17,255 GWh of electricity,
    which represented 96 percent of the energy generated by
    Consumers.

In order to obtain its coal requirements, Consumers enters into
    long-term and short-term physical coal supply contracts. At
    December 31, 2009, Consumers had six long-term and three
    spot-price contracts to purchase low-sulfur western coal through
    2012; these contracts total $233 million. Consumers also
    had four long-term and three spot-price contracts to purchase
    Appalachian coal through 2012; these contracts totaled
    $215 million. All of Consumers’ long-term contracts
    have fixed prices. Over the last ten years, Consumers has
    purchased 60 to 90 percent of its annual coal requirements
    through long-term contracts. At December 31, 2009,
    Consumers had 93 percent of its 2010 expected coal
    requirements under contract, as well as a

47-day

supply of coal on-hand.

In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases
    a fleet of rail cars and has long-term transportation contracts
    with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for
    delivery of purchased coal to Consumers’ generating
    facilities. Consumers’ coal transportation contracts expire
    from 2010 through 2014.

Consumers participates in the Midwest Energy Market. Consumers
    offers its generation into the market on a day-ahead and
    real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve its
    load. Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its
    generation capability with purchases from the market to meet its
    customers needs during peak demand periods.

At December 31, 2009, Consumers had unrecognized future
    commitments to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs
    with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly
    capacity payments based on the plants’ availability,
    whether or not power is delivered to Consumers, or
    deliverability. These payments for 2010 through 2030 total
    $13.2 billion and range from $780 million to
    $870 million annually for each of the next five



years. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability
    and fuel costs. For further information about Consumers’
    future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see
    Item 7. MD&A, “Capital Resources and
    Liquidity — Obligations and Commitments —
    Contractual Obligations.”

Consumers
    Gas Utility

Gas
    Utility Operations:

Consumers’ gas utility operations, which include the
    purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of
    natural gas, generated operating revenue of $2.6 billion in
    2009, $2.8 billion in 2008, and $2.6 billion in 2007.
    Consumers’ gas utility customer base consists of a mix of
    residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in
    Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. The following is an
    illustration of Consumers’ 2009 gas utility operating
    revenue by customer class:

Consumers’ gas utility operations are not dependent on a
    single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any
    one or even a few of its largest customers is not reasonably
    likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition.

In 2009, deliveries of natural gas sold through Consumers’
    pipeline and distribution network totaled 326 bcf, which
    included GCC deliveries of 27 bcf. In 2008, Consumers’
    deliveries of natural gas sold through its pipeline and
    distribution network totaled 344 bcf, which included GCC
    deliveries of 25 bcf. Consumers’ gas utility operations are
    seasonal. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the
    summer months for use during the winter months when the demand
    for natural gas is higher. During 2009, 43 percent of the
    natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter months
    was supplied from storage. Peak demand occurs in the winter due
    to colder temperatures



and the resulting use of heating fuels. The following is an
    illustration of Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted gas
    deliveries to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during
    2009 and 2008:

Gas Utility Properties:

Consumers’ gas
    distribution and transmission system located in Michigan’s
    Lower Peninsula consists of:

•

26,526 miles of distribution mains;

•

1,652 miles of transmission lines;

•

7 compressor stations with a total of 136,180 installed and
    available horsepower; and

•

15 gas storage fields with an aggregate storage capacity of 307
    bcf and a working storage capacity of 142 bcf.

Gas Supply:

In 2009, Consumers purchased
    69 percent of the gas it delivered from United States
    producers and 18 percent from Canadian producers.
    Authorized suppliers in the GCC program supplied the remaining
    13 percent of the gas that Consumers delivered.



The following illustration shows the sources of Consumers’
    gas supply during 2009:

Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR
    Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, L.P., Panhandle,
    Trunkline, and Vector Pipeline L.P. Consumers uses these
    contracts to deliver gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to
    its customers. Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts
    expire through 2017 and are capable of delivering
    80 percent of its total gas supply requirements.

Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply
    transportation under firm city-gate arrangements, incremental
    firm transportation contracts, and interruptible transportation
    contracts. The amount of interruptible transportation service
    and its use vary primarily with the price for this service and
    the availability and price of purchased and transported spot
    supplies. Consumers’ use of interruptible transportation is
    generally in off-peak summer months and after Consumers has
    fully utilized the services under the firm transportation
    agreements.

Enterprises —
    Non-Utility Operations and Investments

CMS Energy’s enterprises segment, through various
    subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged
    primarily in domestic IPP and the marketing of IPP. In 2007,
    enterprises made a significant change in business strategy by
    exiting the international marketplace and refocusing to
    concentrate on its independent power business in the United
    States.

The enterprises segment’s operating revenue included in
    Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s
    consolidated financial statements was $216 million in 2009,
    $365 million in 2008, and $370 million in 2007. The
    enterprises segment’s operating revenue included in Income
    (Loss) From Discontinued Operations in CMS Energy’s
    consolidated financial statements was $7 million in 2009,
    $14 million in 2008, and $248 million in 2007.



IPP:

CMS Generation invested in and operated
    non-utility power generation plants in the United States and
    abroad. In 2007, CMS Enterprises sold CMS Generation and all of
    CMS Enterprises’ international assets to third parties and
    transferred its domestic independent power plant operations to
    its subsidiary, HYDRA-CO. For more information on the asset
    sales, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 22,
    Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations, and Impairment Charges,
    “Asset Sales.”

The operating revenue from IPP included in Income (Loss) From
    Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s consolidated
    financial statements was $18 million in 2009,
    $22 million in 2008, and $28 million in 2007. The
    operating revenue from IPP included in Income (Loss) From
    Discontinued Operations in CMS Energy’s consolidated
    financial statements was $7 million in 2009,
    $14 million in 2008, and $137 million in 2007.

IPP Properties:

At December 31, 2009, CMS
    Energy had ownership interests in independent power plants
    totaling 1,202 gross MW or 1,079 net MW. (Net MW

    sells energy commodities in support of CMS Energy’s
    generating facilities. In 2004, CMS ERM discontinued its natural
    gas retail program as customer contracts expired, and changed
    its name from CMS MST to CMS ERM.

In 2009, CMS ERM marketed 23 bcf of natural gas and 1,726 GWh of
    electricity. CMS ERM’s operating revenue included in Income
    (Loss) From Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s
    consolidated financial statements was $198 million in 2009,
    $343 million in 2008, and $342 million in 2007.

Natural Gas Transmission:

CMS Gas Transmission
    owned, developed, and managed domestic and international natural
    gas facilities. In March 2007, CMS Gas Transmission sold a
    portfolio of its businesses in Argentina and its northern
    Michigan non-utility natural gas assets to Lucid Energy. In
    August 2007, CMS Gas Transmission sold its investment in
    GasAtacama to Endesa S.A. In June 2008, CMS Gas Transmission
    completed the sale of its investment in TGN. For more
    information on these asset sales, see Item 8. Financial

CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS REGULATION

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to
    regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign
    governmental agencies, including those described in the
    following sections.

MPSC

Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which
    regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail
    utility rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities,
    corporate mergers, and other matters.

The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC staff, and
    certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings
    concerning Consumers. The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, and
    others often appeal significant MPSC orders.

Rate Proceedings:

For information regarding open
    rate proceedings, see Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    Note 7, Utility Rate Matters.

Michigan Energy
    Legislation

The 2008 Energy Legislation requires that at least ten percent
    of Consumers’ electric sales volume come from renewable
    energy sources by 2015, and includes requirements for specific
    capacity additions. The 2008 Energy Legislation also requires
    Consumers to prepare an energy optimization plan and achieve
    annual sales reduction targets beginning in 2009 through at
    least 2015. The targets are incremental with the goal of
    achieving a six percent reduction in customers’ electricity
    use and a four percent reduction in customers’ natural gas
    use by December 31, 2015. In 2009, Consumers filed, and the
    MPSC approved, its renewable energy and energy optimization
    plans. For additional information regarding Consumers’
    renewable energy and energy optimization plans, see Item 7.
    MD&A, Outlook, “Consumers’ Electric Utility
    Business Outlook and Uncertainties.”

The 2008 Energy Legislation also reformed the Customer Choice
    Act to limit alternative energy suppliers to supplying no more
    than ten percent of Consumers’ weather-adjusted sales. In
    September 2009, the MPSC approved procedures for the
    administration and allocation of electric load allowed to be
    served by alternative electric suppliers under the 2008 Energy
    Legislation. The MPSC further clarified that electric choice
    customers that are served presently by an alternative electric
    supplier will not be returned automatically to utility service
    in the event that the ten percent of weather-adjusted sales cap
    is exceeded due to a reduction in utility sales during the year.
    The MPSC also required utilities to make available on their
    websites an electric choice cap tracking system that allows
    customers to check on the status of the program.

FERC

The FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several
    independent power plants and exempt wholesale generators in
    which CMS Enterprises has ownership interests, as well as over
    CMS ERM, CMS Gas Transmission, and DIG. Among other things, the
    FERC has jurisdiction over acquisitions, operations, and
    disposals of certain assets and facilities, services provided
    and rates charged, conduct among affiliates, and limited
    jurisdiction over holding company matters with respect to CMS
    Energy. The FERC, in connection with the NERC and with regional
    reliability organizations, also regulates generation owners and
    operators, load serving entities, purchase and sale entities,
    and others with regard to reliability of the bulk power system.
    Certain aspects of Consumers’ gas business are also subject
    to regulation by the FERC, including a blanket transportation
    tariff under which Consumers may transport gas in interstate
    commerce.



The FERC also regulates certain aspects of Consumers’
    electric operations, including compliance with the FERC
    accounting rules, wholesale rates, operation of licensed hydro
    electric generating plants, transfers of certain facilities,
    corporate mergers, and issuances of securities.

Other
    Regulation

The Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural
    gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to
    the FERC and the DOE’s Office of Fossil Fuels.

Consumers’ pipelines are subject to the Natural Gas
    Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and the Pipeline Safety Improvement
    Act of 2002, which regulate the safety of gas pipelines.

EnerBank is regulated by the FDIC.

CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to
    various federal, state, and local regulations for environmental
    quality, including air and water quality, solid waste
    management, and other matters. For additional information
    concerning environmental matters, see Item 1A. Risk Factors
    and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6,
    Contingencies and Commitments.

CMS Energy has recorded a significant liability for its
    affiliates’ obligations associated with Bay Harbor. For
    additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6, Contingencies
    and Commitments.

Air:

Consumers continues to install

state-of-the-art

emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants
    and to convert electric generating units to burn cleaner fuels.
    Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of
    $1.4 billion from 2010 through 2017 to comply with current
    and future federal and state regulations that will require
    extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides,
    particulate matter, and mercury emissions. Consumers’
    estimate may increase if additional laws or regulations are
    adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including
    carbon dioxide. For additional information concerning estimated
    capital expenditures related to environmental compliance, see
    Item 7. MD&A, Outlook, “Consumers’ Electric
    Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties — Electric
    Environmental Estimates.”

Solid Waste Disposal:

Costs related to the
    construction, operation, and closure of a modern solid waste
    disposal facility for ash are significant. To achieve
    significant reductions in ash field closure costs, Consumers has
    worked with others to reuse 30 percent of ash produced.
    Consumers sells coal ash for use as a Portland cement
    replacement in concrete products, as feedstock for the
    manufacture of Portland cement, and for other environmentally
    compatible uses. Consumers’ solid waste disposal areas are
    regulated under Michigan’s solid waste rules. Consumers has
    converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems,
    which substantially reduce landfill venting. All of
    Consumers’ ash facilities have programs designed to protect
    the environment and are subject to quarterly MDNRE inspections.
    Dike integrity and stability have been assessed by an
    independent consultant. The EPA has been considering the
    development of new federal regulations for ash disposal areas
    for several years.

Water:

Consumers uses significant amounts of water
    to operate and cool its electric generating plants. Water
    discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDNRE
    under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation,
    Consumers’ facilities have discharge monitoring programs.
    The EPA is developing new regulations related to cooling water
    intake systems. Consumers estimates expenditures of
    $150 million from 2010 through 2017 to comply with current
    and future regulations relating to cooling water intake systems.

CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS COMPETITION

Electric
    Competition

Consumers’ electric utility business is subject to actual
    and potential competition from many sources, in both the
    wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation,
    electric delivery, and retail services.

The Customer Choice Act allows all Consumers’ electric
    customers to buy electric generation service from Consumers or
    from an alternative electric supplier. The 2008 Energy
    Legislation revised the Customer Choice Act



and generally limits alternative electric supply to ten percent
    of Consumers’ weather-adjusted retail sales for the
    preceding calendar year. In August 2009, customer enrollment in
    the ROA program reached the ten-percent limit. Electric
    deliveries from alternative suppliers reached the ten-percent
    limit in early January 2010.

Consumers also has competition or potential competition from:

•

industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their
    production capacity outside Consumers’ service territory
    for economic reasons;

•

municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery
    systems;

•

customer self-generation; and

•

adjacent utilities that extend lines to customers in contiguous
    service territories.

Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in
    adjacent areas and monitoring compliance with the MPSC’s
    and the FERC’s rules, providing non-energy services, and
    providing tariff-based incentives that support economic
    development.

Consumers offers non-energy revenue-producing services to
    electric customers, municipalities, and other utilities in an
    effort to offset costs. These services include engineering and
    consulting, construction of customer-owned distribution
    facilities, sales of equipment (such as transformers), power
    quality analysis, energy management services, meter reading, and
    joint construction for phone and cable. In these activities,
    Consumers faces competition from many sources, including energy
    management services companies, other utilities, contractors, and
    retail merchandisers.

CMS ERM continues to focus on optimizing CMS Energy’s IPP
    portfolio. CMS Energy’s IPP business faces competition from
    generators, marketers and brokers, and other utilities marketing
    power in the wholesale market.

Gas
    Competition

Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas
    utility business. Competition comes from other gas suppliers
    taking advantage of direct access to Consumers’ customers
    and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane,
    oil, and electricity.

INSURANCE

CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain
    insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in
    the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject
    to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not
    fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses. A
    portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or
    Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions
    that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS Energy or Consumers
    renews its policies, it is possible that some of the current
    insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on
    commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance
    markets.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ current insurance program
    does not cover the risks of certain environmental cleanup costs
    and environmental damages, such as claims for air pollution,
    damage to sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, and some
    long-term storage or disposal of wastes.

ITEM 1A. RISK
    FACTORS

Actual results in future periods for CMS Energy and Consumers
    could differ materially from historical results and the
    forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors
    that might cause or contribute to these differences include, but
    are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections.
    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses are influenced
    by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve
    uncertainties that may materially affect results and are often
    beyond their control. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known or that the companies’ management believes
    to be immaterial may also adversely affect the companies. The
    risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the
    other information included in this report and in other documents
    filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making
    an investment in securities of CMS Energy or Consumers. Risk
    factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMS Energy. All of
    these risk factors are potentially significant.

CMS
    Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its
    debt service obligations.

Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on
    dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and
    other payment obligations. Restrictions contained in
    Consumers’ preferred stock provisions and other legal
    restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of
    incorporation and FERC requirements, limit Consumers’
    ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS
    Energy. At December 31, 2009, Consumers had
    $333 million of unrestricted retained earnings available to
    pay common stock dividends. If sufficient dividends are not paid
    to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy may not be able to
    generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations,
    which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s
    liquidity and financial condition.

CMS
    Energy has substantial indebtedness that could limit its
    financial flexibility and hence its ability to meet its debt
    service obligations.

At December 31, 2009, CMS Energy, including Consumers, had
    $6.6 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness,
    including $34 million of subordinated indebtedness relating
    to its convertible preferred securities. CMS Energy had
    $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness at
    December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, there were
    $25 million of borrowings and $3 million of letters of
    credit outstanding under CMS Energy’s revolving credit
    agreement. CMS Energy and its subsidiaries may incur additional
    indebtedness in the future.

The level of CMS Energy’s present and future indebtedness
    could have several important effects on its future operations,
    including, among others:

•

a significant portion of its cash flow from operations will be
    dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its
    indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes;

•

covenants contained in its existing debt arrangements require it
    to meet certain financial tests, which may affect its
    flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its
    business;

•

its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital,
    capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and
    other purposes may be limited;

•

it may be at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that
    are less leveraged;

•

its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions
    may increase; and

•

its future credit ratings may fluctuate.

CMS Energy’s ability to meet its debt service obligations
    and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future
    performance, which will be subject to general economic
    conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory
    decisions (including with respect to environmental matters), and
    financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations,
    many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make
    assurances that its business will continue to generate
    sufficient cash flow from operations to service its
    indebtedness. If CMS Energy is unable to generate sufficient
    cash flows from operations, it may be required to sell assets or
    obtain additional



financing. CMS Energy cannot ensure that additional financing
    will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.

CMS
    Energy cannot predict the outcome of regulatory reviews and
    claims regarding its participation in the development of Bay
    Harbor.

The EPA and the MDNRE have not completed their review of
    proposals by CMS Land and CMS Capital to remedy the flow of
    leachate from buried CKD piles at the site to Lake Michigan and
    related environmental issues. In addition, CMS Land and CMS
    Capital have not arrived at a final and long-term solution to
    the disposal of leachate collected at the site. CMS Land and CMS
    Capital, the MDNRE, the EPA, and other parties are having
    ongoing negotiations concerning these subjects. These
    negotiations are focused on, among other things, issues related
    to:

•

options for the disposal of leachate;

•

the capping and excavation of CKD;

•

the location and design of collection lines and upstream
    diversion of water;

•

potential flow of leachate below the collection system;

•

applicable criteria for various substances such as
    mercury; and

•

other matters that are likely to affect the scope of remedial
    work that CMS Land and CMS Capital may be obligated to undertake.

Depending on the results of these negotiations, as well as any
    indemnification obligation or liability under an AOC signed by
    CMS Land and CMS Capital, or other liability under environmental
    laws, adverse outcomes of some or all of these matters could
    have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s liquidity
    and financial condition and could negatively affect CMS
    Energy’s financial results.

CMS
    Energy may be affected adversely by a regulatory investigation
    and civil lawsuits regarding pricing information that CMS MST
    and CMS Field Services provided to market
    publications.

In 2002, CMS Energy notified appropriate regulatory and
    governmental agencies that some employees at CMS MST and CMS
    Field Services appeared to have provided inaccurate information
    regarding natural gas trades to various energy industry
    publications which compile and report index prices. CMS Energy
    is cooperating with an ongoing investigation by the DOJ
    regarding this matter. CMS Energy is unable to predict the
    outcome of the DOJ investigation and what effect, if any, the
    investigation will have on CMS Energy.

CMS Energy, CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas,
    Inc. (the company that purchased CMS Field Services) and Cantera
    Gas Company were named as defendants in various lawsuits arising
    as a result of alleged false natural gas price reporting.
    Allegations included manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures
    and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies, and artificial
    inflation of natural gas retail prices in California, Colorado,
    Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. CMS Energy cannot
    predict the outcome of the lawsuits. It is possible that the
    outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material
    adverse effect on CMS Energy’s liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers retain contingent liabilities in connection
    with their asset sales.

The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the
    sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are
    required to:

•

retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes,
    pensions, or environmental conditions;

•

indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the
    inaccuracy of representations and warranties they make; and

•

make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of
    post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews.



Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for
    extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending
    on the extent to which the buyers may ultimately seek to enforce
    their rights under these contractual provisions, and the
    resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a
    material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to
    obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. Potential
    disruption in the capital and credit markets could have an
    adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    businesses, including the availability and cost of short-term
    funds for liquidity requirements and their ability to meet
    long-term commitments. These consequences could have an adverse
    effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands
    under commercial commitments, guarantees, indemnities, and
    letters of credit. Consumers’ capital requirements are
    expected to be substantial over the next several years as it
    implements generation and environmental projects, and such
    requirements may increase if additional laws or regulations are
    adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including
    carbon dioxide.

CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, as well as
    on the banking syndications, to meet their financial commitments
    and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not
    available from CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ respective
    operations. CMS Energy and Consumers also use letters of credit
    issued under certain of their revolving credit facilities to
    support certain operations and investments.

Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a
    result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced
    alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions
    could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    access to liquidity needed for their respective businesses. Any
    disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take
    measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until
    alternative credit arrangements or other funding for their
    business needs can be arranged. These measures could include
    deferring capital expenditures, changing CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ commodity purchasing strategy to avoid
    collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating
    future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other
    discretionary uses of cash.

CMS Energy continues to explore financing opportunities to
    supplement its financial plan. These potential opportunities
    include refinancing

and/or

issuing new capital markets debt, preferred stock

and/or

common equity, and bank financing. Similarly, Consumers plans to
    seek funds through the capital markets, commercial lenders, and
    leasing arrangements. Entering into new financings is subject in
    part to capital market receptivity to utility industry
    securities in general and to Consumers’ securities
    issuances in particular. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot
    guarantee the capital markets’ acceptance of their
    securities or predict the impact of factors beyond their
    control, such as actions of rating agencies. If CMS Energy or
    Consumers is unable to obtain bank financing or access the
    capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness, or is unable
    to obtain commercially reasonable terms for any such financing,
    there could be a material adverse effect on its liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

Certain of CMS Energy’s securities and those of its
    affiliates, including Consumers, are rated by various credit
    rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of
    its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS
    Energy’s or Consumers’ ability to access capital on
    acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could
    make its cost of borrowing higher, and could cause CMS Energy or
    Consumers to reduce its capital expenditures. If it is unable to
    maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers may
    have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain of its
    suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers
    provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments
    affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit
    ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy’s credit
    ratings. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of
    their current ratings will remain in effect for any given period
    of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
    entirely by a rating agency.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers could incur significant costs to comply
    with environmental requirements.

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to
    costly and increasingly stringent environmental regulations.
    They believe that environmental laws and regulations related to
    greenhouse gas emissions, ash disposal,



and cooling water use will continue to become more stringent and
    require them to make additional significant capital expenditures
    for emissions control equipment installation and upgrades.

In December 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment finding for
    greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. In this finding, which
    has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.
    C. Circuit by numerous parties, the EPA determined that current
    and projected atmospheric concentrations of six greenhouse gases
    threaten the public health and welfare of current and future
    generations. The finding alone does not impose any standard or
    regulation on industry, but it is a precursor for finalizing
    proposed emissions standards. Presently, the EPA acknowledges
    that comprehensive federal legislation is the preferred method
    of addressing greenhouse gases. In June 2009, the United States
    House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and
    Security Act, which would require reductions in emissions of
    greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. This or similar
    legislation is considered likely to be enacted in some form and
    could have a significant impact on the operation and cost of
    existing and future fossil-fueled power plants.

In 2009, a significant percentage of the energy generated by
    Consumers came from fossil-fueled power plants. The emissions
    from fossil-fueled power plants would be subject to greenhouse
    gas regulations. CMS Enterprises also has interests in
    fossil-fueled power plants and other types of power plants that
    produce greenhouse gases. Federal laws and rules limiting the
    emission of greenhouse gases or similar state laws and rules, if
    enacted, as well as international accords and treaties, could
    require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment
    for emission controls, purchase carbon emissions allowances,
    curtail operations, invest in non-fossil-fuel generating
    capacity, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the
    emission of greenhouse gases. The following risks related to
    climate change could also have a material adverse impact on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ results of operations and
    financial position:

•

litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy,
    Consumers, or their subsidiaries due to CMS Energy’s or
    Consumers’ greenhouse gas emissions;

•

impairment of CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ reputation
    due to their greenhouse gas emissions and public perception of
    their response to potential greenhouse gas regulations, rules,
    and legislation;

•

extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms, that may
    affect customer demand, company operations, or assets.

The EPA is considering regulating coal combustion products, such
    as coal ash, as hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation
    and Recovery Act. Michigan already regulates coal combustion
    products as low hazard industrial waste. If coal ash is
    regulated as a hazardous waste, Consumers would likely cease the
    beneficial re-use of this product, resulting in significantly
    more coal ash requiring costly disposal. Additionally, it is
    possible that existing landfills could be closed if the upgrades
    to hazardous waste landfill standards are economically
    prohibitive. Costs associated with this potential regulation
    could be substantial.

The EPA is revising regulations that govern cooling water intake
    structures aimed at protecting aquatic life. Costs associated
    with these revisions could be material to CMS Energy, Consumers,
    and CMS Enterprises and result in operational changes or the
    retirement of certain generating units.

CMS Energy and Consumers expect to collect fully from their
    customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred
    to comply with environmental regulations. If Consumers were
    unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, it
    could negatively affect CMS Energy’s and/or Consumers’
    liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition and
    CMS Energy and/or Consumers could be required to seek
    significant additional financing to fund these expenditures.

Market
    performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit
    plan assets, which then could require significant
    funding.

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of
    assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations
    under CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ pension and
    postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have
    significant obligations under these plans and hold significant
    assets in these trusts. These assets are



subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns,
    which may fall below CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the
    assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to
    measure the required minimum funding levels may increase the
    funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in
    demographics, including increased number of retirements or
    changes in life expectancy assumptions, may increase the funding
    requirements of the obligations related to the pension and
    postretirement benefit plans. If CMS Energy and Consumers were
    unable to manage their pension and postretirement plan assets
    successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on their
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

Periodic
    reviews of the values of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    assets could result in accounting charges.

CMS Energy and Consumers are required by GAAP to review
    periodically the carrying value of their assets, including those
    that may be sold. Market conditions, the operational
    characteristics of their assets, and other factors could result
    in recording impairment charges for their assets, which could
    have an adverse effect on their stockholders’ equity and
    their access to additional financing. In addition, CMS Energy
    and Consumers may be required to record impairment charges at
    the time they sell assets, depending on the sale prices they are
    able to secure and other factors.

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses have safety
    risks.

Consumers’ gas and electric delivery systems, power plants,
    gas infrastructure, and energy products could be involved in
    accidents that result in injury or property loss to customers,
    employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have
    insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon
    the nature or severity of any incident or accident, CMS Energy
    or Consumers could suffer financial loss, damage to their
    reputations, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies
    or other public authorities.

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ revenues and results of
    operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control,
    including but not limited to natural disasters, terrorist
    attacks or related acts of war, hostile cyber intrusions, or
    other catastrophic events.

The impact of natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts, cyber
    intrusions, and other catastrophic events on the facilities and
    operations of CMS Energy and Consumers could have an adverse
    affect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of
    operations. A terrorist attack on physical infrastructure, or a
    major natural disaster, could result in severe damage to CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ assets beyond what could be
    recovered through insurance policies. Hostile cyber intrusions,
    including those targeting information systems as well as
    distributed electronic control systems, could severely disrupt
    business operations and result in loss of service to customers,
    as well as significant expense to repair security breaches or
    system damage. Terrorist attacks or acts of war could result in
    the disruption of power and fuel markets that could increase
    costs or disrupt service. Instability in the financial markets
    as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, credit crises,
    recessions, or other factors, could have a material adverse
    effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational
    risks.

Consumers is actively engaged in multiple regulatory oversight
    processes and has a large electric and gas customer base. As a
    result, Consumers has a highly visible public profile in
    Michigan. Consumers and CMS Energy could suffer negative impacts
    to their reputations as a result of operational incidents,
    violations of corporate compliance policies, regulatory
    violations, or other events. This could have a material adverse
    effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations. It could also
    result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory
    oversight.

Energy
    risk management strategies may not be effective in managing fuel
    and electricity pricing risks, which could result in
    unanticipated liabilities to Consumers and CMS Energy or
    increased volatility of their earnings.

Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural
    gas, coal, electricity, emission allowances, and RECs. Prices
    for natural gas, coal, electricity, emission allowances, and
    RECs may fluctuate substantially over



relatively short periods of time and expose Consumers to
    commodity price risk. A substantial portion of Consumers’
    operating expenses for its plants consists of the costs of
    obtaining these commodities. Consumers manages these risks using
    established policies and procedures, and it may use various
    contracts to manage these risks, including swaps, options,
    futures and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that
    these strategies will be successful in managing Consumers’
    pricing risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to
    Consumers as a result of future volatility in these markets.

Natural gas prices in particular have been historically
    volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate
    exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and
    changes in commodity prices associated with its gas distribution
    business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the
    GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover
    prudently incurred costs associated with those positions.
    Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of its
    operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the
    ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends
    on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the
    commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers may not be able to
    execute its risk management strategies, which could result in
    greater unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To
    the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity
    prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of
    operations.

Changes
    in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying
    potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively
    impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of
    operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments
    regarding the potential tax effects of various financial
    transactions and results of operations in order to estimate
    their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations
    include income, real estate, sales and use taxes,
    employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these
    tax matters. The judgments include reserves for potential
    adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken
    that may be subject to challenge by the IRS

and/or

other
    taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues
    related to these reserves at CMS Energy or Consumers could have
    a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial condition,
    and results of operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws.
    Increases in local, state, or federal tax rates or other changes
    in tax laws could have adverse impacts on their liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

Consumers
    is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in
    its service territories.

Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are affected
    by the economic conditions of the customers they serve. In
    Consumers’ service territories in Michigan, the economy has
    been affected adversely by the continued downturn and
    uncertainty in the automotive industry and relatively high
    unemployment. Michigan’s economy has also been affected
    negatively by the uncertainty in the financial and credit
    markets. If economic conditions in Michigan or the region
    continue to decline, Consumers may experience reduced demand for
    electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased
    earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in
    Consumers’ service territory affect its collections of
    accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas, which in
    turn impact its liquidity, financial condition, and results of
    operations.

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ energy sales and operations
    are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions
    from year to year.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses are seasonal.
    Demand for electricity is greater in the summer and winter
    months associated with cooling and heating, and demand for
    natural gas peaks in the winter heating season. Accordingly,
    their overall results in the future may fluctuate substantially
    on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling
    season and winter heating season could have an adverse affect on
    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations. Consumers expects that the
    pilot decoupling mechanism adopted in the November 2009 MPSC
    electric rate order may mitigate partially somewhat the impacts
    of these seasonal factors.



Unplanned
    power plant outages may be costly for Consumers.

When unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or
    other equipment, Consumers may be required to incur unplanned
    expenses and to make spot market purchases of electricity that
    exceed its costs of generation. If Consumers were unable to
    recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a
    material adverse effect on Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

Consumers
    may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal or natural
    gas, which could limit its ability to operate its electric
    generation facilities or serve its natural gas
    customers.

Consumers is dependent on coal for a portion of its electric
    generating capacity. While Consumers has coal supply and
    transportation contracts in place, there can be no assurance
    that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their
    obligations to supply coal to Consumers. The suppliers under the
    agreements may experience financial or operational problems that
    inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers.
    In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be
    required to supply coal to Consumers under certain
    circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If
    Consumers were unable to obtain its coal requirements under
    existing or future coal supply and transportation contracts, it
    may be required to purchase coal at higher prices, or it may be
    forced to purchase electricity from higher cost generating
    resources in the Midwest Energy Market, which would increase
    Consumers’ working capital requirements.

Consumers has firm interstate transportation and supply
    agreements in place to facilitate deliveries of natural gas to
    its customers. There are financial penalties associated with the
    firm supply agreements that provide Consumers with monetary
    remedies in the event of supply disruptions. There are
    FERC-approved operational tariffs that cover the interstate
    natural gas delivery obligations of the interstate pipeline
    service providers. There are no additional assurances that the
    counterparties to these firm transportation and supply
    agreements will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas
    to Consumers. In addition, suppliers under these agreements may
    not be required to deliver natural gas to Consumers in certain
    circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If
    Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas supply
    requirements under existing or future natural gas supply and
    transportation contracts, it could be required to purchase
    natural gas at higher prices from other sources or implement its
    natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC, which would
    increase Consumers’ working capital requirements and
    decrease its natural gas revenues.

Electric
    industry regulation could have an adverse effect on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.

Federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed
    dramatically in the last two decades and could continue to
    change over the next several years. These changes could have a
    material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by,
    extensive federal and state utility regulation. In CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ business planning and
    management of operations, they must address the effects of
    existing and proposed regulation on their businesses and changes
    in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by federal
    and state legislatures, regional transmission organizations,
    utility regulators, and taxing authorities. Adoption of new
    regulations by federal or state agencies, or changes to current
    regulations and interpretations of these regulations, could have
    a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of
    operations.

There are multiple proceedings pending before the FERC involving
    transmission rates, regional transmission organizations, and
    electric bulk power markets and transmission. CMS Energy and
    Consumers cannot predict the impact of these electric industry
    restructuring proceedings on their liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

The 2008 Energy Legislation, among other things, imposed a limit
    of ten percent on ROA. Proposals have been made to raise that
    limit, which, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on
    Consumers’ business. Proposals also have been made to
    increase the electric sales volume that will be required from
    renewable energy sources. Other new legislation, regulations, or
    interpretations could change how the businesses of CMS Energy
    and Consumers operate, impact the ability of Consumers to
    recover costs through rate increases, or require CMS Energy or
    Consumers to incur additional expenses.



CMS
    Energy and Consumers are subject to rate
    regulation.

CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation.
    Electric and gas rates for their utilities are set by the MPSC
    and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. While
    Consumers is permitted by the 2008 Energy Legislation to
    self-implement rate changes six months after a rate filing with
    the MPSC, subject to certain limitations, if a final rate order
    from the MPSC provides for lower rates than Consumers
    self-implemented, Consumers must refund the difference, with
    interest.

In addition, Consumers’ plans for making significant
    capital investments, including modifications to meet new
    environmental requirements and investment in new generation,
    could be affected adversely, or could have an adverse effect on
    Consumers, if rate regulators fail to provide timely rate
    relief. Regulators seeking to avoid or minimize rate increases
    could resist raising customer rates sufficiently to permit
    Consumers to recover the full cost of modifications to meet
    environmental requirements and other prudent investments. In
    addition, because certain costs are mandated by state
    requirements for cost recovery, such as resource additions to
    meet the state’s renewable resource standard, regulators
    could be more inclined to oppose rate increases for other
    required items and investments. Rate regulators could also face
    pressure to avoid or limit rate increases if Michigan’s
    economy fails to improve or if Consumers’ customer base
    diminishes. In addition to potentially affecting Consumers’
    investment program, any limitation of cost recovery through
    rates would affect Consumers’ results of operations.

A further regulatory risk could arise from the MPSC’s
    recent adoption of a mechanism to decouple revenues from
    electricity sales, which Consumers also has requested for
    application to its gas business. The decoupling mechanism could
    create upward pressure on future rates, which could cause
    regulators to require Consumers to postpone revenue recovery. In
    its most recent general electric rate case, Consumers made use
    of the decoupling mechanism to limit its request for a revenue
    increase, which could result in deferral of revenue recovery.

The FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell
    electricity at market-based rates. Failure of CMS Energy and
    Consumers to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a
    timely manner could have a material adverse effect on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

The various risks associated with the MPSC and the FERC
    regulation of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses
    could have a substantial negative effect on the companies’
    investment plans and results of operations.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of those with
    whom they do business.

CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of
    counterparties with whom they do business. Adverse economic
    conditions affecting counterparties with whom CMS Energy and
    Consumers do business, or financial difficulties experienced by
    these counterparties, could impair the ability of these
    counterparties to pay for CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    services or fulfill their contractual obligations, including
    performance and payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers
    depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform
    services timely. Any delay or default in payment or performance
    of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect
    on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

In recent years, the capital and credit markets have experienced
    unprecedented high levels of volatility and disruption. Market
    disruption and volatility could have a negative impact on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ lenders, suppliers, and other
    counterparties, or Consumers’ customers, causing them to
    fail to meet their obligations. Adverse economic conditions
    could also have a negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMS
    Energy’s banking subsidiary, EnerBank.

CMS
    Energy could be required to pay cash to certain security holders
    in connection with the optional conversion of their convertible
    securities.

CMS Energy has issued four series of cash-convertible
    securities, of which an aggregate principal amount (or par value
    in the case of preferred stock) of $839 million was
    outstanding at December 31, 2009. If the trading price of
    CMS Energy’s common stock exceeds specified amounts at the
    end of a particular fiscal quarter, then holders of one or more
    series of these convertible securities will have the option to
    convert their securities in the following fiscal quarter, with
    the principal amount (or par value) payable in cash by CMS
    Energy. Accordingly, if these trading price minimums are
    satisfied and security holders exercise their conversion rights,
    CMS Energy may be required to



outlay a significant amount of cash to those security holders,
    which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s
    liquidity and financial condition.

Consumers
    has a significant capital investment program planned for the
    next five years.

Consumers’ planned investments include a new coal-fueled
    power generation plant, an advanced metering infrastructure
    program, renewable power generation, gas compression,
    environmental controls, and other electric and gas
    infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems. The success of these
    investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of
    factors including, but not limited to, effective cost and
    schedule management during implementation, changes in commodity
    and other prices, operational performance, changes in
    environmental, legislative and regulatory requirements and
    regulatory cost recovery. Consumers cannot predict the impact
    that any of these factors may have on the success of its capital
    investment program. It is possible that adverse events reflected
    in these factors could have a material adverse effect on
    Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of
    operations.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

This MD&A is a combined report of CMS Energy and Consumers.

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

CMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan.
    It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries,
    including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMS
    Enterprises, primarily a domestic IPP. Consumers’ electric
    utility operations include the generation, purchase,
    distribution, and sale of electricity and Consumers’ gas
    utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage,
    distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers’ customer
    base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and
    diversified industrial customers. CMS Enterprises, through its
    subsidiaries and equity investments, owns power generation
    facilities.

CMS Energy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature
    of services each provides. CMS Energy operates principally in
    three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and
    enterprises, its non-utility investments and operations.
    Consumers operates principally in two business segments:
    electric utility and gas utility.

CMS Energy and Consumers earn revenue and generate cash from
    operations by providing electric and natural gas utility
    services, electric distribution and generation, gas
    transmission, storage, and distribution, and other
    energy-related services. Their businesses are affected primarily
    by:

•

regulation and regulatory matters;

•

economic conditions;

•

weather, especially during the heating season;

•

energy commodity prices;

•

interest rates; and

•

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ securities credit ratings.

During the past several years, CMS Energy’s business
    strategy has emphasized improving its consolidated balance sheet
    and maintaining focus on its core strength, which is
    Consumers’ utility operations and service.

Consumers’ forecast calls for capital investments in excess
    of $7 billion from 2010 through 2014, with a key aspect of
    its strategy being the balanced energy initiative. The balanced
    energy initiative is a comprehensive energy resource plan to
    meet Consumers’ projected short-term and long-term electric
    power requirements with energy efficiency; demand management;
    expanded use of renewable energy; development of new power
    plants; pursuit of additional PPAs to complement existing
    generating sources; and potential retirement of older, less
    efficient generating units.

Among Consumers’ largest planned capital investments is its
    proposed new 830 MW coal-fueled power plant. In September
    2009, the MPSC staff issued a report to the MDNRE on
    Consumers’

needs-and-alternatives

analysis for the proposed coal-fueled plant, concluding that the
    long-term capacity need was unjustified without the retirement
    of certain existing coal-fueled power plants from its fleet and
    that the proposed coal-fueled plant is only one alternative out
    of a range of alternatives that Consumers may use to fill the
    projected capacity need. In December 2009, the MDNRE issued an
    air permit for the proposed coal-fueled plant, with the
    condition that Consumers retire 638 MW of its existing
    coal-fueled generation, and potentially an additional
    320 MW, depending on customer needs. The MDNRE’s
    condition regarding plant retirements is consistent with
    Consumers’ balanced energy initiative.

Consumers’ planned capital investments also include
    renewable energy projects. The 2008 Energy Legislation requires
    that at least ten percent of Consumers’ electric sales
    volume come from renewable energy sources by 2015, and includes
    requirements for specific capacity additions. In compliance with
    this legislation, Consumers filed a



renewable energy plan with the MPSC in February 2009 outlining
    its plans to build or contract for additional renewable energy
    capacity. At the same time, Consumers filed an energy
    optimization plan, also called for by the 2008 Energy
    Legislation, under which Consumers will promote energy
    efficiency and provide incentives to reduce customer usage. In
    May 2009, the MPSC approved the energy optimization plan and,
    with minor exceptions, the renewable energy plan.

Another significant planned capital investment is
    Consumers’ advanced metering infrastructure system, which
    will provide enhanced controls over and information about energy
    usage, as well as timely notification of service interruptions.
    Consumers is using a phased implementation approach that will
    allow it to analyze, test, and pilot the new technology prior to
    widespread investment and deployment.

Regulatory matters are a key aspect of CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ businesses, particularly Consumers’ rate
    cases and regulatory proceedings with the MPSC. The MPSC issued
    its final order in Consumers’ 2008 electric rate case,
    authorizing Consumers to increase its rates by $134 million
    annually. The order also requires Consumers to refund the
    remaining $73 million of proceeds from the April 2007 sale
    of Palisades. The order adopts a “pilot” decoupling
    mechanism that went into effect December 1, 2009, and
    which, subject to certain conditions, will allow rates to be
    adjusted to collect or refund the change in marginal revenue
    arising from the difference between the level of average sales
    per customer adopted in the order and actual average sales per
    customer. The order also adopts an uncollectible expense
    tracking mechanism, effective January 1, 2009.
    Additionally, in November 2009, Consumers self-implemented a gas
    rate increase in the annual amount of $89 million, subject
    to refund with interest. Consumers expects to receive a final
    MPSC rate order in its gas rate case in May 2010. Further, in
    January 2010, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC
    seeking an annual increase in electric revenue of
    $178 million based on an 11 percent authorized return
    on equity.

In an order issued in February 2010, the MPSC concluded that Big
    Rock decommissioning surcharges collected during a statutory
    rate freeze from 2001 through 2003 should have been deposited in
    a decommissioning trust fund. Consumers had filed an application
    with the MPSC in 2008 for recovery of a $44 million Big
    Rock decommissioning shortfall from customers. In its February
    order, the MPSC agreed that Consumers was entitled to the
    $44 million decommissioning shortfall, but concluded that
    Consumers had collected this amount previously through the
    decommissioning surcharge in effect during the rate freeze. To
    reflect the impacts of this MPSC rate order, Consumers has
    recognized an $86 million regulatory liability on its
    Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009, and a
    charge to income of $130 million.

Another significant area of regulation for CMS Energy and
    Consumers is environmental regulation. There is uncertainty
    associated with federal legislative and regulatory proposals
    related to the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions,
    particularly associated with fossil-fueled generation. Federal
    legislation is being considered to establish a cap and trade
    system, or alternatively, to tax carbon dioxide emissions. In
    addition, in December 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment
    finding that greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide,
    contribute to air pollution that may endanger the public health
    and welfare, thus setting the stage for regulation of carbon
    dioxide emissions under the Clean Air Act. The EPA is
    considering regulating coal combustion products, such as coal
    ash, as hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and
    Recovery Act. CMS Energy and Consumers are monitoring these
    developments for potential effects on their plans and operations.

In the future, CMS Energy will focus its strategy on:

•

investing in Consumers’ utility system;

•

growing earnings and operating cash flow while controlling
    operating and fuel costs; and

•

maintaining principles of safe, efficient operations, customer
    value, fair and timely regulation, and consistent financial
    performance.

In executing this strategy, CMS Energy and Consumers will need
    to overcome a Michigan economy that has been impacted adversely
    by the continued downturn and uncertainty in Michigan’s
    automotive industry marked by the bankruptcies of GM and
    Chrysler as well as high unemployment rates. The financial
    market crisis, the effects of which became evident in a global
    economic downturn during the fourth quarter of 2008, continues
    to result in a negative economic outlook. A range of possible
    outcomes exists due to the uncertain financial market
    environment



and ongoing government policy responses. Consumers expects that
    the “pilot” decoupling mechanism and the uncollectible
    expense tracking mechanism adopted in the November 2009 MPSC
    electric rate order will mitigate partially the impacts of these
    economic conditions on the electric utility. While CMS Energy
    and Consumers believe that their sources of liquidity will be
    sufficient to meet their requirements, they will continue to
    monitor developments in the financial and credit markets and
    government policy responses to those developments for potential
    implications for CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    businesses and their future financial needs.

In 2009, net income available to common stockholders was
    $218 million, compared with $284 million for 2008.
    Combined net income available to common stockholders for
    Consumers’ electric and gas utility segments decreased as
    the Big Rock decommissioning refund, decreased deliveries, and
    increased operating expenses more than offset the positive
    impact of rate orders and a favorable sales mix. Further
    decreasing net income available to common stockholders was an
    increase in projected Bay Harbor remediation costs. These
    decreases were offset partially by the expiration of an
    indemnity obligation related to discontinued operations.



Specific after-tax changes to net income available to common
    stockholders for 2009 versus 2008 are:

In 2008, net income available to common stockholders was
    $284 million, compared with a net loss available to common
    stockholders of $234 million for 2007. Combined net income
    available to common stockholders from Consumers’ electric
    and gas utility segments increased reflecting the positive
    impact of rate orders and the elimination of certain costs
    associated with the MCV PPA, offset partially by lower electric
    deliveries and increased depreciation expense. Further
    increasing net income available to common stockholders were the
    absence of activities associated with assets sold in 2007, the
    absence of costs associated with the termination of contracts in
    2007, and a reduction in corporate interest expense.

Electric deliveries and rate increase:

For 2009,
    electric delivery revenues decreased $6 million compared
    with 2008. The largest component of this decrease was a
    $99 million reduction in revenue due to the order received
    from the MPSC to refund revenue collected for Big Rock
    decommissioning. For more details regarding the Big Rock
    decommissioning order, see Note 7, Utility Rate Matters.
    This decrease was offset by a combined $153 million of
    additional revenues resulting primarily from the June 2008 rate
    order and from the November 2009 rate order for which a rate
    increase was self-implemented in May 2009. Also included in the
    $153 million of additional revenues were other rate-related
    items, including the elimination of a regulatory reserve. These
    items



were offset partially by a decrease in revenues resulting from a
    new rate design structure that provides lower winter and higher
    summer rates to encourage conservation.

These rate-related variances, together with a $30 million
    increase in revenues from a favorable sales mix, were offset
    partially by $87 million in lower deliveries. Deliveries to
    end-use customers were 35.8 billion kWh, a decrease of
    1.7 billion kWh or 4.5 percent compared with 2008,
    reflecting unfavorable economic conditions in Michigan.

Additionally, surcharge revenues and related reserves decreased
    $3 million in 2009, reflecting the absence of
    $12 million of retirement benefits expense recovered in
    revenue in 2008. Also contributing to the decrease in surcharge
    revenues were $10 million associated with the expiration of
    the surcharge for the electric restructuring implementation plan
    and a $7 million reduction in surcharge revenue related to
    the Customer Choice Act. These variances were offset partially
    by a $26 million increase in surcharge revenues resulting
    from the implementation of the energy optimization program in
    June 2009.

For 2008, electric delivery revenues increased $90 million
    compared with 2007 due to additional revenue of
    $168 million from the inclusion of Zeeland in rates and
    from the June 2008 rate order. This increase was offset
    partially by $59 million in lower deliveries, a
    $20 million decrease due to an unfavorable sales mix, and a
    $14 million decrease in non-commodity revenue due primarily
    to the absence, in 2008, of METC transmission services revenue.
    The METC transmission service agreement expired in April 2007.
    Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.5 billion kWh, a
    decrease of 1.3 billion kWh or 3.4 percent compared
    with 2007. Additionally, surcharge revenue increased
    $15 million due primarily to the April 2008 rate order
    allowing recovery of retirement benefits expense.

Power supply costs and related revenue:

For 2009,
    PSCR revenue decreased $1 million compared with 2008, due
    to a decrease in wholesale fuel recovery revenue.

For 2008, PSCR revenue increased $18 million compared with
    2007. The increase primarily reflects the absence of a 2007
    reduction to revenue made in response to the MPSC’s
    position that PSCR discounts given to Consumers’
    transitional primary rate customers could not be recovered under
    the PSCR mechanism.

Other income, net of expenses:

For 2009, other
    income increased $14 million compared with 2008. The
    increase was due to the absence, in 2009, of an $11 million
    impairment charge that recognized an

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair value of Consumers’ SERP investments,
    and $9 million in gains from land sales in 2009. These
    increases were offset partially by a decrease in interest income
    and related items of $6 million, primarily reflecting lower
    levels of short-term cash investments and a reduction of
    interest recorded on certain regulatory assets.

For 2008, other income decreased $46 million compared with
    2007. The decrease was due to reduced interest income of
    $22 million, primarily reflecting lower levels of
    short-term cash investments, and an $11 million impairment
    charge in 2008 that recognized an

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair value of Consumers’ SERP investments.
    Also contributing to the decrease was the absence, in 2008, of a
    $7 million gain recognized on Consumers’ SERP
    investments in 2007 and $6 million in related items
    reported in other income.

Maintenance and other operating expenses:

For 2009,
    maintenance and other operating expenses increased
    $77 million compared with 2008. The increase was due to
    cost increases for plant maintenance of $24 million,
    $23 million associated with the implementation of the
    energy optimization program in 2009, an $18 million
    increase in expenses for forestry and tree-trimming services,
    and the absence of an $18 million benefit from the sale of
    sulfur dioxide credits recognized in 2008. Also contributing to
    the increase was the absence of $17 million of RCP savings
    recorded in 2008 related to the MCV PPA. Additionally, pension
    and OPEB expenses increased $7 million, as a
    $19 million expense increase due to the unfavorable market
    performance of retirement benefit plan assets more than offset
    the absence of $12 million of expense associated with
    retirement benefits recovered in revenue in 2008. These
    increases were offset partially by a $24 million decrease
    in storm restoration, outside services, and other net expenses
    and a $6 million decrease in uncollectible accounts
    expense, which reflects the benefits of the tracking mechanism
    authorized in the November 2009 rate order.



For 2008, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased
    $78 million compared with 2007. The decrease was due to the
    absence, in 2008, of $44 million of costs that were no
    longer incurred under the MCV PPA and $35 million of
    operating expenses associated with Palisades, which was sold in
    April 2007. Also contributing to the decrease were an
    $18 million benefit from the sale of sulfur dioxide credits
    in 2008 and a reduction in other net expenses of
    $1 million. These decreases were offset partially by
    $12 million of higher retirement benefits expense resulting
    from the April 2008 MPSC order allowing recovery of certain
    costs through a surcharge and $8 million of higher
    uncollectible accounts expense.

Depreciation and amortization:

For 2009,
    depreciation and amortization expense increased $2 million
    compared with 2008. The increase was due to higher depreciation
    expense of $11 million from an increase in plant in
    service, offset partially due to lower amortization expense of
    $9 million on certain regulatory assets.

For 2008, depreciation and amortization expense increased
    $38 million compared with 2007. The increase was due to
    higher depreciation expense of $27 million from an increase
    in plant in service. Also contributing to the increase were
    $8 million due to higher amortization expense on certain
    regulatory assets and a $3 million increase in other
    related expenses.

General taxes:

For 2009, general taxes increased
    $10 million compared with 2008. The increase was due to
    increased property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending,
    offset partially by a reduction in sales and use tax.

For 2008, general taxes decreased $15 million compared with
    2007. The decrease was due to the absence, in 2008, of
    $23 million of Michigan Single Business Tax, which was
    replaced with the MBT effective January 1, 2008. The MBT is
    recorded within income taxes. The decrease was offset partially
    by $8 million of higher property tax expense, reflecting
    primarily higher capital spending.

Interest charges:

For 2009, interest charges
    increased $42 million compared with 2008. The increase
    resulted from higher expenses of $31 million due to the
    order received from the MPSC to refund revenue collected for Big
    Rock decommissioning, with interest. For more details regarding
    the Big Rock decommissioning order, see Note 7, Utility
    Rate Matters. Also contributing to the increase was
    $16 million associated with the issuance of debt in 2009,
    offset partially by a $5 million reduction in other
    interest expenses, including $4 million associated with the
    elimination of a reserve related to a transmission tariff.

For 2008, interest charges decreased $11 million compared
    with 2007, due to lower interest expense of $9 million
    associated with amounts to be refunded to customers as a result
    of the sale of Palisades. The MPSC order approving the Palisades
    PPA with Entergy directed Consumers to record interest on the
    unrefunded balances. Also contributing to the decrease was the
    absence, in 2008, of interest charges related to an IRS
    settlement of $4 million, offset partially by
    $2 million due to lower average debt levels in 2008.

Income taxes:

For 2009, income taxes decreased
    $47 million compared with 2008, reflecting $45 million
    associated with lower utility earnings in 2009. Also
    contributing to the decrease were a $7 million reduction in
    expenses related to research tax credits and a $2 million
    decrease related to the tax treatment of property, plant and
    equipment, as required by MPSC orders. These decreases were
    offset partially by a $7 million increase in the MBT.

For 2008, income taxes increased $53 million compared with
    2007. The increase reflects $47 million associated with
    higher utility earnings and $6 million due to the inclusion
    of the MBT.

Gas deliveries and rate increase:

For 2009, gas
    delivery revenue increased $29 million compared with 2008.
    The increase resulted from a combined $32 million of
    additional revenue from the December 2008 gas rate order and the
    November 2009 self-implemented rate increase. Also contributing
    to the increase was $12 million from a favorable sales mix.
    Additionally, surcharge revenues increased $16 million due
    to the implementation of the energy optimization program in June
    2009. These increases were offset partially by lower deliveries
    of $31 million. Gas deliveries, including miscellaneous
    transportation to end-use customers, were 284.3 bcf, a decrease
    of 19.4 bcf or 6.4 percent compared with 2008.

For 2008, gas delivery revenue increased $44 million
    compared with 2007. The increase was due to additional revenue
    of $33 million from the August 2007 and December 2008 gas
    rate orders. Also contributing to the increase were higher
    deliveries of $6 million and a favorable sales mix of
    $5 million. Gas deliveries, including miscellaneous
    transportation to end-use customers, were 303.7 bcf, an increase
    of 4.1 bcf or 1.4 percent compared with 2007.

Other income, net of expenses:

For 2009, other
    income increased $13 million compared with 2008. The
    increase was due to the absence, in 2009, of a $5 million
    impairment charge that recognized an

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair value of Consumers’ SERP investments,
    and increased interest income of $8 million in 2009
    relating to Consumers’ gas segment’s secured borrowing
    agreements.

For 2008, other income decreased $28 million compared with
    2007. The decrease was due to lower interest income of
    $16 million, reflecting lower short-term investments, and
    decreased interest income from Consumers’ gas
    segment’s secured borrowing agreements. Also contributing
    to the decrease were a $5 million impairment charge in 2008
    that recognized an

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair value of Consumers’ SERP investments, a
    decrease due to the absence, in 2008, of a $3 million gain
    recognized on Consumers’ SERP investments in 2007, and a
    $4 million decrease in other income related items.

Maintenance and other operating expenses:

For 2009,
    maintenance and other operating expenses increased
    $32 million compared with 2008. The increase was due to
    additional expenses of $14 million related to the
    implementation of the energy optimization program in 2009. Also
    contributing to the increase were higher OPEB expense of
    $12 million, reflecting unfavorable market performance of
    Consumers’ retirement benefit plan assets, and higher
    uncollectible accounts expense of $6 million.

For 2008, maintenance and other operating expenses increased
    $24 million compared with 2007. The increase was due to
    higher operating expenses across Consumers’ storage,
    transmission, and distribution systems of $15 million, and
    higher uncollectible accounts expense of $9 million.

Depreciation and amortization:

For 2009,
    depreciation and amortization expense decreased $18 million
    compared with 2008, due primarily to the December 2008 gas rate
    order, which reduced depreciation expense and delayed collection
    of an equal amount of depreciation in rates.

For 2008, depreciation and amortization expense increased
    $8 million compared with 2007 due primarily to higher
    depreciation expense associated with an increase in plant in
    service.



General taxes:

For 2009, general taxes increased
    $4 million compared with 2008, due to increased property
    taxes, reflecting higher capital spending, offset partially by a
    reduction in sales and use tax.

For 2008, general taxes decreased $7 million compared with
    2007. The decrease was due primarily to the absence, in 2008, of
    the Michigan Single Business Tax, which was replaced by the MBT
    effective January 1, 2008. The MBT is recorded within
    income taxes.

Interest charges:

For 2009, interest charges
    increased $5 million compared with 2008, due primarily to
    the issuance of debt in 2009.

For 2008, interest charges decreased $9 million compared
    with 2007 due primarily to lower average debt levels and a lower
    average interest rate in 2008.

Income taxes:

For 2009, income taxes increased
    $12 million compared with 2008. The increase reflects
    $8 million associated with higher utility earnings in 2009
    and a $4 million increase in the MBT.

For 2008, income taxes decreased $2 million compared with
    2007. The decrease reflects $3 million related to the tax
    treatment of items related to property, plant, and equipment, as
    required by the MPSC orders. This decrease was offset partially
    by a $1 million increase due to the inclusion of the MBT.

For 2009, enterprises recorded a net loss available to common
    stockholders of $7 million compared with net income
    available to common stockholders of $13 million in 2008.
    The change reflects an after-tax expense of $22 million
    resulting from an increase in projected future environmental
    remediation costs associated with Bay Harbor and $3 million
    of lower earnings due to depressed power demand and prices.
    These variances were offset partially by a $5 million
    increase to net income due primarily to lower operating and
    maintenance expense and the absence, in 2009, of a 2008
    impairment charge that recognized an

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair value of enterprises’ SERP investments.

For 2008, enterprises recorded net income available to common
    stockholders of $13 million compared with a net loss
    available to common stockholders of $412 million in 2007.
    The change reflects the absence of $217 million of costs
    incurred for the termination of certain electricity sales
    agreements and the rescission of a contract with Quicksilver
    recorded in 2007, and $33 million in cost savings in 2008
    resulting from the absence of certain sales and supply
    contracts, offset partially by an $8 million net decrease
    in

mark-to-market

activity, all at CMS ERM. Activities associated with the sale of
    international assets in 2007 further increased net income
    available to common stockholders in 2008 by $164 million,
    due to the absence of $122 million in net impairment
    charges and $46 million of tax expense on deferred earnings
    recognized in 2007. In addition, the absence, in 2008, of a
    $29 million after-tax expense resulting from an increase in
    projected future environmental remediation costs associated with
    Bay Harbor in 2007 was offset partially by a $9 million
    change associated with SERP investment activity, as a
    $4 million impairment charge that recognized an

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair value of enterprises’ SERP investments
    was recognized in 2008, compared with a $5 million gain on
    SERP investments in 2007.

For 2009, corporate interest and other net expenses decreased
    $5 million due to a gain recognized on the early retirement
    of CMS Energy’s long-term debt to related parties and lower
    fixed charges due to lower average debt levels. These items were
    offset partially by premiums paid on the early retirement of CMS
    Energy senior notes, the



absence of benefits recorded in 2008 related to the reduction of
    certain tax valuation allowances, and an increase in tax expense
    due to legislation related to the MBT.

For 2008, corporate interest and other net expenses increased
    $74 million, reflecting the absence of tax benefits related
    to the sale of CMS Energy’s international operations
    recognized in 2007 and reduced interest income in 2008. These
    items were offset partially by the absence, in 2008, of the
    reduction in fair value of notes receivable from GasAtacama and
    premiums paid on the early retirement of CMS Energy debt in
    2007, as well as reduced interest expense due to lower debt
    levels in 2008.

Discontinued
    Operations

For 2009, net income available to common stockholders from
    discontinued operations was $20 million, reflecting the
    expiration of a $28 million indemnity obligation related to
    a 2007 asset sale, offset partially by a loss of $8 million
    resulting primarily from the reclassification of an enterprises
    IPP located in Connecticut as held for sale.

For 2008, net income from discontinued operations was
    $1 million, reflecting the reclassification of an
    enterprises IPP located in Connecticut as held for sale. The
    $89 million net loss available to common stockholders from
    discontinued operations in 2007 represents the net loss on the
    disposal of international businesses sold in 2007.

CAPITAL
    RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Components of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ cash
    management plan include controlling operating expenses and
    capital expenditures and evaluating market conditions for
    financing opportunities, if needed. Recent major financing
    transactions and commitments are as follows:

•

In February 2009, Consumers retired $200 million of FMBs at
    maturity;

•

In March 2009, Consumers issued $500 million in FMBs;

•

In June 2009, CMS Energy issued $173 million in convertible
    senior notes and $300 million in senior notes, and early
    retired $144 million of its $178 million of long-term
    debt to related parties;

•

In July 2009, CMS Energy repurchased and early retired
    $233 million principal amount of the senior notes due 2010
    and $87 million principal amount of the senior notes due
    2011;

•

In August 2009, Consumers retired $150 million of FMBs at
    maturity;

•

In December 2009, CMS Energy’s $239 million preferred
    stock and $139 million 3.375 percent senior notes
    became convertible at the holders’ option for the first
    quarter of 2010; and

•

In January 2010, CMS Energy issued $300 million of
    6.25 percent senior notes due 2020.

Despite present market volatility, CMS Energy and Consumers
    expect to continue to have access to the financial and capital
    markets. Recent and upcoming credit renewals and maturities are
    as follows:

•

Consumers renewed its accounts receivable sales program in
    February 2010 through February 2011;

•

Consumers renewed its $150 million

364-day

revolving credit facility in August 2009;

•

Consumers renewed its letter of credit facility in the amount of
    $30 million in September 2009;

•

Consumers’ $500 million revolving credit facility is
    planned for renewal in 2012;

•

Consumers’ FMBs maturities are $250 million in 2010
    and $300 million in 2012;

•

Consumers’ tax-exempt pollution control revenue bond
    maturities are $58 million in 2010;

•

CMS Energy’s senior notes maturities are $67 million
    in 2010, $214 million in 2011, and $150 million in
    2012; and

•

CMS Energy’s $550 million revolving credit facility is
    planned for renewal in 2012.



CMS Energy and Consumers believe that their present level of
    cash and their expected cash flows from operating activities,
    together with access to sources of liquidity, will be sufficient
    to meet cash requirements. If access to the capital markets were
    to become diminished or otherwise restricted, CMS Energy and
    Consumers would implement contingency plans to address debt
    maturities, which could include reduced capital spending. For
    additional details, see Note 4, New Accounting Standards
    and Note 8, Financings and Capitalization.

Cash
    Position, Investing, and Financing

At December 31, 2009, CMS Energy had $122 million of

    consolidated VIEs. At December 31, 2009, Consumers had
    $61 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents,
    which included $22 million of restricted cash and cash
    equivalents.

CMS Energy’s primary ongoing source of cash is dividends
    and other distributions from its subsidiaries. Consumers paid
    $285 million in common stock dividends and CMS Enterprises
    paid $55 million in common stock dividends to CMS Energy
    for the year ended December 31, 2009. For details on

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash provided by
    operating activities at CMS Energy increased $291 million
    compared with 2008. This increase was due primarily to the
    absence in 2009 of a payment made by CMS ERM in 2008 to
    terminate electricity sales agreements and the changes affecting
    Consumers’ cash provided by operating activities described
    in the following paragraph.



For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash provided by
    operating activities at Consumers increased $49 million
    compared with 2008. This increase was due primarily to the
    impact of lower gas prices on inventory purchased in 2009,
    increased billings due to recent regulatory actions, the
    absence, in 2009, of refunds to customers of excess Palisades
    decommissioning funds, and other timing differences. These
    changes were offset partially by the pension contribution of
    $199 million and lower sales of accounts receivable in 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash provided by
    operating activities at CMS Energy increased $534 million
    compared with 2007. This increase was due primarily to increased
    earnings and the absence of CMS Energy’s payment to settle
    a shareholder class action lawsuit, offset partially by a
    payment made by CMS ERM, in 2008, to terminate electric sales
    contracts, and the changes affecting Consumers’ cash
    provided by operating activities described in the following
    paragraph.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash provided by
    operating activities at Consumers increased $433 million

    primarily to the absence, in 2008, of proceeds from asset sales
    and Consumers’ nuclear decommissioning funds. These
    increases were partially offset by a decrease in capital
    expenditures resulting from the absence, in 2008, of the Zeeland

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash used in
    financing activities at CMS Energy increased by
    $182 million compared with 2008. The increase in net cash
    used in financing activities was due primarily to an increase in
    net debt retirements.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash used in
    financing activities at Consumers decreased $74 million
    compared with 2008. This decrease was due primarily to a
    stockholder’s contribution from CMS Energy, offset
    partially by a decrease in net proceeds from borrowings.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash provided by
    financing activities at CMS Energy increased $837 million
    compared with 2007. This increase was due primarily to an
    increase in proceeds from long-term debt issuances combined with
    a decrease in long-term debt retirements.



For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash used in
    financing activities at Consumers increased $477 million
    compared with 2007. This increase was due primarily to the
    absence of contributions from CMS Energy in 2008, offset
    partially by an increase in net proceeds from long-term debt
    issuances.

For additional details on long-term debt activity, see
    Note 8, Financings and Capitalization.

Restrictive Covenants:

CMS Energy’s senior
    notes indenture requires it to maintain a minimum interest
    coverage ratio, as defined. CMS Energy’s $550 million
    revolving credit agreement requires it to maintain a maximum
    debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined, and a minimum interest
    coverage ratio, as defined. Consumers’ credit agreements
    require it to maintain a maximum debt to capital ratio, as
    defined. At December 31, 2009, no events of default had
    occurred with respect to any debt covenants, and CMS Energy and

For details related to benefit payments, see Note 12,
    Retirement Benefits.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ purchase obligations
    include long-term PPAs with various generating plants, which
    require CMS Energy and Consumers to make monthly capacity
    payments based on the plants’ availability or
    deliverability. These payments will approximate $36 million
    per month during 2010 for CMS Energy and $40 million per
    month during 2010 for Consumers. If a plant is not available to
    deliver electricity, CMS Energy and Consumers will not be
    obligated to make these payments for that period. For additional
    details on power supply costs, see “Consumers’
    Electric Utility Results of Operations” within this
    MD&A, Note 6, Contingencies and Commitments,

Capital Expenditures:

For planning purposes, CMS
    Energy and Consumers forecast capital expenditures over a
    three-year period. They may revise these estimates periodically
    due to a number of factors, including environmental regulations,
    business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and
    the ability to access capital. The following is a summary of CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ estimated capital
    expenditures, including lease commitments, for 2010 through 2012:

The following is an illustration of CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ planned capital spending for 2010 through 2012:

Off-Balance-Sheet
    Arrangements

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements:

CMS Energy,
    Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries enter into various
    arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate
    commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements
    include indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, and
    financial and performance guarantees. Indemnities are usually
    agreements to reimburse a counterparty that may incur losses due
    to outside claims or breach of contract terms. The maximum
    payment that could be required under a number of these indemnity
    obligations is not estimable. While CMS Energy and Consumers
    believe it is unlikely that they will incur any material losses
    related to indemnities they have not recorded as liabilities,
    they cannot predict the impact of these contingent obligations
    on their liquidity and financial condition. For additional
    details on these and other guarantee arrangements, see
    Note 6, Contingencies and Commitments,
    “Guarantees.”

Sale of Accounts Receivable:

Under Consumers’
    revolving accounts receivable sales program, Consumers may sell
    up to $250 million of accounts receivable, subject to
    certain eligibility requirements. At December 31, 2009,
    $250 million of accounts receivable were eligible for sale,
    of which $50 million were sold.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following accounting policies and related information are
    important to an understanding of CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ results of operations and financial condition
    and should be considered an integral part of their MD&A.
    For additional accounting policies, see Note 1, Significant
    Accounting Policies.

Use
    of Estimates and Assumptions

In the preparation of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions are
    used that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. CMS
    Energy and Consumers use



accounting estimates for asset valuations, depreciation,
    amortization, financial and derivative instruments, employee
    benefits, the effects of regulation, indemnifications, and
    contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimated results
    due to changes in the regulatory environment, regulatory
    decisions, lawsuits, competition, and other factors. CMS Energy
    and Consumers consider all relevant factors in making these
    assessments.

Fair Value Measurements:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    have assets and liabilities that are accounted for or disclosed
    at fair value. Fair value measurements incorporate assumptions
    that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
    liability, including assumptions about risk. Development of
    these assumptions requires significant judgment.

The most material of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ fair
    value measurements are of the SERP assets, derivative
    instruments, and pension and OPEB plan assets. For a detailed
    discussion of the methods used to calculate fair value
    measurements, see Note 5, Fair Value Measurements.

Income Taxes:

The amount of income taxes paid by CMS
    Energy is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and
    foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed
    assessments. An estimate of the potential outcome of any
    uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMS Energy believes
    adequate reserves have been provided for these exposures;
    however, future results may include favorable or unfavorable
    adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the
    assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation
    on potential assessments expire. Additionally, CMS Energy’s
    judgment as to the ability to recover its deferred tax assets
    may change. CMS Energy believes the valuation allowances related
    to its deferred tax assets are adequate, but future results may
    include favorable or unfavorable adjustments. As a result, CMS
    Energy’s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly
    over time.

Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments:

CMS
    Energy and Consumers assess the recoverability of their
    long-lived assets and equity method investments by performing
    impairment tests if certain triggering events occur or if there
    has been a decline in value that may be other than temporary.
    CMS Energy and Consumers base their evaluations of impairment on
    such indicators as:

•

the nature of the assets;

•

projected future economic benefits;

•

regulatory and political environments;

•

historical and future cash flow and profitability
    measurements; and

•

other external market conditions and factors.

The estimates CMS Energy and Consumers use may change over time,
    which could have a material impact on their consolidated
    financial statements. For additional details, see Note 22,
    Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations, and Impairment Charges.

Unbilled Revenues:

CMS Energy and Consumers estimate
    unbilled revenues by applying an average billed rate for each
    customer class based on actual billed volume distributions.
    Unbilled revenues, which are recorded as Accounts receivable on
    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ Consolidated Balance
    Sheets, were $477 million at December 31, 2009 and
    $507 million at December 31, 2008.

Accounting
    for the Effects of Industry Regulation

Because Consumers has regulated operations, it uses regulatory
    accounting to recognize the effects of the regulators’
    decisions on its financial statements. Consumers continually
    assesses whether future recovery of its regulatory assets is
    probable by considering communications and experience with its
    regulators and changes in the regulatory environment. If
    Consumers determined that recovery of a regulatory asset were
    not probable, Consumers would be required to write off the asset
    and immediately recognize the expense to earnings.

Consumers is allowed to self-implement new energy rates six
    months after a new rate case filing; however, the rates that
    Consumers self-implements may be subject to refund, with
    interest. Consumers recognizes revenue



associated with self-implemented rates. If Consumers considers
    it probable that it will be required to refund a portion of its
    self-implemented rates, it records a provision for revenue
    subject to refund. A final rate order could differ materially
    from Consumers’ estimates underlying its self-implemented
    rates, giving rise to accounting adjustments. Under accounting
    rules for prior period adjustments, CMS Energy and Consumers may
    need to record such differences, if they are specifically
    identifiable to prior interim periods, as revisions to those
    periods.

For additional details, see Note 3, Utility Regulation.

Financial
    and Derivative Instruments and Market Risk Information

Financial Instruments:

Debt and equity securities
    classified as

available-for-sale

are reported at fair value determined from quoted market prices.
    Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value
    of

available-for-sale

debt and equity securities are reported, net of tax, in equity
    as part of AOCL. Unrealized losses are excluded from earnings
    unless the related changes in fair value are determined to be
    other than temporary.

Derivative Instruments:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    account for certain contracts as derivative instruments. The
    criteria used to determine if an instrument qualifies for
    derivative accounting are complex and often require significant
    judgment in application. If a contract is a derivative and does
    not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, it is
    recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value.
    Each quarter, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to
    reflect any change in the fair value of the contract. For
    additional details on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    derivatives, see Note 11, Derivative Instruments.

CMS Energy and Consumers generally use information from external
    sources, such as quoted market prices and other valuation
    information to determine the fair value of their derivatives.
    For certain contracts, this information is not available and
    mathematical models are used to value the derivatives. The most
    material of CMS Energy’s derivative liabilities, an
    electricity sales agreement held by CMS ERM, extends beyond the
    term for which quoted electricity prices are available. Thus, to
    value this derivative, CMS Energy uses a valuation model that
    incorporates a proprietary forward pricing curve for electricity
    based on forward natural gas prices and an implied heat rate.
    The model incorporates discounting, credit, and modeling risks.
    The model is sensitive to electricity and natural gas forward
    prices, and the fair value of this derivative liability will
    increase as these forward prices increase. The model is adjusted
    each quarter to incorporate market data as it becomes available.

The fair values calculated for CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ derivatives may change significantly as
    commodity prices and volatilities change. The cash returns
    actually realized on derivatives may be different from their
    estimated fair values. For derivatives in an asset position,
    calculations of fair value include reserves of less than
    $1 million to reflect the credit risk of CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ counterparties. For derivatives in a
    liability position, calculations include reserves of less than
    $1 million to reflect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    own credit risk. For additional details on how the fair values
    of derivatives are determined, see Note 5, Fair Value
    Measurements.

The types of contracts typically classified as derivatives are
    interest rate swaps, financial transmission rights, fixed price
    fuel contracts, natural gas futures, electricity swaps, and
    forward and option contracts for electricity, natural gas, and
    foreign currencies. Most of CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ commodity purchase and sale contracts are not
    subject to derivative accounting because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units
    specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity
    or bcf of natural gas);

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales
    exception; or

•

there is not an active market for the commodity.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ coal purchase contracts
    are not derivatives because there is not an active market for
    the coal they purchase. If an active market for coal develops in
    the future, some of these contracts may qualify as derivatives.
    For Consumers, which is subject to regulatory accounting, the
    resulting

mark-to-market

gains and losses would be offset by changes in regulatory assets
    and liabilities and would not affect net income. For other
    subsidiaries, CMS Energy does not believe the resulting

mark-to-market

impact on earnings would be material.



Market Risk Information:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    are exposed to market risks including, but not limited to,
    changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and equity security
    prices. They may enter into various risk management contracts to
    limit exposure to these risks, including swaps, options,
    futures, and forward contracts. CMS Energy and Consumers enter
    into these contracts using established policies and procedures,
    under the direction of an executive oversight committee
    consisting of senior management representatives and a risk
    committee consisting of business unit managers.

These contracts contain credit risk, which is the risk that the
    counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations.
    CMS Energy and Consumers reduce this risk using established
    policies and procedures, such as evaluating counterparties’
    credit quality and setting collateral requirements as necessary.
    If terms permit, standard agreements are used that allow for the
    netting of positive and negative exposures associated with the
    same counterparty. Given these policies, current exposures, and
    credit reserves, CMS Energy and Consumers do not expect a
    material adverse effect on their financial position or future
    earnings because of counterparty nonperformance.

The following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss
    in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from financial
    instruments, including derivative contracts, assuming a
    hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices of ten
    percent. Potential losses could exceed the amounts shown in the
    sensitivity analyses if changes in market rates or prices were
    to exceed ten percent.

Interest Rate Risk:

CMS Energy and Consumers are
    exposed to interest rate risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate
    and variable-rate financing instruments, and from interest rate
    swap agreements. A combination of these instruments are used to
    manage this risk as deemed appropriate, based upon market
    conditions. These strategies are designed to provide and
    maintain a balance between risk and the lowest cost of capital.

Commodity Price Risk:

CMS Energy and Consumers are
    exposed to commodity price risk, which arises from fluctuations
    in the price of electricity, natural gas, coal, and other
    commodities. Commodity prices are influenced by a number of
    factors, including weather, changes in supply and demand, and
    liquidity of commodity markets. In order to manage commodity
    price risk, they may enter into various non-trading derivative
    contracts, such as forward purchase and sale contracts, options,
    and swaps.

Retirement
    Benefits

Pension:

CMS Energy and Consumers have external
    trust funds to provide retirement pension benefits to their
    employees under a non-contributory, defined benefit Pension
    Plan. On September 1, 2005, the defined benefit Pension
    Plan was closed to new participants and CMS Energy and Consumers
    implemented the qualified DCCP, which provides an employer
    contribution of five percent of base pay to the existing 401(k)
    plan. An employee contribution is not required to receive the
    plan’s employer cash contribution. All employees hired on
    or after September 1, 2005 participate in this plan as part
    of their retirement benefit program. Previous cash balance
    Pension Plan participants also participate in the DCCP as of
    September 1, 2005. Additional pay credits under the cash
    balance Pension Plan were discontinued as of that date.

401(k):

CMS Energy and Consumers provide an employer
    match in their 401(k) plan equal to 60 percent on eligible
    contributions up to the first six percent of an employee’s
    wages.

OPEB:

CMS Energy and Consumers provide
    postretirement health and life benefits under their OPEB plan to
    qualifying retired employees.

CMS Energy and Consumers record liabilities for pension and OPEB
    on their consolidated balance sheets at the present value of the
    future obligations, net of any plan assets. The calculation of
    the liabilities and associated expenses requires the expertise
    of actuaries, and requires many assumptions, including:

•

life expectancies;

•

discount rates;

•

expected long-term rate of return on plan assets;

•

rate of compensation increases; and

•

anticipated health care costs.

A change in these assumptions could change significantly CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ recorded liabilities and
    associated expenses.

    costs are recoverable through its general ratemaking process.
    Actual future pension cost and contributions will depend on
    future investment performance, changes in future discount rates,
    and various other factors related to the populations
    participating in the Pension Plan.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the Pension
    Plan assets by 0.25 percentage point (from
    8.00 percent to 7.75 percent) would increase estimated
    pension cost for 2010 by $3 million for both CMS Energy and
    Consumers. Lowering the discount rate by 0.25 percentage
    point (from 5.85 percent to 5.60 percent) would
    increase estimated pension cost for 2010 by $5 million for
    both CMS Energy and Consumers.

For additional details on postretirement benefits, see
    Note 12, Retirement Benefits.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

CMS Energy and Consumers are required to record the fair value
    of the cost to remove assets at the end of their useful lives if
    there is a legal obligation to remove them. CMS Energy and
    Consumers have legal obligations to remove some of their assets
    at the end of their useful lives. CMS Energy and Consumers
    calculate the fair value of ARO liabilities using an expected
    present value technique that reflects assumptions about costs,
    inflation, and profit margin that third parties would require to
    assume the obligation. CMS Energy and Consumers did not include
    market risk premiums in their ARO fair value estimates since
    reasonable estimates could not be made. If a five percent market
    risk premium were assumed, CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    ARO liability at December 31, 2009 would increase by
    $11 million.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the
    period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with
    indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. CMS Energy and
    Consumers have not recorded liabilities for assets that have
    insignificant cumulative disposal costs, such as substation
    batteries. For additional details, see Note 17, Asset
    Retirement Obligations.

OUTLOOK

Several business trends and uncertainties may affect CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ financial condition and
    results of operations. These trends and uncertainties could have
    a material impact on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position. For
    additional details regarding these and other uncertainties, see
    “Forward-Looking Statements and Information”,
    Item 1A. Risk Factors, and Note 6, Contingencies and
    Commitments.

Consumers’
    Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties

Balanced Energy Initiative:

Consumers’ balanced
    energy initiative is a comprehensive energy resource plan
    designed to meet its projected short-term and long-term electric
    power requirements through:

•

energy efficiency;



•

demand management;

•

expanded use of renewable energy;

•

development of new power plants and pursuit of additional PPAs
    to complement existing generating sources; and

•

retirement of older, less efficient generating units.

Consumers’ balanced energy initiative includes plans to
    build an 830 MW coal-fueled plant at its Karn/Weadock
    generating complex near Bay City, Michigan. Consumers expects
    the plant to be in operation in 2017 and plans to use
    five-eighths of the plant’s output to serve its own
    customers, with the remaining output to be committed to others.

In December 2009, the MDNRE approved an air permit for
    Consumers’ proposed coal-fueled plant. As outlined in the
    air permit, Consumers agreed to retire up to seven of its older,
    less-efficient generating units; this is consistent with
    Consumers’ balanced energy initiative. Consumers plans to
    retire five units or 638 MW within six months of
    commencement of operation of the new coal plant, with retirement
    of the additional two units or 320 MW dependent on customer
    need.

The 2008 Energy Legislation provided guidelines for the
    MPSC’s review and approval of energy resource plans and
    proposed power plants through the issuance of a certificate of
    need. Consumers plans to file a new case with the MPSC seeking a
    certificate of need that conforms to the 2008 Energy Legislation
    in 2010.

Renewable Energy Plan:

The 2008 Energy Legislation
    requires that at least ten percent of Consumers’ electric
    sales volume come from renewable energy sources by 2015, and
    includes requirements for specific capacity additions.
    Consumers’ renewable energy plan details how Consumers will
    meet these renewable energy standards for energy and capacity,
    with wind generation as Consumers’ primary resource.
    Consumers plans to build or contract for additional renewable
    energy capacity of 200 MW by December 31, 2013, and an
    additional 300 MW of renewable energy capacity by
    December 31, 2015. Under Consumers’ plan, half of the
    new renewable capacity will be obtained through long-term
    agreements to purchase power from third parties, with the
    remaining capacity to be supplied by facilities built and owned
    by Consumers.

Consumers has secured more than 58,000 acres of land
    easements in Michigan’s Tuscola and Mason Counties for
    potential wind generation development and is collecting wind
    speed and other meteorological data at the sites. Consumers will
    continue to seek opportunities for wind generation development
    in support of the renewable energy standard. Consumers has also
    executed agreements with six small-scale renewable energy
    suppliers for the purchase of 9.4 MW of renewable capacity
    and an estimated two percent of its long-term renewable energy
    needs. The MPSC has approved these agreements, enabling
    Consumers to recover the full costs of these contracts from its
    customers. Additionally, Consumers is in the process of
    reviewing proposals for capacity and energy from larger projects
    to meet its renewable capacity and energy needs through 2015.

Energy Optimization Plan:

The 2008 Energy
    Legislation also requires Consumers to achieve annual sales
    reduction targets through at least 2015. The targets are
    incremental with the goal of achieving a six percent reduction
    in customers’ electricity use and a four percent reduction
    in customers’ natural gas use by December 31, 2015.
    Consumers’ energy optimization plan details its proposals
    for energy cost savings among all customer classes through
    incentives to reduce customer usage by offering customer energy
    audits, rebates and discounts on purchase of highly efficient
    appliances, and other incentives and programs. In July 2009,
    Consumers launched its energy optimization program for
    residential customers.

Electric Customer Deliveries and
    Revenue:

Consumers’ electric customer deliveries
    are largely dependent on Michigan’s economy, which has
    suffered from economic and financial instability in the
    automotive and real estate sectors. Volatility in the financial
    and credit markets has also harmed the Michigan economy.

Consumers expects weather-adjusted electric deliveries to
    decrease in 2010 by one percent compared with 2009.
    Consumers’ outlook for 2010 includes continuing growth in
    deliveries to its largest customer, which produces semiconductor
    and solar energy components. Excluding this customer’s
    growth, Consumers expects weather-adjusted electric deliveries
    in 2010 to decrease three percent compared with 2009.
    Consumers’ outlook reflects



reduced deliveries associated with its investment in energy
    efficiency programs included in the 2008 Energy Legislation, as
    well as recent projections of Michigan’s economic
    conditions.

Consumers expects economic conditions to stabilize by the end of
    2010, resulting in electric deliveries remaining essentially
    unchanged through 2014. This reflects growth in electric
    deliveries offset by the predicted effects of energy efficiency
    programs and appliance efficiency standards. Actual deliveries
    will depend on:

•

energy conservation measures and results of energy efficiency
    programs;

•

fluctuations in weather; and

•

changes in economic conditions, including utilization and
    expansion or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population
    trends, and housing activity.

In its November 2009 order in Consumers’ electric rate
    case, the MPSC authorized Consumers to adopt a “pilot”
    decoupling mechanism beginning December 1, 2009. This
    mechanism, subject to certain conditions, allows Consumers to
    adjust its rates to collect or refund the change in marginal
    revenue arising from the difference between the level of average
    sales per customer adopted in the order and actual average sales
    per customer. The order also adopts an uncollectible expense
    tracking mechanism, effective January 1, 2009, that allows
    rates to be adjusted to collect or refund 80 percent of the
    difference between the level of uncollectible expense included
    in rates and actual uncollectible expense. Consumers expects
    these mechanisms to mitigate partially the effects of weather
    fluctuations, the economy, and energy efficiency programs on
    Consumers’ electric revenue in future periods. For details
    on this rate order, see Note 7, Utility Rate Matters,
    “Consumers’ Electric Utility Rate Matters.”

Electric ROA:

The Customer Choice Act allows
    Consumers’ electric customers to buy electric generation
    service from Consumers or from an alternative electric supplier.
    The 2008 Energy Legislation limited alternative electric supply
    to ten percent of Consumers’ weather-adjusted retail sales
    of the preceding calendar year. During 2009, customer enrollment
    in the ROA program reached the ten percent limit. At
    December 31, 2009, alternative electric suppliers were
    contracted to provide 854 MW of generation service to ROA
    customers.

Electric Environmental Estimates:

Consumers’
    operations are subject to various state and federal
    environmental laws and regulations. Generally, Consumers has
    been able to recover in customer rates its costs to operate its
    facilities in compliance with these laws and regulations.

Clean Air Act:

Consumers continues to focus on
    complying with the federal Clean Air Act and numerous state and
    federal environmental regulations, including CAIR, and state
    mercury air rules. Consumers estimates expenditures of
    $1.4 billion from 2010 through 2017 to comply with these
    regulations. Consumers expects to recover these costs in
    customer rates.

Clean Air Interstate Rule:

At this time, CAIR
    remains in effect, pending EPA revision. While the impacts of
    this revision are unknown, Consumers expects the EPA to propose
    stricter standards. A draft rule is expected in 2010.
    Consumers’ strategy to comply with CAIR involves the
    installation of

state-of-the-art

emission control equipment.

State and Federal Mercury Air Rules:

In 2005, the
    EPA issued CAMR, which required initial reductions of mercury
    emissions from coal-fueled electric generating plants by 2010
    and further reductions by 2018. A number of states and other
    entities appealed certain portions of CAMR to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In
    2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
    Columbia determined that the rules developed by the EPA were not
    consistent with the Clean Air Act. The EPA has initiated the
    development of a revised rule based on Maximum Achievable
    Control Technology, which is a method for establishing strict
    emissions limits based on the best performing controlled sources
    of air contaminants. A proposed rule is expected in 2010, at
    which time Consumers will have a better understanding of the
    potential impact.

In 2006, Michigan’s governor proposed a plan that would
    result in mercury emissions reductions of 90 percent by
    2015. In response to the governor’s proposal, the MDNRE
    promulgated a rule that became effective in October 2009.
    Consumers has a plan in place to comply with this rule.

Greenhouse Gases:

In June 2009, the United States
    House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and
    Security Act, which would require reductions in emissions of
    greenhouse gases, including carbon



dioxide. The bill proposes to reduce carbon dioxide and other
    greenhouse gas emissions by 3 percent below 2005 levels by
    2012, 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and
    42 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The bill also
    contains provisions for the direct granting of substantial free
    greenhouse gas emission allowances to load-serving entities,
    which would mitigate some of the price impact to Consumers’
    customers. Consumers believes Congress may pass greenhouse gas
    legislation, but the form and timing of any final bill is
    difficult to predict. These laws, EPA regulations regarding
    greenhouse gases, or similar treaties, state laws, or rules, if
    enacted, could require Consumers to replace equipment, install
    additional equipment for emission controls, purchase allowances,
    curtail operations, arrange for alternative sources of supply,
    or take other steps to manage or lower the emission of
    greenhouse gases.

In September 2009, the EPA finalized the Mandatory Reporting of
    Greenhouse Gases Rule. This rule will require facilities
    producing 25,000 metric tons or more of greenhouse gases to
    collect emissions data under a new reporting system. The first
    reports will be due to the EPA on March 31, 2011. The rule
    covers carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydro
    fluorocarbons, and other fluorinated gases. The purpose of the
    rule is to collect accurate and timely data on greenhouse gas
    emissions that can be used to inform future climate change
    policy decisions.

In December 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment finding for
    greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. In this finding, which
    has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.
    C. Circuit by numerous parties, the EPA determined that current
    and projected atmospheric concentrations of six greenhouse gases
    threaten the public health and welfare of current and future
    generations. The finding alone does not impose any standard or
    regulation on industry, but it is a precursor for finalizing
    proposed emissions standards. Presently, the EPA acknowledges
    that comprehensive federal legislation is the preferred method
    of addressing greenhouse gases. In 2009, carbon dioxide
    emissions from fossil-fueled power plants owned by Consumers,
    excluding the portion of Campbell Unit 3 that is owned by
    others, exceeded 17 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.
    During the same period, coal-fueled plants owned by enterprises
    emitted 620,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

Although associated capital or operating costs relating to
    greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could be material and
    cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to recover
    these costs and capital expenditures in rates consistent with
    the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with
    environmental laws and regulations.

Water:

In 2004, the EPA issued rules that govern
    existing electric generating plant cooling water intake systems.
    These rules require a significant reduction in the number of
    fish harmed by cooling water intake structures at existing power
    plants. The EPA compliance options in the rule were challenged
    before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
    which remanded the bulk of the rule back to the EPA for
    reconsideration in 2007. In April 2009, the U.S. Supreme
    Court ruled in favor of the utility industry’s position
    that the EPA can rely on a cost-benefit analysis in setting the
    national performance standards for fish protection. The EPA has
    announced plans to issue a revised draft rule in 2010. Consumers
    estimates capital expenditures of $150 million to comply
    with these regulations.

Other electric environmental matters, including routine
    maintenance classification, could have a major impact on
    Consumers’ outlook. For additional details on these and
    other electric environmental matters, see Note 6,
    Contingencies and Commitments, “Consumers’ Electric
    Utility Contingencies — Electric Environmental
    Matters.”

Electric Rate Matters:

Rate matters are critical to
    Consumers’ electric utility business. For details on
    Consumers’ PSCR, electric rate case and self-implemented
    rates, electric operation and maintenance expenditures
    show-cause order, Big Rock decommissioning proceedings, and
    electric depreciation case, see Note 7, Utility Rate
    Matters, “Consumers’ Electric Utility Rate
    Matters.”

Consumers’
    Gas Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties

Gas Deliveries:

Consumers expects weather-adjusted
    gas deliveries to decline in 2010 by two percent compared with
    2009, due to continuing conservation and overall economic
    conditions in Michigan. In addition, Consumers expects
    weather-adjusted gas deliveries to decline an average of two
    percent annually from 2011



through 2015, which includes expected effects of energy
    efficiency programs. Actual delivery levels from year to year
    may vary from this trend due to:

•

fluctuations in weather;

•

use by IPP;

•

availability and development of renewable energy sources;

•

changes in gas prices;

•

Michigan economic conditions including population trends and
    housing activity;

•

the price of competing energy sources or fuels; and

•

energy efficiency and conservation.

Gas Environmental Estimates:

Consumers expects to
    incur investigation and remedial action costs at a number of
    sites, including 23 former manufactured gas plant sites. For
    additional details, see Note 6, Contingencies and
    Commitments, “Consumers’ Gas Utility
    Contingencies — Gas Environmental Matters.”

The Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule requires
    facilities engaging in the distribution of natural gas to
    collect data on greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the
    combustion of natural gas. In 2009, Consumers estimated that
    carbon dioxide emissions from its customers were 16 million
    metric tons.

Gas Rate Matters:

Rate matters are critical to
    Consumers’ gas utility business. For details on
    Consumers’ GCR, gas depreciation, and gas rate case, see
    Note 7, Utility Rate Matters, “Consumers’ Gas
    Utility Rate Matters.”

Enterprises’
    Outlook and Uncertainties

The primary focus with respect to CMS Energy’s remaining
    non-utility businesses is to optimize cash flow and maximize the
    value of their assets.

Trends and uncertainties that could have a material impact on
    CMS Energy’s consolidated income, cash flows, or financial
    position include:

•

the impact of indemnity and environmental remediation
    obligations at Bay Harbor;

•

the outcome of certain legal proceedings;

•

the impact of lower electricity prices, caused primarily by
    lower natural gas prices, unseasonably cool weather in the
    summer, and decreased industrial production, on the
    profitability of enterprises’ generating units;

•

the impact of representations, warranties, and indemnities
    provided by CMS Energy or its subsidiaries in connection with
    the sales of assets;

•

the impact of changes in commodity prices and interest rates on
    certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge
    accounting and must be marked to market through
    earnings; and

•

the impact of economic conditions in Michigan, including
    population trends and housing activity.

For additional details regarding enterprises’
    uncertainties, see Note 6, Contingencies and Commitments.

Other
    Outlook and Uncertainties

Smart Grid:

Consumers’ development of a smart
    grid is proceeding as planned. The foundation of the smart grid
    program is an advanced metering infrastructure. The program will
    include electric and gas smart meters that are capable of
    transmitting and receiving data, a two-way communications
    network, and modifications to Consumers’ existing systems
    to manage the data. It is intended to enable customers to
    monitor and manage their energy usage and help reduce demand
    during critical peak times, resulting in higher energy
    efficiency and environmental benefits. Due to this system’s
    complexity and relative market immaturity, Consumers is using a
    phased implementation approach that will allow it to analyze,
    test, and pilot the new technology prior to widespread



investment and deployment. Consumers will also make certain
    modifications to its software to enable the new system.
    Consumers intends to begin mass deployment of the system and
    installation of new meters in 2012.

Employee Separation Program:

In November 2009,
    Consumers announced a voluntary separation program for all
    salaried and union employees. Decisions to accept or deny
    employees’ requests for voluntary separation, and
    communication of those decisions to the affected employees,
    occurred in January 2010. A total of 177 salaried employees and
    120 union employees have been approved for early separation.
    Further, in February 2010, Consumers announced the lay-off of an
    additional 76 union employees. Consumers expects to recognize a
    charge of $11 million in 2010 related to the voluntary and
    involuntary components of this program.

Litigation:

CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain of
    their subsidiaries are named as parties in various litigation
    matters, as well as in administrative proceedings before various
    courts and governmental agencies arising in the ordinary course
    of business. For additional details regarding these and other
    legal matters, see Note 6, Contingencies and Commitments
    and Note 7, Utility Rate Matters.

EnerBank:

EnerBank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CMS
    Capital that represents one percent of CMS Energy’s net
    assets, is a state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank
    providing unsecured home improvement loans. The carrying value
    of EnerBank’s loan portfolio was $269 million at
    December 31, 2009. Its loan portfolio was funded primarily
    by deposit liabilities of $214 million and borrowings from
    the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of $40 million.
    Twelve-month rolling average default rates on loans held by
    EnerBank have risen from 1.4 percent at December 31,
    2008 to 2.1 percent at December 31, 2009. Due to the
    economic downturn, EnerBank expects the level of loan defaults
    to remain elevated throughout 2010, returning to lower levels
    thereafter.

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

CONSUMERS ENERGY COMPANY

NOTES
    TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1: SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Corporate Structure:

CMS Energy is an energy company
    operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding
    company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an
    electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a
    domestic IPP. CMS Energy and Consumers manage their businesses
    by the nature of services each provides. CMS Energy operates
    principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas
    utility; and enterprises, its non-utility investments and
    operations. Consumers operates principally in two business
    segments: electric utility and gas utility.

Principles of Consolidation:

CMS Energy and
    Consumers prepare their consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with GAAP. CMS Energy’s consolidated financial
    statements comprise CMS Energy, Consumers, CMS Enterprises, and
    all other entities in which CMS Energy has a controlling
    financial interest or is the primary beneficiary.
    Consumers’ consolidated financial statements comprise
    Consumers and all other entities in which it has a controlling
    financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. CMS Energy
    uses the equity method of accounting for investments in
    companies and partnerships that are not consolidated, where they
    have significant influence over operations and financial
    policies but are not the primary beneficiary. CMS Energy and
    Consumers eliminate intercompany transactions and balances.

Use of Estimates:

CMS Energy and Consumers are
    required to make estimates using assumptions that may affect
    reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

CMS Energy and Consumers record estimated liabilities for
    contingencies in their consolidated financial statements when it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred and when the
    amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. For additional
    details, see Note 6, Contingencies and Commitments.

Revenue Recognition Policy:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    recognize revenue from deliveries of electricity and natural
    gas, and from the transportation, processing, and storage of
    natural gas, when services are provided. CMS Energy and
    Consumers record unbilled revenue for the estimated amount of
    energy delivered to customers but not yet billed. CMS Energy and
    Consumers record sales tax net and exclude it from revenue. CMS
    Energy recognizes revenue on sales of marketed electricity,
    natural gas, and other energy products at delivery.

Alternative-Revenue Program:

Under an electric rate
    order issued by the MPSC in November 2009, Consumers was granted
    authority to implement a revenue decoupling mechanism that
    adjusts customer rates to collect or refund the change in
    marginal revenue arising from the difference between the level
    of average sales per customer adopted in the order and actual
    average sales per customer. Consumers accounts for this program
    as an alternative-revenue program and, accordingly, recognizes
    the effects of decoupling adjustments on revenue as electricity
    is delivered.

Self-Implemented Rates:

Consumers is allowed to
    self-implement new energy rates six months after a new rate case
    filing if the MPSC has not issued an order in the case. The MPSC
    then has another six months to issue a final order. If the MPSC
    does not issue an order, the filed rates are considered
    approved. If the MPSC issues an order, the rates that Consumers
    self-implemented may be subject to refund, with interest.
    Consumers recognizes revenue associated with self-implemented
    rates. If Consumers considers it probable that it will be
    required to refund a portion of its self-implemented rates, then
    Consumers records a provision for revenue subject to refund. For
    details on Consumers’ self-implemented rates, see
    Note 7, Utility Rate Matters.

Accounting for Legal Fees:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    expense legal fees as incurred; fees incurred but not yet billed
    are accrued based on estimates of work performed. This policy
    also applies to any fees incurred on behalf of employees and
    officers under indemnification agreements; such fees are billed
    directly to CMS Energy or Consumers.

Accounting for MISO Transactions:

MISO requires the
    submission of hourly day-ahead and real-time bids and offers for
    energy at locations across the MISO region. Consumers and CMS
    ERM account for MISO



CMS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

transactions on a net hourly basis in each of the real-time and
    day-ahead markets, and they net transactions across all MISO
    energy market locations. CMS Energy and Consumers record net
    purchases in a single hour in Purchased and interchange power
    and net sales in a single hour in Operating Revenue on the
    Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). CMS Energy and
    Consumers record net sale billing adjustments upon invoice
    receipt. CMS Energy and Consumers record expense accruals for
    future net purchases adjustments based on historical experience,
    and reconcile accruals to actual expenses upon invoice receipt.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents
    include short-term, highly liquid investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Determination of Pension and OPEB MRV of Plan
    Assets:

CMS Energy and Consumers determine the MRV for
    pension plan assets as the fair value of plan assets on the
    measurement date, adjusted by the gains or losses that will not
    be admitted into the MRV until future years. CMS Energy and
    Consumers reflect each year’s gain or loss in the MRV in
    equal amounts over a five-year period beginning on the date the
    original amount was determined. CMS Energy and Consumers
    determine the MRV for OPEB plan assets as the fair value of
    assets on the measurement date. CMS Energy and Consumers use the
    MRV in the calculation of net pension and OPEB costs.

Derivative Instruments:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    record derivative contracts that do not qualify for the normal
    purchases and sales exception at fair value on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. If a derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge
    accounting, changes in the fair value are recorded in AOCL;
    otherwise, changes are reported in earnings. For additional
    details regarding derivative instruments, see Note 11,
    Derivative Instruments.

Earnings Per Share:

CMS Energy calculates basic and
    diluted EPS using the weighted-average number of shares of
    common stock and dilutive potential common stock outstanding
    during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of
    determining diluted EPS, includes the effects of dilutive stock
    options, warrants, and convertible securities. CMS Energy
    computes the effect on potential common stock using the treasury
    stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable. Diluted
    EPS excludes the impact of antidilutive securities, which are
    those securities resulting in an increase in EPS or a decrease
    in loss per share. For EPS computations, see Note 9,
    Earnings Per Share — CMS Energy.

Financial Instruments:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    record debt and equity securities classified as available for
    sale at fair value determined primarily from quoted market
    prices. On a specific identification basis, CMS Energy and
    Consumers report unrealized gains and losses from changes in
    fair value of certain

available-for-sale

debt and equity securities, net of tax, in equity as part of
    AOCL. CMS Energy and Consumers exclude unrealized losses from
    earnings unless the related changes in fair value are determined
    to be other than temporary. For additional details regarding
    financial instruments, see Note 10, Financial Instruments.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method
    Investments:

CMS Energy and Consumers perform tests of
    impairment if certain triggering events occur, or if there has
    been a decline in value that may be other than temporary.

CMS Energy and Consumers evaluate long-lived assets held in use
    for impairment by calculating the undiscounted future cash flows
    expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
    disposition. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than
    the carrying amount, CMS Energy and Consumers recognize an
    impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount
    exceeds the fair value. CMS Energy and Consumers estimate the
    fair value of the asset using quoted market prices, market
    prices of similar assets, or discounted future cash flow
    analyses.

CMS Energy also assesses equity method investments for
    impairment whenever there has been a decline in value that is
    other than temporary. This assessment requires CMS Energy to
    determine the fair value of the equity method investment. CMS
    Energy determines fair value using valuation methodologies,
    including discounted cash flows, and assesses the ability of the
    investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the
    carrying amount of the



CMS

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

investment. CMS Energy records an impairment if the fair value
    is less than the carrying amount and the decline in value is
    considered to be other than temporary.

For additional details, see Note 22, Asset Sales,
    Discontinued Operations, and Impairment Charges.

International Operations and Foreign Currency:

CMS
    Energy completed the sale of its international assets in 2007.
    Previously, CMS Energy subsidiaries and affiliates whose
    functional currency was not the U.S. dollar translated
    their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the
    exchange rates in effect at the end of the fiscal period. CMS
    Energy translated revenue and expense accounts of these
    subsidiaries and affiliates into U.S. dollars at the
    average exchange rates that prevailed during the period. CMS
    Energy showed these foreign currency translation adjustments in
    the stockholders’ equity section on its Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. For additional details on the sale of CMS
    Energy’s international assets, see Note 22, Asset
    Sales, Discontinued Operations, and Impairment Charges.

CMS Energy includes exchange rate fluctuations on transactions
    denominated in a currency other than the functional currency,
    except those that are hedged, in determining net income.

Inventory:

CMS Energy and Consumers use the
    weighted-average cost method for valuing working gas,
    recoverable cushion gas in underground storage facilities, and
    materials and supplies inventory. CMS Energy and Consumers also
    use this method for valuing coal inventory, and classify these
    amounts as generating plant fuel stock on their Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

CMS Energy and Consumers classify renewable energy credits and
    emission allowances as materials and supplies inventory and use
    the average cost method to remove amounts from inventory as the
    renewable energy credits and emission allowances are used to
    generate power.

CMS Energy and Consumers use the lower of cost or market method
    to evaluate inventory for impairment.

Maintenance and Depreciation:

CMS Energy and
    Consumers record property repairs and minor property replacement
    as maintenance expense. CMS Energy and Consumers record planned
    major maintenance activities as operating expense unless the
    cost represents the acquisition of additional components or the
    replacement of an existing component.

Consumers depreciates utility property using a composite method,
    in which it applies a single MPSC-approved depreciation rate to
    the gross investment in a particular class of property within
    the electric and gas segments. Consumers performs depreciation
    studies periodically to determine appropriate group lives. The
    composite depreciation rates for Consumers’ properties are
    as follows:

Property, Plant, and Equipment:

CMS Energy and
    Consumers record property, plant, and equipment at original cost
    when placed into service. The cost includes labor, material,
    applicable taxes, pension, other benefits, and AFUDC, if
    applicable. Consumers’ property, plant, and equipment is
    recoverable through its general rate making process. For
    additional details see Note 7, Utility Rate Matters.

When utility property is retired or otherwise disposed of in the
    ordinary course of business, Consumers records the original cost
    to accumulated depreciation, along with associated cost of
    removal, net of salvage. CMS Energy and Consumers recognize
    gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of non-regulated
    assets in income. Cost of removal collected from customers, but
    not spent, is recorded as a regulatory liability.

Consumers capitalizes AFUDC on regulated major construction
    projects, except pollution control facilities on its
    fossil-fueled power plants and where financing costs are
    specifically approved by the MPSC in rates. AFUDC

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

represents the estimated cost of debt and authorized return on
    equity funds used to finance construction additions. Consumers
    records the offsetting credit as a reduction of interest for the
    amount representing the borrowed funds component and as other
    income for the equity funds component on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. When construction is completed and the
    property is placed in service, Consumers depreciates and
    recovers the capitalized AFUDC from customers over the life of
    the related asset. The following table shows Consumers’
    electric, gas and common composite AFUDC capitalization rates:

Years Ended December 31

CMS Energy and Consumers capitalize the purchase and development
    of internal-use computer software. These costs are expensed
    evenly over the estimated useful life of the internal-use
    computer software. If computer software is integral to computer
    hardware, then its cost is capitalized and depreciated with the
    hardware.

The types of costs capitalized are consistent for all periods
    presented by the financial statements. For additional details on
    property, plant, and equipment see Note 16, Property,
    Plant, and Equipment.

Property Taxes:

Property taxes are based on the
    taxable value of Consumers’ real and personal property
    assessed by local taxing authorities. Consumers records property
    tax expense over the fiscal year of the taxing authority for
    which the taxes are levied based on Consumers’ budgeted
    customer sales. The deferred property tax balance represents the
    amount of Consumers’ accrued property tax that will be
    recognized over future governmental fiscal periods.

Reclassifications:

CMS Energy and Consumers have
    reclassified certain prior-period amounts on their Consolidated
    Financial Statements to conform to the presentation for the
    current period. These reclassifications did not affect
    consolidated net income (loss) or cash flows for the periods
    presented.

Restricted Cash:

CMS Energy and Consumers classify
    restricted cash dedicated for repayment of Securitization bonds
    as a current asset, as the related payments occur within one
    year.

Trade Receivables and Notes Receivable:

Accounts
    receivable comprise trade receivables and unbilled receivables.
    CMS Energy and Consumers record their accounts receivable at
    cost, which approximates fair value. CMS Energy and Consumers
    establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts and loan
    losses based on historical losses, management’s assessment
    of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other
    factors. CMS Energy and Consumers assess late payment fees on
    trade receivables based on contractual past-due terms
    established with customers. CMS Energy and Consumers charge off
    accounts deemed uncollectible to operating expense.

Non-current notes receivable consisted of EnerBank’s
    consumer loans totaling $269 million, net of an allowance
    for loan losses of $6 million at December 31, 2009,
    and $186 million, net of an allowance for loan losses of
    $4 million at December 31, 2008. EnerBank provides
    unsecured, fixed-rate installment loans to homeowners to finance
    home improvements.

Unamortized Debt Premium, Discount, and Expense:

CMS
    Energy and Consumers defer premiums, discounts, and issuance
    costs of long-term debt and amortize those costs over the terms
    of the debt issues. For the non-regulated portions of CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses, refinancing costs
    are expensed as incurred. For the regulated portions of CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses, any remaining
    unamortized premiums, discounts, and issuance costs associated
    with refinanced debt are amortized over the term of the newly
    issued debt.

    nongovernmental GAAP, except for SEC rules and interpretive
    releases, which are also authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.
    The ASC supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting
    standards. CMS Energy and Consumers have included references to

    instead use alternative valuation techniques, such as
    discounting future cash flows assuming an orderly transaction.
    This standard also requires quarterly disclosures about the
    inputs and valuation techniques used in fair value measurements.
    Previously, only annual disclosures about valuation techniques
    were required. See Note 5, Fair Value Measurements, for the

This
    standard, which was effective for CMS Energy and Consumers
    April 1, 2009, amends the guidance for determining whether
    an

other-than-temporary

impairment has occurred for debt securities. Entities no longer
    need to assert both the intent and ability to hold an impaired
    debt security until recovery to avoid recording an

other-than-temporary

impairment. Instead, an entity must consider whether it intends
    to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that
    it will be required to sell the security prior to recovery. If
    either of these criteria are met, the full impairment should be
    recognized in earnings. If neither criterion is met, only
    impairments due to credit losses should be recorded in earnings,
    while impairments related to other factors should be recorded in
    other comprehensive income. This standard also includes
    additional disclosure requirements. This standard had no impact
    on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ Consolidated Financial

Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Accounting for Transfers of

This standard, which was effective for CMS

    of a QSPE from guidance relating to transfers of financial
    assets and extinguishments of liabilities. It also removes the
    exceptions from applying guidance relating to VIEs to QSPEs.
    This standard revises and clarifies when an entity is required
    to derecognize a financial asset that it has transferred to
    another entity. It further clarifies how to measure beneficial
    interests received as proceeds in connection with a transfer of
    a financial asset, and introduces the concept of a
    “participating interest,” the conditions of which must
    be met for a partial asset transfer to qualify for sale
    accounting treatment. This standard also requires enhanced
    disclosures related to continuing involvement with transferred
    financial assets. Under this standard, future transactions
    entered into under Consumers’ revolving accounts receivable
    sales program, discussed in Note 8, Financings and
    Capitalization, would be accounted for as secured borrowings
    rather than as sales. CMS Energy and Consumers would present

    interest in a VIE. It replaces the quantitative calculation of
    risks and rewards with a qualitative approach focused on
    identifying which enterprise (1) has the power to direct
    the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the
    entity’s economic performance and (2) has the
    obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to
    receive benefits from the entity. This standard also requires
    ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary
    beneficiary of a VIE. CMS Energy and Consumers are evaluating
    the impact of this standard on their Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements:

This
    standard expands the required quarterly disclosures about fair
    value measurements that are included in Note 5, Fair Value
    Measurements. This standard requires information on transfers in
    and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In
    addition, this standard requires gross reporting of purchases,
    sales, issuances, and settlements in the reconciliation of
    Level 3 fair values, rather than reporting this activity as
    one net amount. This standard also clarifies certain existing
    disclosure requirements. This standard was effective for CMS
    Energy and Consumers January 1, 2010, except for the gross
    reporting of Level 3 fair value activity, which will be
    effective January 1, 2011. This standard will not impact
    CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ consolidated income, cash
    flows, or financial position.

5: FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Accounting standards define fair value as the price that would
    be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
    an orderly transaction between market participants. When
    measuring fair value, CMS Energy and Consumers are required to
    incorporate all assumptions that market participants would use
    in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about
    risk. A fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs used to measure
    fair value according to their observability in the market. The
    three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

•

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 inputs are observable, market-based inputs, other
    than Level 1 prices. Level 2 inputs may include quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
    quoted prices in inactive markets, interest rates and yield
    curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, credit risks,
    default rates, and inputs derived from or corroborated by
    observable market data.

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect CMS
    Energy’s or Consumers’ own assumptions about how
    market participants would value their assets and liabilities.

To the extent possible, CMS Energy and Consumers use quoted
    market prices or other observable market pricing data in valuing
    assets and liabilities measured at fair value. If this
    information is unavailable, they use market-corroborated data or
    reasonable estimates about market participant assumptions. CMS
    Energy and Consumers classify fair value measurements within the
    fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is
    significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents and restricted
    cash equivalents consist of money market funds with daily
    liquidity. The funds invest in U.S. Treasury notes, other
    government-backed securities, and repurchase agreements
    collateralized by U.S. Treasury notes.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Assets:

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ nonqualified deferred
    compensation plan assets are invested in various mutual funds.
    CMS Energy and Consumers value these assets using a market
    approach, using the daily quoted NAV provided by the fund
    managers that are the basis for transactions to buy or sell
    shares in each fund. CMS Energy and Consumers report these
    assets in Other non-current assets on their Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

SERP Assets:

CMS Energy and Consumers value their
    SERP assets using a market approach, incorporating prices and
    other relevant information from market transactions.

The SERP cash equivalents consist of a money market fund with
    daily liquidity, which invests in state and municipal
    securities. At December 31, 2008, the SERP held an
    investment in an S&P 500 Index mutual fund. The fund’s
    equity securities were listed on an active exchange. The fair
    value of the SERP mutual fund was based on the quoted NAV of the
    mutual fund, derived from the daily closing prices of the equity
    securities held by the fund. The NAV was the basis for
    transactions to buy or sell shares in the fund. In November
    2009, CMS Energy and Consumers sold their interests in the fund
    and invested the sales proceeds in the money market fund.

CMS Energy and Consumers value their SERP state and municipal
    bonds using a matrix pricing model that incorporates
    Level 2 market-based information. The fair value of the
    bonds is derived from various observable inputs, including
    benchmark yields, reported securities trades, broker/dealer
    quotes, bond ratings, and general information on market
    movements for investment grade state and municipal securities
    normally considered by market participants when pricing such
    debt securities. CMS Energy and Consumers report their SERP
    assets in Other non-current assets on their Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. For additional details about SERP securities, see
    Note 10, Financial Instruments.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
    Liabilities:

CMS Energy and Consumers value their
    non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities based on
    the fair values of the plan assets, as they reflect what CMS
    Energy and Consumers owe the plan participants in accordance
    with their investment elections. CMS Energy reports these
    liabilities, except for liabilities related to its DSSP, in
    Other non-current liabilities on its Consolidated Balance
    Sheets; its DSSP liability is included in Non-current
    postretirement benefits. Consumers reports all of its
    nonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities in Other
    non-current liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Derivative Instruments:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    value their derivative instruments using either a market
    approach that incorporates information from market transactions,
    or an income approach that discounts future expected cash flows
    to a present value amount. They use various inputs to value the
    derivatives depending on the type of contract and the
    availability of market data. CMS Energy has exchange-traded
    derivative contracts that are valued based on Level 1
    quoted prices in actively traded markets, as well as derivatives
    that are valued using Level 2 inputs, including commodity
    market prices, interest rates, credit ratings, default rates,
    and market-based seasonality factors. CMS Energy also has
    derivative instruments that extend beyond time periods in which
    quoted prices are available. For these instruments, CMS Energy
    uses modeling methods to project future prices. Such fair value
    measurements are classified in Level 3 unless modeling was
    required only for an insignificant portion of the total
    derivative value.

CMS Energy’s derivatives include an electricity sales
    agreement held by CMS ERM. This agreement, classified as
    Level 3, extends beyond the term for which quoted
    electricity prices are available. To value this agreement, CMS
    Energy uses a proprietary forward power pricing curve that is
    based on forward gas prices and an implied heat rate. CMS Energy
    also increases the fair value of the liability for this
    agreement by an amount that reflects the uncertainty of its
    model.



CMS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

For all fair values other than Level 1 prices, CMS Energy
    and Consumers incorporate adjustments for the risk of
    nonperformance. For derivative assets, a credit adjustment is
    applied against the asset based on the published default rate
    for the credit rating that CMS Energy and Consumers assign to
    the counterparty based on an internal credit-scoring model. This
    model considers various inputs, including the
    counterparty’s financial statements, credit reports, trade
    press, and other information that would be available to market
    participants. To the extent that the internal ratings are
    comparable to credit ratings published by independent rating
    agencies, the resulting credit adjustment is classified within
    Level 2. If the internal model results in a rating that is
    outside of the range of ratings given by the independent
    agencies and the credit adjustment is significant to the overall
    valuation, the derivative fair value is classified as
    Level 3. CMS Energy and Consumers adjust their derivative
    liabilities downward to reflect the risk of their own
    nonperformance, based on their published credit ratings.
    Adjustments for credit risk using the approach outlined within
    this paragraph are not materially different from the adjustments
    that would result from using credit default swap rates for the
    contracts presently held. For further details about derivative
    contracts, see Note 11, Derivative Instruments.

Gas Index Price Reporting Investigation:

In 2002,
    CMS Energy notified appropriate regulatory and governmental
    agencies that some employees at CMS MST and CMS Field Services
    appeared to have provided inaccurate information regarding
    natural gas trades to various energy industry publications,
    which compile and report index prices. CMS Energy cooperated
    with an investigation by the DOJ regarding this matter. Although
    CMS Energy has not received any formal notification that the DOJ
    has completed its investigation, the DOJ’s last request for
    information occurred in 2003, and CMS Energy completed its
    response to this request in 2004. CMS Energy is unable to
    predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation and what effect, if
    any, the investigation will have on CMS Energy.

Gas Index Price Reporting Litigation:

CMS Energy,
    along with CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas,
    Inc., and Cantera Gas Company, are named as defendants in
    various class action and individual lawsuits arising as a result
    of alleged inaccurate natural gas price reporting to
    publications that report trade information. Allegations include
    manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures and options prices,
    price-fixing

conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial inflation of
    natural gas retail prices in California, Colorado, Kansas,
    Missouri, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. The following provides more
    detail on these proceedings:

•

In 2005, CMS MST was served with a summons and complaint that
    named CMS Energy, CMS MST, and CMS Field Services as defendants
    in a putative class action filed in Kansas state court, Learjet,
    Inc., et al. v. Oneok, Inc., et al. The complaint alleges
    that during the putative class period, January 1, 2000
    through October 31, 2002, the defendants engaged in a
    scheme to violate the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The
    plaintiffs, who allege they purchased natural gas from the
    defendants and others for their facilities, are seeking
    statutory full consideration damages consisting of the full
    consideration paid by plaintiffs for natural gas.

•

In 2007, a class action complaint, Heartland Regional Medical
    Center, et al. v. Oneok, Inc. et al., was filed in Missouri
    state court alleging violations of Missouri antitrust laws.
    Defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS Field Services, and CMS
    MST, are alleged to have violated the Missouri antitrust law in
    connection with their natural gas price reporting activities.

•

A class action complaint, Arandell Corp., et al. v. XCEL
    Energy Inc., et al., was filed in 2006 in Wisconsin state court
    on behalf of Wisconsin commercial entities that purchased
    natural gas between January 1, 2000 and October 31,
    2002. The defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS ERM, and Cantera
    Gas Company, are alleged to have violated Wisconsin’s
    antitrust statute. The plaintiffs are seeking full consideration
    damages, plus exemplary damages, and attorneys’ fees. After
    dismissal on jurisdictional grounds in February 2009, plaintiffs
    filed a new Arandell case in Michigan. The CMS Energy defendants
    filed a motion to dismiss the new case on

statute-of-limitations

grounds and that motion remains pending. Also pending before the
    court is plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration of the
    dismissal of the Wisconsin case.

•

Another class action complaint, Newpage Wisconsin System v.
    CMS ERM, CMS Energy, and Cantera Gas Company, was filed in March
    2009 in circuit court in Wood County, Wisconsin, against CMS
    Energy defendants and 19 other non-CMS Energy companies. The
    plaintiff is seeking consideration damages, treble damages,
    costs, interest, and attorneys’ fees. After removal to
    federal court in Wisconsin, the case was transferred to the MDL
    case. CMS Energy defendants have filed motions to dismiss for
    lack of jurisdiction and based on the statute of limitations and
    that motion remains pending.

•

In 2005, J.P. Morgan Trust Company, in its capacity as
    Trustee of the FLI Liquidating Trust, filed an action in Kansas
    state court against a number of energy companies, including CMS
    Energy, CMS MST, and CMS Field Services. The complaint alleges
    various claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The
    plaintiff is seeking statutory full consideration damages for
    its purchases of natural gas between January 1, 2000 and
    December 31, 2001. This case is part of the MDL proceeding,
    but is not a class action.

After removal to federal court, the Learjet, Heartland, both
    Arandell cases, Newpage, and J.P. Morgan cases were
    transferred to the MDL case. CMS Energy was dismissed from the
    Learjet, Heartland, and J.P. Morgan cases in February 2009,
    but other CMS Energy defendants remain parties. Pending before
    the court in all of the MDL cases are the defendants’
    renewed motions for summary judgment based on FERC preemption
    and the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend their
    complaint to add a federal Sherman Act antitrust claim. In all
    but the J.P. Morgan case, there are also pending
    plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. These motions
    are not yet decided.

•

In 2005, Samuel D. Leggett, et al. v. Duke Energy Corporation,
    et al., a class action complaint brought on behalf of retail and
    business purchasers of natural gas in Tennessee, was filed in
    the Chancery Court of Fayette County, Tennessee. The defendants
    include CMS Energy, CMS MST, and CMS Field Services. The
    complaint contains claims for violations of the Tennessee Trade
    Practices Act. The complaint seeks statutory full consideration
    damages and attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief
    regulating defendants’ future conduct. In 2007, the state
    court in Tennessee granted the motion to dismiss filed by the
    CMS Energy defendants. In 2008, the Tennessee Court of Appeals
    reversed the trial court and remanded the case for trial. The
    Tennessee

Supreme Court granted the defendants’ application for leave
    to appeal and all further proceedings in the trial court have
    been stayed until that appeal is resolved. Oral argument on the
    appeal took place in Tennessee Supreme Court in November 2009.
    This issue is not yet decided.

•

In 2006, CMS Energy and CMS MST were each served with a summons
    and complaint which named CMS Energy, CMS MST, and CMS Field
    Services as defendants in an action filed in Missouri state
    court, titled Missouri Public Service Commission v. Oneok,
    Inc. alleging violation of the Missouri antitrust law, fraud,
    and unjust enrichment. In January 2009, all defendants were
    dismissed for lack of standing. In December 2009, the Missouri
    Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal.

These cases involve complex facts, a large number of similarly
    situated defendants with different factual positions, and
    multiple jurisdictions. Presently, any estimate of liability
    would be highly speculative; the amount of CMS Energy’s
    possible loss would be based on widely varying models previously
    untested in this context. Defenses are being pursued vigorously,
    which could result in the dismissal of the cases completely, but
    CMS Energy is unable to predict the outcome of these matters. If
    the outcome is unfavorable, these cases could have a material
    adverse impact on CMS Energy’s financial condition and
    results of operations.

Bay Harbor:

As part of the development of Bay Harbor
    by certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy, and under an agreement
    with the MDNRE, third parties constructed a golf course and park
    over several abandoned CKD piles left over from the former
    cement plant operations on the Bay Harbor site. The third
    parties also undertook a series of remedial actions, including
    constructing a leachate collection system at an identified seep.
    Leachate is produced when water enters into the CKD piles. In
    2002, CMS Energy sold its interest in Bay Harbor, but retained
    its obligations under environmental indemnities entered into at
    the start of the project.

In 2005, the EPA, along with CMS Land and CMS Capital,
    voluntarily executed an AOC under Superfund and approved a
    Removal Action Work Plan to address contamination issues at Bay
    Harbor. Collection systems required under the plan have been
    installed and effectiveness monitoring of the systems at the
    shoreline is ongoing. CMS Land, CMS Capital, and the EPA agreed
    upon augmentation measures to address areas where pH
    measurements were not satisfactory. The augmentation measures
    were implemented and completed in the second quarter of 2009.

In 2008, the MDNRE and the EPA granted permits for CMS Land or
    its affiliate, Beeland, to construct and operate a deep
    injection well in Antrim County, Michigan, to dispose of
    leachate from Bay Harbor. Certain environmental groups, a local
    township, and a local county filed lawsuits appealing the
    permits. The legal proceeding was stayed in the third quarter of
    2009 and can be renewed by either party at any time. CMS Land
    and CMS Capital continue to seek a lower cost long-term water
    disposal option including using deep injection wells, permitted
    discharge to surface water, and disposal with a local municipal
    water treatment facility.

CMS Land and CMS Capital, the MDNRE, the EPA, and other parties
    are negotiating the long-term remedy for the Bay Harbor sites,
    including:

•

the disposal of leachate;

•

the capping and excavation of CKD;

•

the location and design of collection lines and upstream
    diversion of water;

•

potential flow of leachate below the collection system;

•

applicable criteria for various substances such as
    mercury; and

•

other matters that are likely to affect the scope of remedial
    work that CMS Land and CMS Capital may be obligated to undertake.

CMS Energy has recorded a cumulative charge related to Bay
    Harbor of $179 million, of which $37 million was
    recorded in 2009, $1 million was recorded in 2008, and
    $45 million was recorded in 2007 in Other operating

expenses on its Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).
    Several factors contributed to the revised remediation cost
    estimates in 2009, including increased costs related to the
    disposal of collected leachate and delays in identifying and
    securing a long-term water management solution. In addition, CMS
    Land and CMS Capital are projecting higher costs for operating
    and maintaining the existing collection system.

At December 31, 2009, CMS Energy had a recorded liability
    of $78 million for its remaining obligations. CMS Energy
    calculated this liability based on discounted projected costs,
    using a discount rate of 4.32 percent and an inflation rate
    of one percent on annual operating and maintenance costs. CMS
    Energy based the discount rate on the interest rate for

30-year

U.S. Treasury securities on June 30, 2009. The
    undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is
    $101 million. CMS Energy expects to pay $18 million in
    2010, $9 million in 2011, $7 million in 2012,
    $5 million in 2013, and the remainder on long-term liquid
    disposal and operating and maintenance costs.

CMS Energy’s estimate of remedial action costs and the
    timing of expenditures could change if there are additional
    major changes in circumstances or assumptions, including but not
    limited to:

•

inability to secure a suitable long-term water disposal option
    at a reasonable cost;

•

further increases in water disposal costs under existing options;

•

delays in developing a long-term water disposal option;

•

an increase in the number of contamination areas;

•

different remediation techniques;

•

the nature and extent of contamination;

•

continued inability to reach agreement with the MDNRE or the EPA
    over required remedial actions;

•

delays in the receipt of requested permits;

•

delays following the receipt of any requested permits due to
    legal appeals of third parties;

•

additional or new legal or regulatory requirements; or

•

new or different landowner claims.

Depending on the size of any indemnity obligation or liability
    under environmental laws, an adverse outcome of this matter
    could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s
    liquidity and financial condition and could negatively affect
    CMS Energy’s financial results. CMS Energy cannot predict
    the financial impact or outcome of this matter.

State Street Bank and TSU Litigation:

In 2002, State
    Street Bank sued CMS Viron in the District Court of Harris
    County, Texas, claiming primarily a breach of representations
    and warranties and seeking $9 million plus interest from
    CMS Viron. During the same year, CMS Viron filed a counterclaim,
    as well as third-party actions against TSU, Academic Capital
    Group, Inc., and Academic Services, Inc. for breach of contract
    and fiduciary duties and conversion. In December 2009, the jury
    rendered a verdict in favor of CMS Viron and a final judgment
    was rendered on January 15, 2010 awarding CMS Viron
    $8 million plus prejudgment interest from TSU and another
    $3 million plus prejudgment interest and attorneys’
    fees against Academic Capital Group, Inc. and Academic Services,
    Inc., collectively. This verdict is affected by an agreement
    under which CMS Viron agreed to pay $3 million to State
    Street Bank regardless of the verdict. In addition, State Street
    Bank agreed to assign certain rights of indemnification under a
    lease agreement to CMS Viron in return for a two-thirds stake in
    any ultimate recovery from TSU. At December 31, 2009, CMS
    Energy had a recorded liability of $3 million for its
    potential obligation related to this matter.

Equatorial Guinea Tax Claim:

In 2004, CMS Energy
    received a request for indemnification from the purchaser of CMS
    Oil and Gas. The indemnity claim relates to the sale of CMS
    Energy’s oil, gas, and methanol projects in Equatorial
    Guinea and the claim of the government of Equatorial Guinea that
    CMS Energy owes $142 million in taxes in connection with
    that sale. CMS Energy concluded that the government’s tax
    claim is without merit and the purchaser of CMS Oil and Gas
    submitted a response to the government rejecting the claim. The
    government of Equatorial Guinea has indicated that it still
    intends to pursue its claim. CMS Energy cannot predict the
    financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Moroccan Tax Claim:

In 2007, CMS Energy sold its
    50 percent interest in Jorf Lasfar. As part of the sale
    agreement, CMS Energy agreed to indemnify the purchaser for
    50 percent of any tax assessments on Jorf Lasfar
    attributable to tax years prior to the sale. In 2007, the
    Moroccan tax authority concluded its audit of Jorf Lasfar for
    tax years 2003 through 2005. The audit asserted deficiencies in
    certain corporate and withholding taxes. In January 2009, CMS
    Energy paid $18 million, which it charged against a tax
    indemnification liability established when it recorded the sale
    of Jorf Lasfar, and accordingly, the payment did not affect
    earnings. The Moroccan tax authority may also assess taxes for
    2006. CMS Energy cannot predict the outcome of this matter. At
    December 31, 2009, CMS Energy had a recorded liability of
    $4 million for its potential indemnity obligation for
    corporate and withholding taxes for 2006.

Marathon Indemnity Claim regarding F.T. Barr Claim:

In
    2001, F. T. Barr filed a lawsuit in Harris County District Court
    in Texas against CMS Energy, CMS Oil and Gas, and other
    defendants alleging that his overriding royalty payments related
    to Alba field production were improperly calculated. In 2004,
    all parties signed a confidential settlement agreement that
    resolved claims between Barr and the defendants. The CMS Energy
    defendants reserved all defenses to any indemnity claim relating
    to the settlement.

In April 2009, certain Marathon entities filed a case in the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas
    against CMS Enterprises for indemnification in connection with
    this matter. CMS Energy entities dispute Marathon’s claim,
    and will vigorously oppose it. CMS Energy entities also will
    assert that Marathon has suffered minimal, if any, damages. CMS
    Energy cannot predict the outcome of this matter. If
    Marathon’s claim were sustained, it would have a material
    effect on CMS Energy’s future earnings and cash flow.

Consumers’
    Electric Utility Contingencies

Electric Environmental Matters:

Consumers’
    operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations.
    Generally, Consumers has been able to recover, in customer
    rates, the costs to operate its facilities in compliance with
    these laws and regulations.

Cleanup and Solid Waste:

Under NREPA, Consumers will
    ultimately incur remediation and other response activity costs
    at a number of sites. Consumers believes that these costs should
    be recoverable in rates under current ratemaking policies, but
    cannot guarantee that outcome. At December 31, 2009,
    Consumers had a recorded liability of $1 million, its
    estimated probable NREPA liability, in accordance with
    applicable accounting standards.

Consumers is a potentially responsible party at a number of
    contaminated sites administered under the Superfund. Superfund
    liability is joint and several. In addition to Consumers, many
    other creditworthy parties with substantial assets are
    potentially responsible with respect to the individual sites.
    Based on its experience, Consumers estimates that its share of
    the total liability for known Superfund sites will be between
    $2 million and $8 million. Various factors, including
    the number of potentially responsible parties involved with each
    site, affect Consumers’ share of the total liability. At
    December 31, 2009, Consumers had a recorded liability of
    $2 million, the minimum amount in the range of its
    estimated probable Superfund liability.

The timing of payments related to Consumers’ remediation
    and other response activities at its Superfund and NREPA sites
    is uncertain. Periodically, Consumers receives information about
    new sites, which leads it to review its cost estimates. Any
    significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an
    increase in the number of sites,



CMS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

different remediation techniques, nature and extent of
    contamination, and legal and regulatory requirements, could
    affect its estimates of NREPA and Superfund liability.

Ludington PCB:

In 1998, during routine maintenance
    activities, Consumers identified PCB as a component in certain
    paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington. Consumers
    removed and replaced part of the PCB material with non-PCB
    material. Since proposing a plan to take action with respect to
    the remaining materials, Consumers has had several
    communications with the EPA. Consumers is not able to predict
    when the EPA will issue a final ruling and cannot predict the
    financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Electric Utility Plant Air Permit Issues and Notices of
    Violation:

In 2007, Consumers received a NOV/FOV from the
    EPA alleging that fourteen utility boilers exceeded the visible
    emission limits in their associated air permits. Consumers has
    responded formally to the NOV/FOV denying the allegations. In
    addition, the EPA has alleged that some utilities have
    classified incorrectly major plant modifications as RMRR rather
    than seeking permits from the EPA or state regulatory agencies
    to modify their plants. Consumers responded to information
    requests from the EPA on this subject in the past. Consumers
    believes that it has properly interpreted the requirements of
    RMRR. In 2008, Consumers received a NOV for three of its
    coal-fueled facilities alleging, among other things, violations
    of NSR and PSD regulations relating to ten projects from 1986 to
    1998 allegedly subject to NSR review.

Consumers is engaged in discussions with the EPA on all of these
    matters. Depending upon the outcome of these discussions, the
    EPA could bring legal action against Consumers

and/or

Consumers could be required to install additional pollution
    control equipment at some or all of its coal-fueled electric
    generating plants, surrender emission allowances, engage in
    Supplemental Environmental Programs,

and/or

pay
    fines. Additionally, Consumers would need to assess the
    viability of continuing operations at certain plants. Consumers
    cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of these matters.
    Although the potential costs relating to these matters could be
    material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects
    that it would be able to recover such costs in rates, consistent
    with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with
    environmental laws and regulations.

Nuclear
    Matters:

DOE Litigation:

In 1997, a United States Court of
    Appeals decision confirmed that the DOE was to begin accepting
    deliveries of spent nuclear fuel for disposal by January 1998.
    Subsequent United States Court of Appeals litigation, in which
    Consumers and other utilities participated, has not been
    successful in producing more specific relief for the DOE’s
    failure to accept the spent nuclear fuel.

A number of court decisions support the right of utilities to
    pursue damage claims in the United States Court of Claims
    against the DOE for failure to take delivery of spent nuclear
    fuel. Consumers filed a complaint in 2002. If Consumers’
    litigation against the DOE is successful, Consumers plans to use
    any recoveries as reimbursement for the incurred costs of spent
    nuclear fuel storage during Consumers’ ownership of
    Palisades and Big Rock. Consumers cannot predict the financial
    impact or outcome of this matter. The sale of Palisades and the
    Big Rock ISFSI did not transfer the right to any recoveries from
    the DOE related to costs of spent nuclear fuel storage incurred
    during Consumers’ ownership of Palisades and Big Rock.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Cost:

Consumers has a recorded
    liability of $163 million for amounts it collected from
    customers before 1983 to fund the disposal of spent nuclear
    fuel. This amount, which includes interest of $119 million,
    is payable to the DOE when it begins to accept delivery of spent
    nuclear fuel. In conjunction with the sale of Palisades and the
    Big Rock ISFSI in 2007, Consumers retained this obligation and
    provided a letter of credit to Entergy as security for this
    obligation.

Consumers’
    Gas Utility Contingencies

Gas Environmental Matters:

Consumers expects to
    incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number
    of sites under the NREPA. These sites include 23 former MGP
    facilities. Consumers operated the facilities on these sites for
    some part of their operating lives. For some of these sites,
    Consumers has no current ownership or may own only a portion of
    the original site. At December 31, 2009, Consumers
    estimated its undiscounted remaining remediation and other
    response activity costs to be between $35 million and
    $49 million. Generally, Consumers has been able to recover
    most of its costs to date through proceeds from insurance
    settlements and customer rates.

At December 31, 2009, Consumers had a recorded liability of
    $35 million and a regulatory asset of $63 million that
    included $28 million of deferred MGP expenditures. The
    timing of payments related to the remediation and other response
    activity at Consumers’ former MGP sites is uncertain.
    Consumers expects its remediation and other response activity
    costs to average $6 million annually over the next five
    years. Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. Any
    significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an
    increase in the number of sites, changes in remediation
    techniques, or legal and regulatory requirements, could affect
    Consumers’ estimates of annual response activity costs and
    MGP liability.

FERC Investigation:

In 2008, Consumers received a
    data request relating to an investigation the FERC is conducting
    into possible violations of the FERC’s posting and
    competitive bidding regulations related to releases of firm
    capacity on natural gas pipelines. Consumers responded to the
    FERC’s first data request in the first quarter of 2008. The
    FERC has also taken depositions and Consumers has responded to
    additional data requests. In August 2009, Consumers received a
    letter presenting the preliminary view of the FERC staff that
    Consumers violated a regulation in connection with certain
    capacity release transactions from August 2005 through October
    2007. Consumers submitted a response and defense of its views to
    the FERC in September 2009. In February 2010, the FERC Office of
    Enforcement informed Consumers that it was closing the
    investigation without any sanctions.

(a)

The majority of this amount arises from stock and asset sales
    agreements under which CMS Energy indemnified the purchaser for
    losses resulting from various matters, including claims related
    to tax disputes, claims related to PPAs, and defects in title to
    the assets or stock sold to the purchaser by CMS Energy
    subsidiaries. Except for items described elsewhere in this Note,
    CMS Energy believes the likelihood of loss to be remote for the
    indemnity obligations not recorded as liabilities.

(b)

In the normal course of business, CMS Energy issues surety bonds
    and indemnifications to counterparties to facilitate commercial
    transactions. CMS Energy would be required to pay a counterparty
    if the counterparty incurred losses due to a breach of contract
    terms or nonperformance under the contract.

At December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of CMS
    Energy’s put option agreements with certain Bay Harbor
    property owners was $1 million. If CMS Energy is required
    to purchase a Bay Harbor property under a put option agreement,
    it may sell the property to recover the amount paid under the
    put option agreement.

At December 31, 2009, the maximum obligation and carrying
    amounts for Consumers’ guarantees were immaterial.

CMS Energy and Consumers also enter into various agreements
    containing tax and other indemnity provisions for which they are
    unable to estimate the maximum potential obligation. These
    factors include unspecified exposure under certain agreements.
    CMS Energy and Consumers consider the likelihood that they would
    be required to perform or incur substantial losses related to
    these indemnities to be remote.

Other
    Contingencies

In addition to the matters disclosed in this Note and
    Note 7, Utility Rate Matters, there are certain lawsuits
    and administrative proceedings before various courts and
    governmental agencies arising from the ordinary course of
    business to which CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain other
    subsidiaries of CMS Energy are parties. These lawsuits and
    proceedings may involve personal injury, property damage,
    contracts, environmental issues, federal and state taxes, rates,
    licensing, and other matters. Further, CMS Energy and Consumers
    occasionally self-report certain regulatory non-compliance
    matters that may or may not eventually result in administrative
    proceedings. CMS Energy and Consumers believe that the outcome
    of any one of these proceedings will not have a material adverse
    effect on their consolidated results of operations, financial
    position, or cash flows.

Purchase obligations are long-term contracts for the purchase of
    commodities and services. These obligations include operating
    contracts used to ensure adequate supply with generating
    facilities that meet PURPA requirements. The commodities and
    services include natural gas and associated transportation,
    electricity, and coal and associated transportation.

The MCV PPA:

Consumers has a

35-year

PPA
    that began in 1990 with the MCV Partnership to purchase
    1,240 MW of electricity. The MCV PPA provides for:

•

a capacity charge of $10.14 per MWh of available capacity;

•

a fixed energy charge based on Consumers’ annual average
    base load coal generating plant operating and maintenance cost;

•

a variable energy charge for all delivered energy that reflects
    the MCV Partnership’s cost of production;

•

a $5 million annual contribution by the MCV Partnership to
    a renewable resources program; and

•

an option for Consumers to extend the MCV PPA for five years or
    purchase the MCV Facility at the conclusion of the MCV
    PPA’s term in March 2025.

Capacity and energy charges, net of RCP replacement energy and
    benefits, under the MCV PPA were $246 million in 2009,
    $320 million in 2008, and $464 million in 2007. Based
    on a 2008 contract amendment and approval by the MPSC that
    allows Consumers to manage the contract more cost effectively,
    Consumers estimates that capacity and energy charges under the
    MCV PPA will range from $240 million to $330 million
    annually.

The Palisades PPA:

Consumers has a PPA expiring in
    2022 with Entergy to purchase all of the capacity and energy
    produced by Palisades, up to the annual average capacity of
    798 MW. Consumers estimates that capacity and energy
    payments under the Palisades PPA will average $320 million
    annually. Consumers’ total purchases of capacity and energy
    under the PPA were $276 million in 2009, $298 million
    in 2008, and $180 million in 2007. For further details
    about Palisades, see Note 15, Leases.

    RATE MATTERS

Consumers’
    Electric Utility Rate Matters

Power Supply Cost Recovery:

The PSCR process is
    designed to allow Consumers to recover all of its power supply
    costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and
    practices. The MPSC reviews these costs,



CMS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

policies, and practices in annual plan and reconciliation
    proceedings. Consumers adjusts its PSCR billing factor monthly
    in order to minimize the over- or underrecovery amount in the
    annual PSCR reconciliation.

The following table summarizes the PSCR reconciliation filings
    pending with the MPSC:

In the 2007 PSCR Plan, Consumers expected to offset power supply
    costs by including a $44 million credit for proceeds due to
    customers from the Palisades sale; however, the MPSC directed
    that those proceeds be refunded outside of the PSCR process. For
    additional details on the refunding of the Palisades sale
    proceeds, see Note 3, Utility Regulation. In May 2009, the
    ALJ’s proposal for decision recommended no PSCR recovery
    for economic development discounts of $3 million and
    disallowance of $4 million of net replacement power costs
    associated with a crane incident at Consumers’ Campbell
    Plant.

(b)

In February 2010, the ALJ’s proposal for decision
    recommended no PSCR recovery for $3 million of economic
    development discounts.

PSCR Plans:

Consumers submitted to the MPSC its 2009
    PSCR plan in September 2008 and its 2010 PSCR plan in September
    2009. Under both of these plans, Consumers requested the
    MPSC’s approval to apply PSCR factors that include recovery
    of an economic development discount provided to a large
    industrial customer. The MPSC approved this discount in 2005 to
    promote long-term investments in the industrial infrastructure
    of Michigan.

In January 2010, the MPSC approved Consumers’ 2009 PSCR
    plan with the exception of the recovery of the discount for the
    large industrial customer. It was determined in the November
    2009 electric rate case order that recovery of this discount
    should be provided through the electric general rates that
    Consumers self-implemented in May 2009. That order, however, did
    not address the recovery of the discount provided from January
    2009 through self-implementation, which totaled $4 million.
    Consumers cannot predict the outcome of this matter, but will
    oppose any attempt to prevent recovery of the unrecovered
    discount.

Also in the November 2009 electric rate case order, the MPSC
    increased the amount of base-PSCR costs Consumers may recover in
    its electric general rates. As a result of this, and the
    MPSC’s decision to allow for recovery of the economic
    development discount through general rates rather than through
    the PSCR, Consumers filed notice with the MPSC in November,
    revising its proposed maximum PSCR factor for 2010. Consumers
    self-implemented this revised 2010 PSCR charge beginning in
    January 2010. While Consumers expects to recover all of its PSCR
    costs, it cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this
    proceeding.

Electric Rate Cases and Self-Implemented Rates:

In
    November 2008, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC
    seeking an annual increase in revenue of $214 million based
    on an 11 percent authorized return on equity. The filing
    sought recovery of costs associated with new plant investments
    including Clean Air Act investments, higher operating and
    maintenance costs, and the approval to recover costs associated
    with Consumers’ smart grid program.

This was the first electric rate case under the new streamlined
    regulatory process enacted by the 2008 Energy Legislation. The
    new provisions generally allow utilities to self-implement rates
    six months after filing, subject to refund with interest, unless
    the MPSC finds good cause to prohibit self-implementation. The
    rate of interest to be charged on refunded amounts is LIBOR plus
    five percent for the appropriate period. For any portion of a
    refund that exceeds 25 percent of the annual revenue
    increase approved by the MPSC in its final order, the rate of
    interest charged would be Consumers’ authorized rate of
    return on equity. The new provisions require the MPSC to issue
    an order 12 months after filing, or the rates, as filed,
    become permanent.



CMS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

CONSUMERS ENERGY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

In April 2009, Consumers filed tariff sheets indicating that it
    planned to self-implement an electric rate increase in the
    annual amount of $179 million beginning in May 2009. The
    MPSC issued an order in May 2009 requiring that, if Consumers
    self-implemented the $179 million electric rate increase,
    it must simultaneously distribute to customers $36 million
    of proceeds from the April 2007 sale of Palisades. Accordingly,
    in May 2009, Consumers self-implemented an annual electric rate
    increase of $179 million, subject to refund with interest,
    and also implemented a one-time distribution of $36 million
    to customers.

In November 2009, the MPSC issued its final order in this case,
    authorizing Consumers to increase its rates by $139 million
    annually, $40 million less than the rate increase
    self-implemented by Consumers. The order reflects an authorized
    return on equity of 10.7 percent and the exclusion from
    rate base of amounts associated with an obligation to the DOE
    for nuclear fuel disposal. The order also requires Consumers to
    refund $73 million of proceeds remaining from the April
    2007 sale of Palisades. The order adopts a “pilot”
    decoupling mechanism effective December 1, 2009, and which,
    subject to certain conditions, will allow rates to be adjusted
    to collect or refund the change in marginal revenue arising from
    the difference between the level of average sales per customer
    adopted in the order and actual average sales per customer. The
    order also adopts an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism
    that will allow rates to be adjusted to collect or refund
    80 percent of the difference between the level of
    uncollectible expense included in rates and actual uncollectible
    expense.

The MPSC directed Consumers to refund to customers the
    difference between the rates it self-implemented in May and the
    rates authorized in this order, plus interest, subject to a
    reconciliation proceeding. As of December 31, 2009, CMS
    Energy and Consumers had a recorded regulatory liability of
    $17 million related to this refund.

In January 2010, the MPSC granted a petition for rehearing filed
    by an intervener. This petition contended that, while the MPSC
    removed the accrued interest associated with an obligation to
    the DOE for nuclear fuel disposal from rate base, it failed to
    deduct the principal of that obligation of $44 million. The
    MPSC agreed and revised its calculation of Consumers’ rate
    base, which resulted in a $5 million decrease in
    Consumers’ annual electric rates. Effectively, the MPSC,
    through its final order and rehearing in this case, has
    authorized Consumers to increase its rates by $134 million
    annually.

In January 2010, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC
    seeking an annual increase in revenue of $178 million based
    on an 11 percent authorized return on equity. The filing
    seeks authority to recover new investments in system
    reliability, environmental compliance, and technology
    advancements. The following table details the components of the
    requested increase in revenue:

Electric Operation and Maintenance Expenditures Show-Cause
    Order:

In December 2005, the MPSC authorized Consumers to
    increase its electric rates. In the same order, the MPSC ordered
    Consumers to spend certain amounts on future tree-trimming and
    line-clearing activities, as well as on the operation and
    maintenance of Consumers’ fossil-fueled power plants. At
    that time, the MPSC also ordered Consumers to establish
    mechanisms to track these expenditures and stated that the rate
    increase was subject to refund with interest if the specified
    amounts were not spent on these activities.

In October 2009, the MPSC issued a show-cause order alleging
    that, in 2007, Consumers spent $14 million less on forestry
    and fossil-fueled plant operation and maintenance activity than
    the amount ordered by the MPSC and



CMS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

that Consumers has not refunded this amount to customers. The
    October 2009 show-cause order directed Consumers to explain why
    it should not be found in violation of the MPSC’s December
    2005 order and subject to applicable sanctions, and why the
    refunds required by that order have not yet occurred.
    Consumers’ response indicated that the total amount it
    spent on forestry and fossil-fueled plant operation and
    maintenance activity for the years 2006 through 2009
    approximated the total amounts included in the December 2005
    order for these activities. While it cannot predict the outcome
    of this proceeding, Consumers does not consider it probable that
    it will be required to provide a refund to customers.
    Accordingly, Consumers has not recorded a provision for revenue
    subject to refund.

Big Rock Decommissioning:

The MPSC and the FERC
    regulate the recovery of Consumers’ costs to decommission
    Big Rock. Subsequent to 2000, Consumers stopped funding a Big
    Rock trust fund because the collection period for an
    MPSC-authorized decommissioning surcharge expired on that date.
    The level of funds provided by the trust fell short of the
    amount needed to complete decommissioning. As a result,
    Consumers provided $44 million of corporate contributions
    for decommissioning costs and recorded this amount as a
    regulatory asset on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In 2008, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking to
    recover the $44 million Big Rock decommissioning shortfall
    from customers. In an order issued in February 2010, the MPSC
    concluded that decommissioning surcharges collected during a
    statutory rate freeze from 2001 through 2003 should have been
    deposited in the decommissioning trust fund. The MPSC agreed
    that Consumers was entitled to the $44 million
    decommissioning shortfall, but concluded that Consumers had
    collected this amount previously through the decommissioning
    surcharge in effect during the rate freeze. The MPSC ordered
    Consumers to refund the $64 million of revenue collected in
    excess of decommissioning costs, plus interest of
    $22 million, over eighteen months. To reflect the impacts
    of this MPSC rate order, Consumers has recognized an
    $86 million regulatory liability on its Consolidated
    Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009, and a charge to income
    of $130 million, which comprises $99 million of
    revenue collected during the rate freeze and $31 million of
    interest.

Consumers has paid $30 million to Entergy to assume
    ownership and responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI, and has
    incurred $55 million for nuclear fuel storage costs as a
    result of the DOE’s failure to accept spent nuclear fuel.
    At December 31, 2009, Consumers had an $85 million
    regulatory asset recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets for
    these costs.

Electric Depreciation:

In February 2010, Consumers
    filed an electric depreciation case. As ordered by the MPSC,
    Consumers prepared a traditional

cost-of-removal

study, which supported a $46 million increase in annual
    depreciation.

Also in February 2010, Consumers filed an electric depreciation
    case for Ludington. This case, filed jointly with Detroit
    Edison, requests an increase in annual depreciation.
    Consumers’ share of this increase is $9 million.
    Consumers cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    these proceedings.

Consumers’
    Gas Utility Rate Matters

Gas Cost Recovery:

The GCR process is designed to
    allow Consumers to recover all of its purchased natural gas
    costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and
    practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices
    in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. Consumers adjusts
    its GCR billing factor monthly in order to minimize the over- or
    underrecovery amount in the annual GCR reconciliation.

The following table summarizes the GCR reconciliation filings
    pending with the MPSC:

GCR Reconciliation for

2007-2008:

In
    December 2009, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers’

2007-2008

GCR reconciliation approving full recovery of $1.7 billion
    in gas costs and authorized Consumers to roll into its

2008-2009

GCR plan the overrecovery of $17 million.

GCR Plans:

In December 2008, Consumers filed
    an application with the MPSC seeking approval of a GCR plan for
    its

2009-2010

GCR plan year. Using the base GCR ceiling factor it proposed in
    this plan, Consumers self-implemented the

2009-2010

GCR charge in April 2009.

In December 2009, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC
    seeking approval of a GCR plan for its

2010-2011

GCR plan year. While Consumers expects to recover all of its GCR
    costs, it cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    these proceedings.

Gas Depreciation:

In September 2009, the MPSC issued
    a final order in Consumers’ gas depreciation case,
    authorizing the use of depreciation rates filed by Consumers in
    August 2008. These rates, previously approved by the MPSC on an
    interim basis in December 2008, reduced Consumers’
    depreciation expense, and its recovery of that expense, by
    $20 million per year. The MPSC also ordered Consumers to
    adopt certain standard retirement units by January 1, 2010.
    Consumers estimates that the use of these standard retirement
    units will increase maintenance expense, and recovery of that
    expense, by $10 million annually. In February 2010, the
    MPSC directed Consumers to begin implementation of the new
    standard retirement units at the same time it implements the
    final rates approved in its pending gas rate case in the spring
    of 2010.

Gas Rate Case:

In May 2009, Consumers filed an
    application with the MPSC seeking an annual increase in revenue
    of $114 million based on an 11 percent authorized
    return on equity. The following table details the components of
    the requested increase in revenue:

Under the new streamlined regulatory process described in the
    “Consumers’ Electric Utility Rate Matters
    — Electric Rate Case and Self-Implemented Rates”
    section of this Note, utilities may be allowed to self-implement
    rates six months after filing, subject to refund with interest,
    unless the MPSC finds good cause to prohibit
    self-implementation. In November 2009, Consumers
    self-implemented a gas rate increase in the annual amount of
    $89 million, subject to refund with interest. Consumers
    does not consider it probable that it will be required to refund
    a material portion of its self-implemented rates.

In January 2010, CMS Energy issued an aggregate of
    $300 million of 6.25 percent senior notes due in 2020.

FMBs:

Consumers secures its FMBs by a mortgage and
    lien on substantially all of its property. Consumers’
    ability to issue FMBs is restricted by certain provisions in the
    First Mortgage Bond Indenture and the need for regulatory
    approvals under federal law. Restrictive issuance provisions in
    the First Mortgage Bond Indenture include achieving a two-times
    interest coverage ratio and having sufficient unfunded net
    property additions.

Regulatory Authorization for Financings:

The FERC
    has authorized Consumers to have outstanding at any one time, up
    to $1.0 billion of secured and unsecured short-term
    securities for general corporate purposes. The remaining
    availability is $520 million at December 31, 2009. The
    FERC has also authorized Consumers to issue and sell up to
    $2.1 billion of secured and unsecured long-term securities
    for general corporate purposes. The remaining availability is
    $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009. The authorizations
    are for the period ending June 30, 2010. Any long-term
    issuances during the authorization period are exempt from the
    FERC’s competitive bidding and negotiated placement
    requirements.

Securitization Bonds:

Certain regulatory assets
    owned by Consumers’ subsidiary, Consumers Funding,
    collateralize Consumers’ Securitization bonds. The
    bondholders have no recourse to Consumers’ other assets.
    Through its rate structure, Consumers bills customers for
    Securitization surcharges to fund the payment of principal,
    interest, and other related expenses. The surcharges collected
    are remitted to a trustee and are not available to creditors of
    Consumers or creditors of Consumers’ affiliates other than
    Consumers Funding. Securitization surcharges totaled
    $46 million in 2009 and $53 million in 2008.

Long-Term Debt — Related Parties:

CMS
    Energy formed a statutory wholly owned business trust for the
    sole purpose of issuing preferred securities and lending the
    gross proceeds to itself. The sole assets of the trust

consists of the debentures described in the following table.
    These debentures have terms similar to those of the mandatorily
    redeemable preferred securities the trust issued. Under current
    accounting rules, CMS Energy does not hold the controlling
    financial interest in the trust preferred security structure.
    Accordingly, this entity is reflected in Long-term debt. Under
    ASU

No. 2009-17,

which is effective for CMS Energy and Consumers January 1,
    2010, CMS Energy expects to consolidate CMS Energy Trust I,
    the issuer of the Trust Preferred Securities. For
    additional details on ASU

Interest expense was $8 million in 2009, $14 million

In the event of default, holders of the Trust Preferred
    Securities would be entitled to exercise and enforce the
    trust’s creditor rights against CMS Energy, which may
    include acceleration of the principal amount due on the
    debentures. CMS Energy has issued certain guarantees with
    respect to payments on the preferred securities. These
    guarantees, when taken together with CMS Energy’s
    obligations under the debentures, related indenture, and trust
    documents, provide full and unconditional guarantees for the

Sale of Accounts Receivable:

Under a revolving
    accounts receivable sales program, Consumers may sell eligible
    accounts receivable to a wholly owned, consolidated,
    bankruptcy-remote special-purpose entity. In turn, the
    special-purpose entity may sell an undivided interest in up to
    $250 million of the receivables, subject to certain
    eligibility requirements. At December 31, 2009,
    $250 million of accounts receivable were eligible for sale,
    of which $50 million were sold. At December 31, 2008,
    $250 million of accounts receivable were eligible for sale,
    of which $170 million were sold.

The purchaser of the receivables has no recourse against
    Consumers’ other assets for failure of a debtor to pay when
    due and no right to any receivables not sold. Consumers and the
    special-purpose entity have accounted for these transfers as
    sales because the transferred receivables have been legally
    isolated from the transferor, the transferee could pledge or
    exchange the receivables, and the transferor did not maintain
    effective control over the receivables. Consumers has not
    recorded a gain or loss on the receivables sold nor retained any
    interest in the receivables sold. Consumers continues to service
    the receivables sold to the special-purpose entity.

    consecutive trading days, including the most recent trading day,
    prior to exercise. This required condition was met at
    December 31, 2009.

The holders of the 3.375 percent senior notes have the
    right to require CMS Energy to purchase the notes at par on
    July 15, 2013 and 2018. The holders of the
    2.875 percent senior notes have the right to require CMS
    Energy to purchase the notes at par on December 1, 2011,
    2014, and 2019.

The securities become convertible for a calendar quarter if the
    price of CMS Energy’s common stock remains at or above the
    trigger price for 20 of 30 consecutive trading days ending on
    the last trading day of the previous quarter. The trigger price
    at which these securities become convertible is 120 percent
    of the conversion price (130 percent for the
    5.5 percent senior notes). The conversion and trigger
    prices are subject to adjustment in certain circumstances,
    including payments or distributions to CMS Energy’s common
    stockholders. The conversion and trigger price adjustment is
    made when the cumulative change in conversion and trigger prices
    is one percent or more. During December 2009, trigger price
    contingencies were met for the 4.50 percent preferred stock
    and 3.375 percent senior notes.



CMS

CONSUMERS ENERGY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

All of CMS Energy’s contingently convertible securities, if
    converted, require CMS Energy to pay cash up to the principal
    (or par) amount of the securities. Any conversion value in
    excess of that amount is paid in shares of CMS Energy’s
    common stock.

In December 2008, 125,000 shares of 4.50 percent
    preferred stock were tendered for conversion which resulted in
    the issuance of 84,592 shares of common stock and payment
    of $6 million in January 2009. In September 2009,
    84,000 shares of 4.50 percent preferred stock were
    tendered for conversion which resulted in the issuance of
    136,712 shares of common stock and payment of
    $4 million in October 2009. In October 2009, 250 ($250,000
    aggregate principal amount) of its 3.375 percent
    convertible senior notes were tendered for conversion which
    resulted in the issuance of 6,634 shares of common stock
    and the payment of less than $1 million in November 2009.

Dividend Restrictions:

Under provisions of CMS
    Energy’s senior notes indenture, at December 31, 2009,
    payment of common stock dividends by CMS Energy was limited to
    $699 million.

Under the provisions of its articles of incorporation, at
    December 31, 2009, Consumers had $333 million of
    unrestricted retained earnings available to pay common stock
    dividends to CMS Energy. Provisions of the Federal Power Act and
    the Natural Gas Act appear to restrict dividends payable by
    Consumers to the amount of Consumers’ retained earnings.
    Several decisions from the FERC suggest that under a variety of
    circumstances common stock dividends from Consumers would not be
    limited to amounts in Consumers’ retained earnings. Any
    decision by Consumers to pay common stock dividends in excess of
    retained earnings would be based on specific facts and
    circumstances and would result only after a formal regulatory
    filing process.

During 2009, CMS Energy received $285 million of common
    stock dividends from Consumers.

Contingently Convertible Securities:

When CMS Energy
    has earnings from continuing operations, its contingently
    convertible securities dilute EPS to the extent that the
    conversion value of a security, which is based on the average
    market price of CMS Energy’s common stock, exceeds the
    principal value of that security. Had there been positive income
    from continuing operations for the year ended December 31,
    2007, contingently convertible securities would have contributed
    an additional 19.7 million shares to the calculation of
    diluted EPS. For additional details on contingently convertible
    securities, see Note 8, Financings and Capitalization.

Stock Options and Warrants:

For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, outstanding options to purchase
    0.4 million shares of common stock had no impact on diluted
    EPS, since the exercise price was greater than the average
    market price of common stock. These stock options have the
    potential to dilute EPS in the future. Had there been positive
    income from continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, options and warrants to purchase
    0.3 million shares of common stock would have been included
    in the calculation of diluted EPS.

Unvested Restricted Stock Awards:

CMS Energy’s
    unvested restricted stock awards accrue cash dividends when
    common stockholders receive dividends. Since the recipient is
    not required to return the dividends to the company if the
    recipient forfeits the award, they are considered participating
    securities. As such, unvested restricted stock awards were
    included in the computation of basic EPS.

Convertible Debentures:

For the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, there was no impact on
    diluted EPS from CMS Energy’s 7.75 percent convertible
    subordinated debentures. Using the if-converted method, the
    debentures would have:

•

increased the numerator of diluted EPS by $5 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2009 and by $9 million for
    each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, from an
    assumed reduction of interest expense, net of tax; and



CMS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

•

increased the denominator of diluted EPS by 2.3 million
    shares for the year ended December 31, 2009 and by
    4.2 million shares for each of the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007.

CMS Energy can revoke the conversion rights if certain
    conditions are met.

    installment loans. EnerBank estimates the fair value of these
    loans using a discounted cash flows technique that incorporates
    current market interest rates as well as assumptions about the
    remaining life of the loans and credit risk. Fair values for
    impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flows or
    underlying collateral values.

CMS Energy and Consumers estimate the fair value of their
    long-term debt using quoted prices from market trades of the
    debt, if available. In the absence of quoted prices, CMS Energy
    and Consumers calculate market yields and prices for the debt
    using a matrix method that incorporates market data for
    similarly rated debt. Depending on the information available,
    other valuation techniques may be used that rely on internal
    assumptions and models. For its convertible securities, CMS
    Energy incorporates, as appropriate, information on the market
    prices of CMS Energy’s common stock. CMS Energy’s
    long-term debt includes $286 million principal amount that
    is supported by third-party insurance or other credit
    enhancements. Of this amount, $271 million principal amount
    is at Consumers. The effects of this third-party credit support
    were excluded from the measurement of fair value at
    December 31, 2009, resulting in a minor reduction to the
    fair value amount.

The mutual fund classified as available for sale consisted of an
    investment in an S&P 500 Index mutual fund. Municipal bonds
    classified as available for sale consisted of investment-grade
    state and municipal bonds. Debt securities classified as held to
    maturity consisted of municipal bonds and mortgage-backed
    securities held by EnerBank.

During 2008, the fair value of CMS Energy’s SERP investment
    in the mutual fund declined from $63 million to
    $39 million. These amounts include the decline in fair
    value of Consumers’ SERP investment in equity securities
    from $41 million to $25 million. CMS Energy and
    Consumers determined that these declines in fair value were
    other than temporary. Accordingly, CMS Energy reclassified net
    unrealized losses of $24 million ($15 million net of
    tax) from AOCL to Other expense on the Consolidated Statements
    of Income (Loss) and established a new cost basis of
    $39 million for these investments, which was equal to fair
    value at December 31, 2008. Consumers reclassified net
    unrealized losses of $16 million ($10 million net of
    tax) from AOCL to Other expense on the Consolidated Statements
    of Income and established a new cost basis of $25 million
    for these investments, which was equal to fair value at
    December 31, 2008.

During 2009, the proceeds from CMS Energy’s sales of SERP
    securities were $53 million, and $8 million of gross
    gains were realized. These amounts include proceeds from
    Consumers’ sales of SERP securities of $32 million,
    and $5 million of realized gross gains. CMS Energy
    reclassified net gains of $5 million from AOCL and included
    this amount in net income in 2009. This amount includes
    Consumers’ reclassification of net gains of $3 million
    from AOCL, which was included in net income in 2009.

During 2008, the proceeds from CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ sales of SERP securities were $2 million,
    and gross gains and losses were immaterial.

During 2007, the proceeds from CMS Energy’s sales of SERP
    securities were $64 million, and $23 million of gross
    gains and $1 million of gross losses were realized. These
    amounts include proceeds from Consumers’ sales of SERP
    securities of $29 million, $11 million of realized
    gross gains, and $1 million of realized gross losses. CMS
    Energy reclassified net gains of $15 million from AOCL and
    included this amount in net loss in 2007. This amount

11: DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS

In order to limit exposure to certain market risks, primarily
    changes in commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign
    exchange rates, CMS Energy and Consumers may enter into various
    risk management contracts, such as forward contracts, futures,
    options, and swaps. In entering into these contracts, they
    follow established policies and procedures under the direction
    of an executive oversight committee consisting of senior
    management representatives and a risk committee consisting of
    business unit managers. Neither CMS Energy nor Consumers holds
    any of its derivatives for trading purposes.

The contracts used to manage market risks may qualify as
    derivative instruments. If a contract is a derivative and does
    not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, the
    contract is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value.
    Each quarter, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to
    reflect any change in the fair value of the contract. Since none
    of CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ derivatives have been
    designated as accounting hedges, all changes in fair value are
    reported in earnings. For a discussion of how CMS Energy and
    Consumers determine the fair value of their derivatives, see
    Note 5, Fair Value Measurements.

Commodity Price Risk:

In order to support
    ongoing operations, CMS Energy and Consumers enter into
    contracts for the future purchase and sale of various
    commodities, such as electricity, natural gas, and coal. These
    forward contracts are generally long-term in nature and result
    in physical delivery of the commodity at a contracted price.
    Most of these contracts are not subject to derivative accounting
    because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units
    specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity
    or bcf of natural gas);

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales
    exception; or

•

there is not an active market for the commodity.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ coal purchase contracts
    are not derivatives because there is not an active market for
    the coal they purchase. If an active market for coal develops in
    the future, some of these contracts may qualify as derivatives.
    For Consumers, which is subject to regulatory accounting, the
    resulting fair value gains and losses would be offset by changes
    in regulatory assets and liabilities and would not affect net
    income. For other subsidiaries, CMS Energy does not believe the
    impact on earnings would be material.

CMS ERM has not designated its contracts to purchase and sell
    electricity and natural gas as normal purchases and sales and,
    therefore, CMS Energy accounts for those contracts as
    derivatives. To manage commodity price risks associated with
    these forward purchase and sale contracts, CMS ERM uses various
    financial instruments, such as swaps, options, and futures. At
    December 31, 2009, CMS ERM held a forward contract for the
    physical sale of 799



CMS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

GWh of electricity through 2015 on behalf of one of CMS
    Energy’s non-utility generating plants. CMS ERM also held
    futures contracts through 2011 as an economic hedge of
    40 percent of the generating plant’s natural gas
    requirements needed to serve a steam sales contract, for a total
    of 0.72 bcf of natural gas. In its role as a marketer of natural
    gas for third-party producers, CMS ERM held forward contracts to
    purchase 5.6 bcf and sell 5.4 bcf of natural gas through 2010
    and a financial contract to sell 0.75 bcf of natural gas as an
    economic hedge of gas storage sales in 2010. At
    December 31, 2009, CMS ERM held financial contracts through
    2010 as an economic hedge against tolling arrangements with a
    purchase of 260 GWh of electricity and a sale of 1.67 bcf of gas.

Interest rate risk:

In order to mitigate its
    exposure to changes in interest rates, Grayling executed an
    interest rate collar as an economic hedge of the variable
    interest rate charged on its outstanding revenue bonds. At
    December 31, 2009, the notional amount of this contract was
    $15 million.

At December 31, 2009, the fair value of Consumers’
    derivative instruments was less than $1 million. The
    following table summarizes the fair values of CMS Energy’s
    derivative instruments:

(a)

This derivative loss relates to a foreign-exchange forward
    contract CMS Energy held at December 31, 2008. CMS Energy
    settled this obligation and the related derivative in January
    2009.

At December 31, 2009, CMS Energy’s derivative
    liabilities subject to credit-risk-related contingent features
    were less than $1 million.

Credit Risk:

CMS Energy’s swaps, options,
    and forward contracts contain credit risk, which is the risk
    that a counterparty will fail to meet its contractual
    obligations. CMS Energy reduces this risk through established
    policies and procedures. CMS Energy assesses credit quality by
    considering credit ratings, financial condition, and other
    available information for counterparties. A credit limit is
    established for counterparties based on the evaluation of its
    credit quality. Exposure to potential loss under each contract
    is monitored and action is taken when appropriate.

CMS ERM enters into contracts primarily with companies in the
    electric and gas industry. This industry concentration may have
    a positive or negative impact on CMS Energy’s exposure to
    credit risk based on how similar changes in economic conditions,
    the weather, or other conditions affect these counterparties.
    CMS ERM reduces its credit risk exposure by using
    industry-standard agreements that allow for netting positive and
    negative exposures associated with the same counterparty.
    Typically, these agreements also allow each party to demand
    adequate assurance of future performance from the other party,
    when there is reason to do so.

At December 31, 2009, if counterparties within this
    industry concentration all failed to meet their contractual
    obligations, the loss to CMS Energy on contracts accounted for
    as derivatives would be less than $1 million.

12: RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

CMS Energy and Consumers provide pension, OPEB, and other
    retirement benefit plans to employees under a number of
    different plans, including:

•

a non-contributory, qualified defined benefit Pension Plan
    (closed to new non-union participants as of July 1, 2003
    and closed to new union participants as of September 1,
    2005);



CMS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

•

a qualified cash balance Pension Plan for certain employees
    hired between July 1, 2003 and August 31, 2005;

•

a non-contributory, qualified DCCP for employees hired on or
    after September 1, 2005;

•

benefits to certain management employees under a
    non-contributory, nonqualified defined benefit SERP (closed to
    new participants as of March 31, 2006);

•

benefits to certain management employees under a
    non-contributory, nonqualified DC SERP hired on or after
    April 1, 2006;

•

health care and life insurance benefits under an OPEB plan;

•

benefits to a selected group of management under a
    non-contributory, nonqualified EISP; and

•

a contributory, qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan.

Pension Plan:

The Pension Plan includes funds
    for most of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ current
    employees, the employees of their subsidiaries, and Panhandle, a
    former CMS Energy subsidiary. The Pension Plan’s assets are
    not distinguishable by company.

On September 1, 2005, CMS Energy and Consumers implemented
    the DCCP. The DCCP provides an employer contribution of five
    percent of base pay to the existing employees’ 401(k) plan.
    No employee contribution is required in order to receive the
    plan’s employer contribution. All employees hired on or
    after September 1, 2005 participate in this plan.
    Participants in the cash balance Pension Plan, in effect from
    July 1, 2003 to September 1, 2005, also participate in
    the DCCP as of September 1, 2005. Additional pay credits
    under the cash balance Pension Plan were discontinued as of that
    date. The DCCP expense for both CMS Energy and Consumers was
    $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, and
    $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

SERP:

SERP benefits are paid from a trust
    established in 1988. SERP is not a qualified plan under the
    Internal Revenue Code. SERP trust earnings are taxable and trust
    assets are included in CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    consolidated assets. The following table provides information
    regarding the SERP trust for CMS Energy and Consumers.

On April 1, 2006, CMS Energy and Consumers implemented a DC
    SERP and froze further new participation in the defined benefit
    SERP. The DC SERP provides participants benefits ranging from
    5 percent to 15 percent of total compensation. The DC
    SERP requires a minimum of five years of participation before
    vesting. CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ contributions to
    the plan, if any, will be placed in a grantor trust. For CMS
    Energy and Consumers, trust

assets were less than $1 million at December 31, 2009
    and 2008. The assets are classified as Other non-current assets
    on their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets. The DC SERP
    expense for CMS Energy and Consumers was less than
    $1 million for each of the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008, and 2007.

401(k):

The employer’s match for the 401(k) plan is
    60 percent on eligible contributions up to the first six
    percent of an employee’s wages. The total 401(k) plan cost
    for CMS Energy, including Consumers, was $16 million for
    each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
    $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The
    total 401(k) plan cost for Consumers was $15 million for
    each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
    $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

EISP:

CMS Energy and Consumers implemented a
    nonqualified EISP in 2002 to provide flexibility in separation
    of employment by officers, a selected group of management, or
    other highly compensated employees. Terms of the plan may
    include payment of a lump sum, payment of monthly benefits for
    life, payment of premiums for continuation of health care, or
    any other legally permissible term deemed to be in CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ best interest to offer. The
    EISP expense for CMS Energy and Consumers was less than
    $1 million for each of the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008, and 2007. The ABO for the EISP for CMS Energy,
    including Consumers, was $4 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008. The ABO for the EISP for Consumers was
    $1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

OPEB:

The OPEB plan covers all regular
    full-time employees who are covered by the employee health care
    plan on the day before they retire from the company at
    age 55 or older and who have at least ten full years of
    applicable continuous service. Regular full-time employees who
    qualify for a Pension Plan disability retirement and have
    15 years of applicable continuous service are also
    eligible. Retiree health care costs were based on the assumption
    that costs would increase 8.5 percent for those under 65
    and 8.0 percent for those over 65 in 2009 and 2010. The
    rate of increase is assumed to slow to five percent for those
    under and over 65 by 2017 and thereafter.

The health care cost-trend rate assumption affects the estimated
    costs recorded. A change of one percentage point in the health
    care cost-trend assumption would have the following effects:

In 1992, Consumers recorded a liability of $466 million for
    the accumulated transition obligation and a corresponding
    regulatory asset for anticipated recovery in utility rates. The
    MPSC authorized recovery of the electric utility portion of
    these costs in 1994 over 18 years and the gas utility
    portion in 1996 over 16 years.

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans Amendments:

In September 2006,
    the FASB issued an amended standard for accounting for
    employers’ defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans. This standard required CMS Energy and Consumers to
    recognize the funded status of their defined benefit
    postretirement plans on their Consolidated Balance Sheets at
    December 31, 2006. The standard also required CMS Energy
    and Consumers to recognize changes in the funded status of their
    plans in the year in which the changes occur. In addition, the
    standard required that CMS Energy and Consumers change their
    plan measurement date from November 30 to December 31,
    effective December 31, 2008. In the first quarter of 2008,
    CMS Energy and Consumers recorded the measurement date change,
    which resulted in a $6 million

net-of-tax

decrease to retained earnings, a $4 million reduction to
    regulatory assets, a $7 million increase in Postretirement
    benefit liabilities, and a $5 million increase in Deferred
    tax assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In April 2008, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers’ PSCR
    case that allowed Consumers to collect a one-time surcharge
    under a pension and OPEB equalization mechanism. For 2008,
    Consumers collected $10 million of pension and
    $2 million of OPEB surcharge revenue in electric rates.
    Consumers recorded a reduction of $12 million of
    equalization regulatory assets on its Consolidated Balance
    Sheets and an increase of $12 million of expense on its
    Consolidated Statements of Income. Thus, Consumers’
    collection of the equalization mechanism surcharge had no impact
    on net income for the year ended December 31, 2008.

(a)

The discount rate is set to reflect the rates at which benefits
    could be effectively settled. It is set equal to the equivalent
    single rate that results from a yield curve analysis
    incorporating projected benefit payments specific to CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans and the yields on high quality
    corporate bonds rated Aa or better.

(b)

CMS Energy and Consumers determine their long-term rate of
    return by considering historical market returns, the current and
    expected future economic environment, the capital market
    principles of risk and return, and the expert opinions of
    individuals and firms with financial market knowledge. CMS
    Energy and Consumers consider the asset allocation of the
    portfolio in forecasting the future expected total return of the
    portfolio. The goal is to determine a long-term rate of return
    that can be incorporated into the planning of future cash flow
    requirements in conjunction with the change in the liability.
    Annually, CMS Energy and Consumers review for

reasonableness and appropriateness the forecasted returns for
    various classes of assets used to construct an expected return
    model. CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ expected long-term
    rate of return on Pension Plan assets was 8.25 percent in
    2009. The 2009 actual return on Pension Plan assets was
    21 percent, and for 2008 the actual return was a negative
    23 percent.

(c)

The mortality assumption is based on the RP-2000 mortality
    tables with projection of future mortality improvements using
    Scale AA, which aligns with the IRS prescriptions for cash
    funding valuations under the Pension Protection Act.

    included in rates and the periodic benefit cost calculated. The
    pension regulatory asset had a balance of $29 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. The OPEB regulatory asset had a
    balance of $5 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined
    benefit Pension Plans that will be amortized into net periodic
    benefit cost in 2010 for CMS Energy from the regulatory asset is
    $55 million and from AOCL is $3 million. The estimated
    net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit Pension
    Plans that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost in
    2010 for Consumers from the regulatory asset is
    $55 million. The estimated net loss and prior service
    credit for OPEB plans that will be amortized into net periodic
    benefit cost in 2010 for CMS Energy from the regulatory asset is
    $23 million and a decrease from AOCL of $1 million.
    The estimated net loss and prior service credit for OPEB plans
    that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost in 2010
    for Consumers from the regulatory asset is $23 million.

CMS Energy and Consumers amortize gains and losses in excess of
    ten percent of the greater of the benefit obligation and the MRV
    over the average remaining service period. The estimated time of
    amortization of gains and losses for CMS Energy and Consumers is
    12 years for pension and 14 years for OPEB. Prior
    service cost amortization is established in the years in which
    the prior service cost first occurred, and are based on the same
    amortization period in all future years until the prior service
    costs are fully recognized. The estimated time of

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
    Act of 2003 establishes a prescription drug benefit under
    Medicare (Medicare Part D) and a federal subsidy,
    which is tax-exempt, to sponsors of retiree health care benefit
    plans that provide a benefit that is actuarially equivalent to
    Medicare Part D. The Medicare Part D annualized
    reduction in net OPEB cost for CMS Energy was $19 million
    for 2009 and $25 million for 2008 and for Consumers was
    $18 million for 2009 and $24 million for 2008. The
    reduction for CMS Energy and Consumers includes $6 million
    for 2009 and $7 million for 2008 in capitalized OPEB costs.

NOTES TO

(b)

CMS Energy plans to contribute $19 million to its Pension
    Plan in 2010 and Consumers plans to contribute $18 million
    to its Pension Plan in 2010.

Contributions include required and discretionary amounts. Actual
    future contributions will depend on future investment
    performance, changes in discount rates, and various factors
    related to the populations participating in the plans.

In 2008, CMS Energy adjusted its target asset allocation for
    Pension Plan assets to 50 percent equity, 30 percent
    fixed income, and 20 percent alternative-strategy
    investments from the previous target of 60 percent equity,
    30 percent fixed income, and 10 percent
    alternative-strategy investments. This adjustment is being made
    gradually by the allocation of contributions into alternative
    assets and the drawdown of equities to cover plan benefit
    payments and distributions. This revised target asset allocation
    is expected to continue to maximize the long-term return on plan
    assets, while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of
    acceptable risk is a function of the liabilities of the plan.
    Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S&P
    500 Index, with lesser allocations to the S&P MidCap and
    SmallCap Indexes and Foreign Equity Funds. Fixed-income
    investments are diversified across investment grade instruments
    of government and corporate issuers as well as high-yield and
    global bond funds. Alternative strategies are diversified across
    absolute return investment approaches and global tactical asset
    allocation. CMS Energy and Consumers use annual liability
    measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic
    asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to
    the portfolio allocation.

CMS Energy and Consumers established union and non-union VEBA
    trusts to fund their future retiree health and life insurance
    benefits. These trusts are funded through the ratemaking process
    for Consumers and through direct contributions from the
    non-utility subsidiaries. CMS Energy and Consumers have a target
    asset allocation of 60 percent equity and 40 percent
    fixed-income investments. CMS Energy and Consumers invest the
    equity portions of the union and non-union health care VEBA
    trusts in a S&P 500 Index fund. CMS Energy and Consumers
    invest the fixed-income portion of the union health care VEBA
    trust in domestic investment grade taxable instruments. CMS
    Energy and Consumers invest the fixed-income portion of the
    non-union health care VEBA trust in a diversified mix of
    domestic tax-exempt securities. The investment selections of
    each VEBA trust are influenced by the tax consequences, as well
    as the objective of generating asset returns that will meet the
    medical and life insurance costs of retirees.

Benefit Payments:

The expected benefit
    payments for each of the next five years and the five-year
    period thereafter are as follows:

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(a)

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ OPEB benefit payments are
    net of employee contributions and expected Medicare Part D
    prescription drug subsidy payments. For CMS Energy, subsidies to
    be received are estimated to be $6 million for each of 2010
    and 2011, $7 million for 2012, $8 million for each of
    2013 and 2014, and $50 million combined for 2015 through
    2019. For Consumers, subsidies to be received are estimated to
    be $5 million for 2010, $6 million for 2011,
    $7 million for each of 2012 and 2013, $8 million for
    2014, and $48 million combined for 2015 through 2019.

13: INCOME
    TAXES

CMS Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal
    income tax return and a unitary Michigan income tax return.
    Income taxes generally are allocated based on each
    company’s separate taxable income in accordance with the
    CMS Energy tax sharing agreement.

Deferred tax accounting is used for temporary differences. These
    occur when there are differences between the book and tax
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. ITC has been
    deferred and is being amortized over the estimated service lives
    of the related properties.

AMT paid generally becomes a tax credit that CMS Energy can
    carry forward indefinitely to reduce regular tax liabilities in
    future periods when regular taxes paid exceed the tax calculated
    for AMT. At December 31, 2009, CMS Energy had AMT credit
    carryforwards of $273 million. As these carryforwards do
    not expire, no valuation allowance was required.

CMS Energy also had federal tax loss carryforwards of
    $1.3 billion and a local tax loss carryforward of
    $433 million. These carryforwards expire from 2023 through
    2028. Consumers’ portion of the federal tax loss
    carryforward was $73 million. CMS Energy and Consumers
    expect to use the federal tax loss carryforward prior to its
    expiration; thus, no valuation allowance was required. A
    valuation allowance of $2 million was provided for the
    local tax loss carryforward.

In addition, CMS Energy had general business credit
    carryforwards of $35 million that expire from 2010 through
    2030, of which $11 million was Consumers’ portion. A
    valuation allowance of $2 million was provided for these
    items. It is reasonably possible that further adjustments will
    be made to the valuation allowance within one year.

Furthermore, at December 31, 2009, CMS Energy had a net
    benefit of $166 million for future Michigan tax deductions
    granted as part of the MBT legislation of 2007. This benefit
    comprises a $194 million benefit at Consumers, offset
    partially by $28 million related to CMS Energy.

Current tax expense reflects the settlement of income tax audits
    for prior years, as well as the provision for the current
    year’s income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary
    differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and
    the reported amounts in CMS Energy’s consolidated financial
    statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified
    as current or non-current according to the classification of the
    related assets or liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities not related to assets or liabilities are classified
    according to the expected reversal date of the temporary
    differences.

The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by
    federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in
    proposed assessments. CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is
    highly judgmental. CMS Energy and Consumers believe that their
    accrued tax liabilities at December 31, 2009 are adequate
    for all years. The years 2002 through 2007 are under audit by
    the IRS.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Prior to 2007, U.S. income taxes were not recorded on the
    undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that had been or
    were intended to be reinvested indefinitely. During the first
    quarter of 2007, CMS Energy announced plans to sell
    substantially all of the foreign assets or subsidiaries. These
    sales resulted in the recognition in 2007 of $71 million of
    U.S. income tax expense associated with the change in
    assumption regarding permanent reinvestment of these
    undistributed earnings, with $46 million of this amount
    reflected in income from continuing operations and
    $25 million in discontinued operations. Additionally, gains
    on the sales of CMS Energy’s international investments
    resulted in the release of $121 million of valuation
    allowance during 2007.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the balance at December 31, 2009 were
    $54 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. This entire
    amount related to Consumers. Because of the impact of deferred
    tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the
    disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not
    affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
    payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.
    CMS Energy had unrecognized tax benefits of $8 million at
    December 31, 2009, $10 million at December 31,
    2008, and $8 million at December 31, 2007 that if
    recognized would affect the annual effective tax rate in future
    years. At December 31, 2009, $3 million of such
    unrecognized tax benefits related to Consumers. There were no
    uncertain tax benefits that would reduce Consumers’
    effective tax rate at December 31, 2008 and 2007. It is
    reasonably possible that, within the next twelve months, a
    settlement will be reached with the IRS on Consumers’
    capitalized overhead cost methodology, a timing issue. An
    estimate of a settlement range cannot be made at this point.

CMS Energy and Consumers recognize accrued interest and
    penalties, where applicable, related to uncertain tax benefits
    as part of income tax expense. CMS Energy recognized less than
    $1 million of interest for the year ended December 31,
    2009, $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    and $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
    No interest has been recognized at Consumers related to
    uncertain tax benefits. CMS Energy had accrued interest recorded
    of $3 million for each of the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008.

14: STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

CMS Energy and Consumers provide a PISP to key employees and
    non-employee directors based on their contributions to the
    successful management of the company. The PISP has a five-year
    term, expiring in May 2014.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

All grants under the PISP for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were in the
    form of TSR restricted stock and time-lapse restricted stock.
    Restricted stock recipients receive shares of CMS Energy Common
    Stock that have full dividend and voting rights. TSR restricted
    stock vesting is contingent on meeting a three-year service
    requirement and specific market conditions. For awards granted
    in 2008 and 2007, half of the market condition is based on the
    achievement of specified levels of TSR over a three-year period
    and half is based on a comparison of CMS Energy’s TSR with
    the median total stockholders’ return of a peer group over
    the same three-year period. Depending on the performance of the
    market, a recipient may earn a total award ranging from zero to
    150 percent of the initial grant. For awards granted in
    2009, the market condition is based entirely on a comparison of
    CMS Energy’s TSR with the median stockholders’ return
    of a peer group over the same three-year period. Depending on
    the performance of the market, a recipient may earn a total
    award ranging from zero to 200 percent of the initial
    grant. Time-lapse restricted stock vests after a service period
    of three years. Restricted stock awards granted to officers in
    2007 and 2008 were 80 percent TSR restricted stock and
    20 percent time-lapsed restricted stock. Awards granted to
    officers in 2009 were 67 percent TSR restricted stock and
    33 percent time-lapse restricted stock.

All restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if
    employment terminates before the end of the vesting period. If,
    however, certain minimum service requirements are met or are
    waived by action of the Compensation and Human Resources
    Committee of the Board of Directors, restricted shares may vest
    fully upon:

•

retirement;

•

disability; or

•

change of control of CMS Energy, as defined by the individual
    award or, in the absence of such definition, as defined by the
    PISP.

The PISP also allows for stock options, stock appreciation
    rights, phantom shares, and performance units, none of which
    were granted in 2009, 2008, or 2007.

Shares awarded or subject to stock options, phantom shares, or
    performance units may not exceed 6 million shares from June
    2009 through May 2014, nor may such awards to any recipient
    exceed 500,000 shares in any fiscal year. CMS Energy and
    Consumers may issue awards of up to 5,285,993 shares of
    common stock under the PISP at December 31, 2009. Shares
    for which payment or exercise is in cash, as well as forfeited
    shares or stock options, may be awarded or granted again under
    the PISP.

During 2009, CMS Energy granted 407,000 TSR shares and 392,007
    time-lapse shares of restricted stock. During 2009, Consumers
    granted 351,800 TSR shares and 359,347 time-lapse shares of
    restricted stock.

(b)

During 2009, 224,000 TSR shares granted by CMS Energy in 2006
    were forfeited due to the failure to meet the specific market
    conditions. During 2009, 173,775 TSR shares granted by Consumers
    in 2006 were forfeited due to the failure to meet the specific
    market conditions.

CMS Energy and Consumers charge the fair value of the awards to
    expense over the required service period. As a result, CMS
    Energy and Consumers recognize all compensation expense for
    share-based awards that have accelerated service provisions upon
    retirement by the period in which the employee becomes eligible
    to retire. CMS Energy and Consumers calculate the fair value of
    time-lapse restricted stock based on the price of CMS
    Energy’s common stock on the grant date. CMS Energy and
    Consumers calculate the fair value of TSR restricted stock
    awards on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. CMS
    Energy and Consumers base expected volatilities on the
    historical volatility of the price of CMS Energy Common Stock.

The risk-free rate for each valuation was based on the
    three-year U.S. Treasury yield at the award grant date. The
    following table summarizes the significant assumptions used to
    estimate the fair value of the TSR restricted stock awards:

Stock options give the holder the right to purchase common stock
    at the market price on the grant date. Stock options are
    exercisable upon grant, and expire up to ten years and one month
    from the grant date. CMS Energy and Consumers issue new shares
    when recipients exercise stock options. The total intrinsic
    value of stock options exercised for CMS Energy was less than
    $1 million in 2009, $1 million in 2008, and
    $9 million in 2007. The total intrinsic value of stock
    options exercised for Consumers was less than $1 million in
    2009 and 2008 and $6 million in 2007. Cash received from
    exercise of these stock options in 2009 was less than
    $1 million for CMS Energy and less than $1 million for
    Consumers.

Since CMS Energy has utilized tax loss carryforwards, CMS Energy
    was unable to realize excess tax benefits upon exercise of stock
    options and vesting of restricted stock. Therefore, CMS Energy
    did not recognize the related excess tax benefits in equity. As
    of December 31, 2009, CMS Energy has $18 million of
    unrealized excess tax benefits.

LEASES

CMS Energy and Consumers lease various assets, including service
    vehicles, railcars, gas pipeline capacity, and buildings. In
    addition, CMS Energy and Consumers account for a number of their
    PPAs as capital and operating leases.

Operating leases for coal-carrying railcars have lease terms
    expiring over the next 15 years. These leases contain fair
    market value extension and buyout provisions, with some
    providing for predetermined extension period rentals. Capital
    leases for Consumers’ vehicle fleet operations have a
    maximum term of 120 months and TRAC

end-of-life

provisions.

Consumers has capital leases for gas transportation pipelines to
    the Karn generating complex and Zeeland. The capital lease for
    the gas transportation pipeline into the Karn generating complex
    has a term of 15 years with a provision to extend the
    contract from month to month. The capital lease for the gas
    transportation pipeline to Zeeland has a lease term of
    12 years with a renewal provision at the end of the
    contract. The remaining terms of Consumers’ long-term PPAs
    range between 1 and 21 years. Most of these PPAs contain
    provisions at the end of the initial contract terms to renew the
    agreements annually.

Consumers is authorized by the MPSC to record both capital and
    operating lease payments as operating expense and recover the
    total cost from customers. The following table summarizes CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ capital and operating lease

(a)

In April 2007, Consumers sold Palisades to Entergy and entered
    into a

15-year

PPA
    to buy all of the capacity and energy produced by Palisades.
    Consumers has continuing involvement with Palisades through
    security provided to Entergy for Consumers’ PPA obligation,
    Consumers’ DOE liability, and other forms of involvement.
    Because of these ongoing arrangements, Consumers accounted for
    the transaction as a financing of Palisades and not a sale.
    Accordingly, no gain on the sale of Palisades was recognized on
    the Consolidated Statements of Income. Consumers accounted for
    the remaining non-real-estate assets and liabilities associated
    with the transaction as a sale.

Palisades remains on Consumers’ Consolidated Balance Sheets
    and Consumers continues to depreciate it. Consumers recorded the
    related proceeds as a finance obligation with payments recorded
    to interest expense and the finance obligation based on the
    amortization of the obligation over the life of the Palisades
    PPA. The value of the finance obligation was determined based on
    an allocation of the transaction proceeds to the fair values of
    the net assets sold and fair value of the plant asset under the
    financing. Total amortization and interest charges under the
    financing were $23 million for each of the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

ASSET RETIREMENT
    OBLIGATIONS

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations:

CMS
    Energy and Consumers record the fair value of the cost to remove
    assets at the end of their useful lives, if there is a legal
    obligation to remove them.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the
    period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with
    indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. CMS Energy and
    Consumers have not recorded liabilities for assets that have
    insignificant cumulative disposal costs, such as substation
    batteries.

Consumers includes its share of the direct expenses of the
    jointly owned plants in Operating Expenses. Consumers shares
    operation, maintenance, and other expenses of these jointly
    owned utility facilities in proportion to each
    participant’s undivided ownership interest. Consumers is

EQUITY METHOD
    INVESTMENTS

CMS Energy accounts for certain investments in other companies
    and partnerships using the equity method when it has significant
    influence, typically when ownership is more than 20 percent
    but less than a majority. Losses from equity method investments
    were $2 million in 2009, and earnings from equity method
    investments were $5 million in 2008 and $40 million in
    2007. The amount of consolidated retained earnings that
    represents undistributed earnings from these equity method
    investments was $1 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $22 million at December 31, 2007.

If assets or income from continuing operations associated with
    any of CMS Energy’s individual equity method investments,
    or on an aggregate basis by any combination of equity method
    investments, exceed ten percent of its consolidated assets or
    income, then CMS Energy must present summarized financial data
    of that subsidiary or combination of subsidiaries. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, no individual equity method
    investment or combination of investments exceeded the ten
    percent threshold.

CONSOLIDATION OF
    VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

Entities that are VIEs must be consolidated if the reporting
    company determines that it will absorb a majority of the
    VIE’s expected losses, receive a majority of the VIE’s
    residual returns, or both. The company that is required to
    consolidate the VIE is called the primary beneficiary. Variable
    interests are contractual, ownership, or other interests in an
    entity that change as the fair value of the entity’s net
    assets, excluding variable interests, change. An entity is
    considered to be a VIE when its capital is insufficient to
    permit it to finance its activities without additional
    subordinated financial support or its equity investors, as a
    group, lack the characteristics of having a controlling
    financial interest. CMS Energy and Consumers examine the
    following factors when determining whether they are the primary
    beneficiary of a VIE:

Sale of revenue bonds that mature in November 2012 and bear

    letter of credit equal to the outstanding balance.

40 MW

Wood waste- fueled

    fixed rates.  The debt is non-recourse to the partnership and
    secured by a CMS Energy guarantee capped at $3 million annually.

38 MW

Total

151 MW

CMS Energy consolidated these entities for all periods
    presented. Total assets of these VIEs were $189 million as
    of December 31, 2009 and $196 million as of
    December 31, 2008. Total liabilities of these VIEs were
    $92 million as of December 31, 2009 and
    $99 million as of December 31, 2008.

CMS Energy has operating and management contracts with these
    partnerships and Consumers is the primary purchaser of power
    from each partnership through long-term PPAs. Consumers also has
    reduced dispatch agreements with Grayling and Genesee, which
    allow the relative facilities to be dispatched based on the
    market price of wood waste. This results in fuel cost savings
    that each partnership shares with Consumers’ customers.

The partnerships have third-party debt obligations totaling
    $70 million at December 31, 2009 and $76 million
    at December 31, 2008. Property, plant, and equipment
    serving as collateral for these obligations have a carrying
    value of $137 million at December 31, 2009 and
    $145 million at December 31, 2008. The creditors of
    these partnerships do not have recourse to the general credit of
    CMS Energy or Consumers, except through outstanding letters of
    credit of $2 million and a guarantee of $3 million
    annually. CMS Energy has deferred collections on certain
    receivables owed by Genesee. CMS Energy’s maximum exposure
    to loss from these receivables is

$6 million. Consumers has not provided any financial or
    other support during the periods presented that was not
    previously contractually required.

Additionally, through CMS Energy’s trust preferred security
    structure, CMS Energy holds an interest in a VIE in which CMS
    Energy is not the primary beneficiary. CMS Energy’s maximum
    exposure to loss through its interest is limited to its related
    party long-term debt balance of $34 million. For additional
    information, see Note 8, Financings and Capitalization,
    “Long-Term Debt — Related Parties.”

CMS

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

In connection with the sale of CMS Energy’s Argentine and
    Michigan assets to Lucid Energy in March 2007, CMS Energy
    entered into agreements that granted MEI, an affiliate of Lucid
    Energy, the right to any proceeds from an assignment of the
    ICSID award associated with TGN. The agreements also granted MEI
    an option to purchase CMS Gas Transmission’s ownership
    interests in TGN, and the rights to any proceeds CMS Enterprises
    will receive if it sells its stock interest in CMS Generation
    San Nicolas Company.

In June 2008, CMS Energy executed an agreement with MEI and a
    third party to assign the ICSID award and to sell its interests
    in TGN directly to the third party. In accordance with the
    agreements executed in March 2007, the proceeds from the
    assignment of the ICSID award and the sale of TGN were passed on
    to MEI and CMS Energy recognized an $8 million gain on the
    assignment of the ICSID award in Gain on asset sales, net on CMS
    Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). CMS
    Energy also recognized a $197 million cumulative net
    foreign currency translation loss related to TGN, which had been
    deferred as a Foreign currency translation component of
    stockholders’ equity. This charge was fully offset by the
    elimination of a $197 million Argentine currency impairment
    reserve on CMS Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets,
    created when it impaired its investment in TGN in March 2007.
    For additional details, see “Impairment Charges”
    within this Note.

As of December 31, 2009, $7 million remained as a
    deferred credit on CMS Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets
    related to MEI’s right to proceeds that CMS Enterprises
    will receive if it sells its stock interest in CMS Generation
    San Nicolas Company.

Discontinued
    Operations

Discontinued operations are a component of CMS Energy’s
    enterprises business segment. CMS Energy included the following
    amounts in the Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations line

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Discontinued operations include a provision for closing costs
    and a portion of CMS Energy’s parent company interest
    expense. CMS Energy allocated interest expense of less than
    $1 million in 2009 and $1 million in each of the years
    2008 and 2007. This allocation was equal to the net book value
    of the asset sold divided by CMS Energy’s total
    capitalization of each discontinued operation multiplied by CMS
    Energy’s interest expense.

Pending Asset Sales:

During the fourth quarter
    of 2009, management committed to a plan to sell its interest in
    Exeter and initiated an active program to locate potential
    buyers. CMS Energy expects to complete the sale of this asset in
    2010. As a result, the major classes of assets and liabilities
    of Exeter were classified as held for sale on CMS Energy’s
    Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2009. They are as follows:

Since the fair value of CMS Energy’s investment in Exeter
    less costs to sell exceeded the carrying amount, no charge to
    income was recognized as a result of Exeter being classified as
    held for sale.

Impairment
    Charges

CMS Energy recorded no impairments of long-lived assets for the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Consumers recorded
    no impairments of long-lived assets for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. The following table

REPORTABLE
    SEGMENTS

Reportable segments consist of business units defined by the
    products and services they offer. CMS Energy and Consumers
    evaluate performance based on the net income (loss) available to
    common stockholders of each segment. The reportable segments for
    CMS Energy and Consumers are:

CMS Energy:

•

electric utility, consisting of regulated activities associated
    with the generation and distribution of electricity in Michigan;

•

gas utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with
    the transportation, storage, and distribution of natural gas in
    Michigan;

•

enterprises, consisting of various subsidiaries engaging
    primarily in domestic independent power production; and

•

other, including corporate interest and other expenses and
    discontinued operations.

Consumers:

•

electric utility, consisting of regulated activities associated
    with the generation and distribution of electricity in Michigan;

•

gas utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with
    the transportation, storage, and distribution of natural gas in
    Michigan; and

•

other, including a consolidated special-purpose entity for the
    sale of accounts receivable.

Accounting policies for CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    segments are as described in Note 1, Significant Accounting
    Policies. The consolidated financial statements reflect the
    assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the individual
    segments when appropriate. Accounts are allocated among the
    segments when common accounts are attributable to more than one
    segment. The allocations are based on certain measures of
    business activities, such as revenue, labor dollars, customers,
    other operation and maintenance expense, construction expense,
    leased property, taxes, or functional surveys. For example,
    customer receivables are allocated based on revenue, and pension
    provisions are allocated based on labor dollars.

Inter-segment sales and transfers are accounted for at current
    market prices and are eliminated in consolidated net income
    (loss) available to common stockholders by segment.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

CMS Energy Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of income (loss), of cash
    flows, and of changes in equity present fairly, in all material
    respects, the financial position of CMS Energy Corporation and
    its subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and December 31,
    2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) present fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report
    on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of income, of cash flows,
    and of changes in equity present fairly, in all material
    respects, the financial position of Consumers Energy Company and
    its subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and December 31,

ITEM 9A. CMS
    ENERGY’S CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
    and Procedures

: Under the supervision and with the
    participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMS
    Energy conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and
    procedures (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, CMS
    Energy’s CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
    2009.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

: CMS Energy’s management is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

CMS Energy’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    GAAP and includes policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of CMS Energy;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of CMS
    Energy are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of CMS Energy; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of CMS
    Energy’s assets that could have a material effect on its
    financial statements.

Management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its
    internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all
    fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
    design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
    resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
    considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation
    of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those
    internal controls may become inadequate in future periods
    because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including its CEO and CFO, CMS Energy conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this
    evaluation, management used the criteria set forth in the
    framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, CMS Energy’s
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009. The
    effectiveness of CMS Energy’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
    under Item 8.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting:

There have been no changes in CMS
    Energy’s internal control over financial reporting during
    the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its
    internal control over financial reporting.



ITEM 9A(T).
    CONSUMERS’ CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
    and Procedures:

Under the supervision and with the
    participation of management, including its CEO and CFO,
    Consumers conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and
    procedures (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation,
    Consumers’ CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
    2009.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting:

Consumers’ management is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Consumers’ internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    GAAP and includes policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of Consumers;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of
    Consumers are being made only in accordance with authorizations
    of management and directors of Consumers; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
    Consumers’ assets that could have a material effect on its
    financial statements.

Management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its
    internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all
    fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
    design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
    resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
    considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation
    of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those
    internal controls may become inadequate in future periods
    because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including its CEO and CFO, Consumers conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this
    evaluation, management used the criteria set forth in the
    framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, Consumers’
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009. The
    effectiveness of Consumers’ internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under
    Item 8.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting:

There have been no changes in
    Consumers’ internal control over financial reporting during
    the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its
    internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 11.
    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Information that is required in Item 11 regarding executive
    compensation of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ executive
    officers is included in CMS Energy’s definitive proxy
    statement, which is incorporated by reference herein.

OFFICER INCENTIVE
    COMPENSATION PLAN

On February 23, 2010, the C&HR Committees approved the
    payout of cash bonuses for 2009 under the Annual Officer
    Incentive Compensation Plan. The C&HR Committees approved
    achievement of the composite plan performance factor resulting
    in payout under this plan at 148 percent.

On January 28, 2010, the C&HR Committees approved the
    material terms of this plan, including the 2010 corporate
    performance goals thereunder. This plan includes the material
    terms detailed below, although the specific target levels for
    the corporate performance goals vary from year to year.

Corporate Performance:

The composite plan
    performance factor depends on corporate performance in two areas
    as described in the plan: (1) the adjusted net income per
    outstanding CMS Energy common share, called Plan EPS; and
    (2) the corporate free cash flow of CMS Energy, called
    CFCF. Plan EPS performance constitutes 60 percent of the
    composite plan performance factor and CFCF performance
    constitutes 40 percent of the composite plan performance
    factor. There will be a payout under the plan if either Plan EPS
    performance is not less than ten cents below target EPS or CFCF
    is not less than $100 million below target CFCF. Even if
    only one but not both of these target minimums is achieved, a
    partial payout would result. The composite plan performance
    factor to be used for payouts is capped at a maximum of
    200 percent. Annual awards under the plan to
    Consumers’ officers may be reduced by ten percent in the
    event that there is no payout to non-officer, non-union
    employees under a separate Consumers’ employee incentive
    plan and may be increased by ten percent in the event that the
    maximum payout is made to non-officer, non-union employees under
    the Consumers’ employee incentive plan.

Annual Award Formula:

Annual awards for each
    eligible officer will be based upon a standard award percentage
    of the officer’s base salary as in effect for the
    performance year. The maximum amount that can be awarded under
    the plan for any Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m)
    employee will not exceed $2.5 million in any one
    performance year. Annual awards for officers will be calculated
    and made as follows: Individual Award = Base Salary times
    Standard Award Percentage times Performance Factor Percentage.
    The standard award percentages for officers are based on
    individual salary grade levels, which were increased slightly
    from 2009 plan percentages.

Payment of Annual Awards:

All annual awards
    for a performance year will be paid in cash no later than March
    15 of the calendar year following the performance year provided
    that they first have been reviewed and approved by the C&HR
    Committees, and provided further that the annual award for a
    particular performance year has not been deferred voluntarily.
    The amounts required by law to be withheld for income and
    employment taxes will be deducted from the annual award
    payments. All annual awards become the obligation of the company
    on whose payroll the employee is enrolled at the time the
    C&HR Committees make the annual award.
