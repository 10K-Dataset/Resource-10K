PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

CMS
    Energy

CMS Energy was formed in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy
    company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent
    holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an
    electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a
    domestic IPP. Consumers serves individuals and businesses
    operating in the alternative energy, automotive, chemical,
    metal, and food products industries, as well as a diversified
    group of other industries. CMS Enterprises, through its
    subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged primarily in IPP
    and owns power generation facilities fueled mostly by natural
    gas and biomass.

CMS Energy manages its businesses by the nature of services each
    provides and operates, principally in three business segments:
    electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises, its non-utility
    operations and investments. Consumers’ consolidated
    operations account for substantially all of CMS Energy’s
    total assets, income, and operating revenue. CMS Energy’s
    consolidated operating revenue was $6.4 billion in 2010,
    $6.2 billion in 2009, and $6.8 billion in 2008.

For further information about operating revenue, net operating
    income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to
    all of CMS Energy’s business segments and operations, see
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, CMS
    Energy’s Selected Financial Information, Consolidated
    Financial Statements, and Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Consumers

Consumers has served Michigan customers since 1886. Consumers
    was incorporated in Maine in 1910 and became a Michigan
    corporation in 1968. Consumers owns and operates electric
    distribution and generation facilities and gas transmission,
    storage, and distribution facilities. It provides electricity

and/or

natural gas to 6.8 million of Michigan’s
    10 million residents. Consumers’ rates and certain
    other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of
    the MPSC and FERC, as described in “CMS Energy and
    Consumers Regulation” in this Item 1.

Consumers’ consolidated operating revenue was
    $6.2 billion in 2010, $6.0 billion in 2009, and
    $6.4 billion in 2008. For further information about
    operating revenue, net operating income, and identifiable assets
    and liabilities attributable to Consumers’ electric and gas
    utility operations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data, Consumers’ Selected Financial
    Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consumers owns its principal properties in fee, except that most
    electric lines and gas mains are located below public roads or
    on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through
    easements and other rights. Almost all of Consumers’
    properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond
    Indenture. For additional information on Consumers’
    properties, see Consumers Electric Utility — Electric
    Utility Properties and Consumers Gas Utility — Gas
    Utility Properties in the “Business Segments” section
    of this Item 1.



In 2010, Consumers served 1.8 million electric customers
    and 1.7 million gas customers in Michigan’s Lower
    Peninsula. Presented in the following map is Consumers’
    service territory:



BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

Consumers
    Electric Utility

Electric Utility Operations:

Consumers’
    electric utility operations, which include the generation,
    purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated
    operating revenue of $3.8 billion in 2010,
    $3.4 billion in 2009, and $3.6 billion in 2008.
    Consumers’ electric utility customer base consists of a mix
    of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers
    in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. The automotive industry
    represented six percent of Consumers’ 2010 electric utility
    operating revenue. Presented in the following illustration is
    Consumers’ 2010 electric utility operating revenue of
    $3.8 billion by customer class:

Consumers’ electric utility operations are not dependent on
    a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any
    one or even a few of its largest customers is not reasonably
    likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’
    financial condition.

In 2010, Consumers’ electric deliveries, excluding
    intersystem deliveries, were 38 million MWh, which included
    ROA deliveries of four million MWh, consistent with the
    ten-percent cap. Net bundled sales were 34 million MWh in
    2010. In 2009, Consumers’ electric deliveries, excluding
    intersystem deliveries, were 36 million MWh, which included
    ROA deliveries of two million MWh, resulting in net bundled
    sales of 34 million MWh.

Consumers’ electric utility operations are seasonal. The
    consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer
    months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other
    cooling equipment.



Presented in the following illustration are Consumers’
    monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries
    adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers,
    including ROA deliveries, during 2010 and 2009:

Consumers’ 2010 summer peak demand was 8,190 MW, which
    includes ROA demand of 555 MW. For the

2009-2010

winter period, Consumers’ peak demand was 6,093 MW,
    which includes ROA demand of 425 MW. As required by MISO
    reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through
    long-term contracts, capacity necessary to supply its projected
    firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2011.

Weighted-average fuel costs

In 2010, Consumers’ four coal-fueled generating sites
    burned 10 million tons of coal and produced a combined
    total of 17,879 GWh of electricity, which represented
    48 percent of the energy provided by Consumers to meet
    customer demand.

In order to obtain its coal requirements, Consumers enters into
    physical coal supply contracts. At December 31, 2010,
    Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2013; these
    contracts total $315 million. All of Consumers’ coal
    supply contracts have fixed prices. At December 31, 2010,
    Consumers had 85 percent of its 2011 expected coal
    requirements under contract, as well as a

41-day

supply of coal on hand.

In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases
    a fleet of rail cars and has long-term transportation contracts
    with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for
    delivery of purchased coal to Consumers’ generating
    facilities. Consumers’ coal transportation contracts expire
    from 2011 through 2014; these contracts total $445 million.



Consumers participates in the Midwest Energy Market. Consumers
    offers its generation into the market on a day-ahead and
    real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the
    demand of its customers. Consumers is a net purchaser of power
    and supplements its generation capability with purchases from
    the market to meet its customers’ needs during peak demand
    periods.

At December 31, 2010, Consumers had unrecognized future
    commitments (amounts for which liabilities, in accordance with
    GAAP, have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase
    capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating
    plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based
    on the plants’ availability or deliverability. These
    payments for 2011 through 2030 total $15.3 billion and
    range from $822 million to $1 billion annually for
    each of the next five years. These amounts may vary depending on
    plant availability and fuel costs. For further information about
    Consumers’ future capacity and energy purchase obligations,
    see Item 7. MD&A, “Capital Resources and
    Liquidity.”

Consumers
    Gas Utility

Gas
    Utility Operations:

Consumers’ gas utility operations, which include the
    purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of
    natural gas, generated operating revenue of $2.4 billion in
    2010, $2.6 billion in 2009, and $2.8 billion in 2008.
    Consumers’ gas utility customer base consists of a mix of
    residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in
    Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following
    illustration is Consumers’ 2010 gas utility operating
    revenue by customer class:

Consumers’ gas utility operations are not dependent on a
    single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any
    one or even a few of its largest customers is not reasonably
    likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’
    financial condition.

In 2010, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system
    transportation deliveries, through Consumers’ pipeline and
    distribution network totaled 317 bcf, which included GCC
    deliveries of 36 bcf. In 2009, deliveries of natural gas,
    including off-system transportation deliveries, through
    Consumers’ pipeline and distribution network totaled 319
    bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 27 bcf. Consumers’
    gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers injects natural
    gas into storage during the summer months for use during the
    winter months when the demand for natural gas is higher. Peak
    demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the
    resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel. During 2010,
    46 percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers
    during the winter months



was supplied from storage. Presented in the following
    illustration are Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted gas
    deliveries to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during
    2010 and 2009:

Gas Utility Properties:

Consumers’ gas
    distribution and transmission system located in Michigan’s
    Lower Peninsula consists of:

•

26,585 miles of distribution mains;

•

1,664 miles of transmission lines;

•

seven compressor stations with a total of 150,475 installed and
    available horsepower; and

•

15 gas storage fields with an aggregate storage capacity of 307
    bcf and a working storage capacity of 142 bcf.

Gas Supply:

In 2010, Consumers purchased
    61 percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers
    and 21 percent from Canadian producers. The remaining
    18 percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and



delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program.
    Presented in the following illustration are the supply
    arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR
    customers during 2010:

Firm transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that
    define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame.
    Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR
    Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, L.P., Panhandle,
    Trunkline, and Vector Pipeline L.P. Under these contracts,
    Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate
    delivery to its customers. Consumers’ firm gas
    transportation contracts expire through 2017 and provide for the
    delivery of 71 percent of Consumers’ total gas supply
    requirements.

Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under
    firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under
    the GCC program. Consumers may also utilize incremental firm
    transportation contracts and interruptible transportation
    contracts to purchase its gas supply. Under interruptible
    transportation contracts, the transportation provider is
    permitted to interrupt service. Consumers’ use of
    incremental firm transportation contracts and interruptible
    transportation contracts is generally during off-peak summer
    months and after Consumers has fully utilized the services under
    the firm transportation contracts. The amount of interruptible
    transportation service and its use vary primarily with the price
    for this service and the availability and price of purchased and
    transported spot supplies.

Enterprises
    Segment — Non-Utility Operations and
    Investments

CMS Energy’s enterprises segment, through various
    subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged
    primarily in domestic IPP and the marketing of IPP. In 2007, the
    enterprises segment made a significant change in business
    strategy by exiting the international marketplace and refocusing
    on its independent power business in the U.S.

The enterprises segment’s operating revenue included in
    Income From Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements was $238 million in 2010,
    $216 million in 2009, and $365 million in 2008. The
    enterprises segment’s operating revenue included in Income
    (Loss) From Discontinued Operations in CMS Energy’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements was $10 million in 2010,
    $7 million in 2009, and $14 million in 2008.

IPP:

While owned by CMS Enterprises, CMS Generation
    invested in and operated non-utility power generation plants in
    the U.S. and abroad. In 2007, CMS Enterprises sold CMS
    Generation and all of CMS



Enterprises’ international assets to third parties and
    transferred its domestic independent power plant operations to
    its subsidiary, HYDRA-CO.

The operating revenue from IPP included in Income From
    Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements was $18 million in 2010,
    $18 million in 2009, and $22 million in 2008. The
    operating revenue from IPP included in Income (Loss) From
    Discontinued Operations in CMS Energy’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements was $10 million in 2010,
    $7 million in 2009, and $14 million in 2008.

IPP Properties:

At December 31, 2010, CMS
    Energy had ownership interests in independent power plants
    totaling 1,166 gross MW or 1,066 net MW. (Net MW
    reflects that portion of the gross capacity relating to CMS
    Energy’s ownership interests.)

    Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    Note 5, Contingencies and Commitments.

CMS Energy has recorded a significant liability for its
    affiliates’ obligations associated with Bay Harbor. For
    additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5, Contingencies
    and Commitments.

Air:

Consumers continues to install

state-of-the-art

emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants
    and to convert electric generating units to burn cleaner fuels.
    Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of
    $1.4 billion from 2011 through 2018 to comply with present
    and future federal and state regulations that will require
    extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides,
    particulate matter, and mercury emissions. Consumers’
    estimate may increase if additional laws or regulations are
    adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including
    carbon dioxide. For additional information concerning estimated
    capital expenditures related to emissions control, see
    Item 7. MD&A, Outlook, “Consumers’ Electric
    Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties — Electric
    Environmental Estimates.”

Solid Waste Disposal:

Costs related to the
    construction, operation, and closure of solid waste disposal
    facilities for coal ash are significant. Historically, Consumers
    has worked with others to reuse 30 to 40 percent of ash produced
    by its coal-fueled plants, and sells ash for use as a Portland
    cement replacement in concrete products, as feedstock for the
    manufacture of Portland cement, and for other
    environmentally-compatible uses. Consumers’ solid waste
    disposal areas are regulated under Michigan’s solid waste
    rules. Consumers has converted all of its fly ash handling
    systems to dry systems, which reduce landfill venting
    substantially. All of Consumers’ ash facilities have
    programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to
    quarterly MDNRE inspections. Furthermore, an independent
    consultant has assessed dike integrity and stability. No major
    deficiencies were identified that could immediately jeopardize
    continued safe and reliable operation of the project structures.
    The draft reports of three EPA contractors who have since
    inspected these facilities with regard to National Dam Safety
    Program Act requirements comport with this conclusion. The EPA
    has proposed new federal regulations for ash disposal areas.
    Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of
    $320 million from 2011 through 2018 to comply with future
    regulations relating to ash disposal. For additional information
    concerning estimated capital expenditures related to solid waste
    disposal, see Item 7. MD&A, Outlook,
    “Consumers’ Electric Utility Business Outlook and
    Uncertainties — Electric Environmental Estimates.”

Water:

Consumers uses significant amounts of water
    to operate and cool its electric generating plants. Water
    discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDNRE
    under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation,
    Consumers’ facilities have discharge monitoring programs.
    The EPA is developing new regulations related to cooling water
    intake systems. Consumers estimates that it will incur
    expenditures of $180 million from 2011 through 2018 to
    comply with future regulations relating to cooling water intake
    systems. For additional information concerning estimated capital
    expenditures related to cooling water intake systems, see
    Item 7. MD&A, Outlook, “Consumers’ Electric
    Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties — Electric
    Environmental Estimates.”

CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS COMPETITION

Electric
    Competition

Consumers’ electric utility business is subject to actual
    and potential competition from many sources, in both the
    wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation,
    electric delivery, and retail services.

The Customer Choice Act allows all of Consumers’ electric
    customers to buy electric generation service from Consumers or
    from an alternative electric supplier. The 2008 Energy
    Legislation revised the Customer Choice Act by limiting
    alternative electric supply to ten percent of weather-adjusted
    retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At
    December 31, 2010, electric deliveries under the ROA
    program were at the ten percent limit. Alternative electric
    suppliers were providing 807 MW of generation service to
    ROA customers.

Consumers also has competition or potential competition from:

•

industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their
    production capacity outside Consumers’ service territory
    for economic reasons;



•

municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery
    systems;

•

customer self-generation; and

•

adjacent utilities that extend lines to customers in contiguous
    service territories.

Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in
    adjacent areas and monitoring compliance with the MPSC’s
    and FERC’s rules, providing non-energy services, and
    providing tariff-based incentives that support economic
    development.

CMS ERM continues to focus on optimizing CMS Energy’s IPP
    portfolio. CMS Energy’s IPP business faces competition from
    generators, marketers and brokers, and utilities marketing power
    in the wholesale market.

Gas
    Competition

Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas
    utility business. Competition comes from other gas suppliers
    taking advantage of direct access to Consumers’ customers
    and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane,
    oil, and electricity.

INSURANCE

CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain
    insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in
    the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject
    to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not
    fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses. A
    portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or
    Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions
    that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS Energy or Consumers
    renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present
    insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on
    commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance
    markets.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ present insurance program
    does not cover the risks of certain environmental cleanup costs
    and environmental damages, such as claims for air pollution,
    damage to sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, and some
    long-term storage or disposal of wastes.

EMPLOYEES

CMS
    Energy

At December 31, 2010, CMS Energy and its wholly owned
    subsidiaries, including Consumers, had 7,822 full-time
    equivalent employees. Included in the total are
    3,310 full-time operating, maintenance, and construction
    employees and full-time and part-time call center employees who
    are represented by the Union.

Consumers

At December 31, 2010, Consumers and its subsidiaries had
    7,522 full-time equivalent employees. Included in the total
    are 3,310 full-time operating, maintenance, and
    construction employees and full-time and part-time call center
    employees who are represented by the Union.

ITEM 1A. RISK
    FACTORS

Actual results in future periods for CMS Energy and Consumers
    could differ materially from historical results and the
    forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors
    that might cause or contribute to these differences include, but
    are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections.
    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses are influenced
    by many factors that are difficult to predict, that involve
    uncertainties that may materially affect results, and that are
    often beyond their control. Additional risks and uncertainties
    not presently known or that the companies’ management
    believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the
    companies. The risk factors described in the following sections,
    as well as the other information included in this report and in
    other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered
    carefully before making an investment in securities of CMS
    Energy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk
    factors of CMS Energy. All of these risk factors are potentially
    significant.

CMS
    Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its
    debt service obligations.

Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on
    dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and
    other payment obligations. Restrictions contained in
    Consumers’ preferred stock provisions and other legal
    restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of
    incorporation and FERC requirements, limit Consumers’
    ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS
    Energy. At December 31, 2010, Consumers had
    $404 million of unrestricted retained earnings available to
    pay common stock dividends. If sufficient dividends are not paid
    to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy may not be able to
    generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations,
    which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s
    liquidity and financial condition.

CMS
    Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial
    flexibility and hence its ability to meet its debt service
    obligations.

At December 31, 2010, CMS Energy, including Consumers, had
    $7.2 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness,
    including $29 million of subordinated indebtedness relating
    to its convertible preferred securities. CMS Energy had
    $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness at
    December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, there were no
    borrowings and $3 million of letters of credit outstanding
    under CMS Energy’s revolving credit agreement. CMS Energy
    and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the
    future.

The level of CMS Energy’s present and future indebtedness
    could have several important effects on its future operations,
    including, among others:

•

a significant portion of CMS Energy’s cash flow from
    operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and
    interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for
    other purposes;

•

covenants contained in CMS Energy’s existing debt
    arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests,
    could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to,
    changes in its business;

•

CMS Energy’s ability to obtain additional financing for
    working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general
    corporate and other purposes could become limited;

•

CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its
    competitors that are less leveraged;

•

CMS Energy’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry
    conditions could increase; and

•

CMS Energy’s future credit ratings could fluctuate.

CMS Energy’s ability to meet its debt service obligations
    and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future
    performance, which will be subject to general economic
    conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory
    decisions (including with respect to environmental matters), and
    financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations,
    many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make
    assurances that its business will continue to generate
    sufficient cash flow from operations to service its
    indebtedness. If CMS Energy is unable to generate sufficient
    cash flows from operations, it may be required to sell assets or
    obtain additional financing. CMS Energy cannot ensure that
    additional financing will be available on commercially
    acceptable terms or at all.



CMS
    Energy cannot predict the outcome of regulatory reviews and
    claims regarding its participation in the development of Bay
    Harbor.

The EPA and the MDNRE have not completed their review of
    proposals by CMS Land and CMS Capital to remedy the flow of
    leachate from buried CKD piles at the Bay Harbor site to Lake
    Michigan and related environmental issues. One of the major
    issues to be resolved is determining a long-term solution to the
    disposal of leachate collected at the site. In December 2010,
    the MDNRE issued a five-year NPDES permit that authorizes CMS
    Land to discharge treated leachate into Little Traverse Bay.
    Costs to treat and discharge collected leachate under this
    permit could exceed those that are presently anticipated.
    Additionally, CMS Land and CMS Capital could be required to
    alter their present water disposal strategy upon expiration of
    this permit if the MDNRE or EPA identify a more suitable option,
    or if the permit itself is challenged before the MDNRE or the
    courts. CMS Land and CMS Capital, the MDNRE, the EPA, and other
    parties continue to negotiate the long-term remedy for the Bay
    Harbor site. These negotiations are focused on, among other
    things, issues related to:

•

the disposal of leachate;

•

the capping and excavation of CKD;

•

the location and design of collection lines and upstream water
    diversion systems;

•

application of criteria for various substances such as
    mercury; and

•

other matters that are likely to affect the scope of remedial
    work that CMS Land and CMS Capital may be obligated to undertake.

Depending on the results of these negotiations, as well as the
    size of any indemnity obligation or liability under an
    Administrative Order on Consent signed by CMS Land and CMS
    Capital or other liability under environmental laws, adverse
    outcomes of some or all of these matters could have a material
    adverse effect on CMS Energy’s liquidity and financial
    condition and could negatively affect CMS Energy’s
    financial results.

CMS
    Energy could be affected adversely by a regulatory investigation
    and civil lawsuits regarding pricing information that CMS MST
    and CMS Field Services provided to market
    publications.

In 2002, CMS Energy notified appropriate regulatory and
    governmental agencies that some employees at CMS MST and CMS
    Field Services appeared to have provided inaccurate information
    regarding natural gas trades to various energy industry
    publications which compile and report index prices. CMS Energy
    is cooperating with an ongoing investigation by the DOJ
    regarding this matter. CMS Energy is unable to predict the
    outcome of the DOJ investigation or the amount of any fines or
    penalties that may be imposed and what effect, if any, the
    investigation will have on CMS Energy.

CMS Energy, CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas,
    Inc., and Cantera Gas Company were named as defendants in
    various lawsuits arising as a result of alleged false natural
    gas price reporting. Allegations included manipulation of NYMEX
    natural gas futures and options prices, price-fixing
    conspiracies, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail
    prices in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.
    CMS Energy cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits or the
    amount of damages for which CMS Energy may be liable. It is
    possible that the outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could
    have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers retain contingent liabilities in connection
    with their asset sales.

The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the
    sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are
    required to:

•

retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes,
    pensions, or environmental conditions;

•

indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the
    inaccuracy of representations and warranties they make; and



•

make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of
    post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews,
    including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic
    governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions.

Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for
    extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending
    on the extent to which the buyers may ultimately seek to enforce
    their rights under these contractual provisions, and the
    resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a
    material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to
    obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. Potential
    disruption in the capital and credit markets could have a
    material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    businesses, including the availability and cost of short-term
    funds for liquidity requirements and their ability to meet
    long-term commitments. These consequences could have a material
    adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of
    operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands
    under commercial commitments, guarantees, indemnities, and
    letters of credit. Consumers’ capital requirements are
    expected to be substantial over the next several years as it
    implements generation and environmental projects, and those
    requirements may increase if additional laws or regulations are
    adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including
    carbon dioxide.

CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets,
    particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as on bank
    syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term
    liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ respective operations. CMS
    Energy and Consumers also use letters of credit issued under
    certain of their revolving credit facilities to support certain
    operations and investments.

Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a
    result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced
    alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions
    could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    access to liquidity needed for their respective businesses. Any
    disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take
    measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until
    alternative credit arrangements or other funding for their
    business needs can be arranged. These measures could include
    deferring capital expenditures, changing CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ commodity purchasing strategy to avoid
    collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating
    future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other
    discretionary uses of cash.

CMS Energy continues to explore financing opportunities to
    supplement its financial plan. These potential opportunities
    include refinancing

and/or

issuing new capital markets debt, preferred stock

and/or

common equity, and bank financing. Similarly, Consumers plans to
    seek funds through the capital markets, commercial lenders, and
    leasing arrangements. Entering into new financings is subject in
    part to capital market receptivity to utility industry
    securities in general and to CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ securities issuances in particular. CMS Energy
    and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets’
    acceptance of their securities or predict the impact of factors
    beyond their control, such as actions of rating agencies. If CMS
    Energy or Consumers is unable to obtain bank financing or access
    the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness, or is
    unable to obtain commercially reasonable terms for any
    financing, there could be a material adverse effect on its
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

Certain of CMS Energy’s securities and those of its
    affiliates, including Consumers, are rated by various credit
    rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of
    its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS
    Energy’s or Consumers’ ability to access capital on
    acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could
    make its cost of borrowing higher, and could cause CMS Energy or
    Consumers to reduce its capital expenditures. If it is unable to
    maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers may
    have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain of its
    suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers
    provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments
    affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit
    ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy’s credit
    ratings. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot



guarantee that any of their present ratings will remain in
    effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be
    lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers could incur additional significant costs to
    comply with environmental requirements.

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to
    costly and increasingly stringent environmental regulations.
    They believe that environmental laws and regulations related to
    flue gas emissions, ash disposal, and cooling water use will
    continue to become more stringent and require them to make
    additional significant capital expenditures for emissions
    control equipment installation and upgrades.

In 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment finding for greenhouse
    gases under the Clean Air Act. In this finding, which has been
    challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
    Circuit by numerous parties, the EPA determined that present and
    projected atmospheric concentrations of six greenhouse gases
    threaten the public health and welfare of present and future
    generations. In May 2010, the EPA issued a final rule that
    addresses greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under
    the Clean Air Act permitting programs. The “tailoring
    rule” sets thresholds for greenhouse gas emissions that
    define when permits under the NSR and Title V programs are
    required for new and existing industrial facilities. This
    regulation took effect in January 2011. Comprehensive federal
    legislation that addresses greenhouse gases has not advanced in
    the U.S. Congress. Federal legislation is considered likely
    to be enacted in some form in the future and could have a
    significant impact on the operation and cost of existing and
    future fossil-fueled power plants.

In 2010, a significant percentage of the energy generated by
    Consumers came from fossil-fueled power plants. The emissions
    from fossil-fueled power plants would be subject to greenhouse
    gas regulations. CMS Enterprises also has interests in
    fossil-fueled power plants and other types of power plants that
    produce greenhouse gases. Federal laws and rules limiting the
    emission of greenhouse gases or similar state laws and rules, if
    enacted, as well as international accords and treaties, could
    require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment
    for emission controls, purchase carbon emissions allowances,
    curtail operations, invest in non-fossil-fuel generating
    capacity, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the
    emission of greenhouse gases. The following risks related to
    climate change could also have a material adverse impact on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations:

•

litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy,
    Consumers, or their subsidiaries due to CMS Energy’s or
    Consumers’ greenhouse gas emissions;

•

impairment of CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ reputation
    due to its greenhouse gas emissions and public perception of its
    response to potential greenhouse gas regulations, rules, and
    legislation; and

•

extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms, that may
    affect customer demand, company operations, or assets.

The EPA is considering regulating CCBs, such as coal ash, as
    hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery
    Act. Michigan already regulates CCBs as low-hazard industrial
    waste. If coal ash is regulated as a hazardous waste, Consumers
    would likely cease the beneficial re-use of this product,
    resulting in significantly more coal ash requiring costly
    disposal. Additionally, it is possible that existing landfills
    could be closed if the upgrades to hazardous waste landfill
    standards are economically prohibitive. Costs associated with
    this potential regulation could be substantial.

The EPA is revising regulations that govern cooling water intake
    structures aimed at protecting aquatic life. Costs associated
    with these revisions could be material to CMS Energy, Consumers,
    and CMS Enterprises and result in operational changes or the
    retirement of certain generating units.

CMS Energy and Consumers expect to collect fully from their
    customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred
    to comply with environmental regulations. If Consumers were
    unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, it
    could negatively affect CMS Energy’s

and/or

Consumers’ liquidity, results of operations, and financial
    condition and CMS Energy

and/or

Consumers could be required to seek significant additional
    financing to fund these expenditures.



CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses could be affected
    adversely by any delay in meeting environmental
    requirements.

A delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or
    maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to
    satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or
    install emission control equipment could:

•

prevent the construction of new facilities;

•

prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing
    facilities;

•

prevent the modification of existing facilities; or

•

result in significant additional costs that could have a
    material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition,
    or results of operations.

Market
    performance and other changes could decrease the value of
    benefit plan assets, which then could require significant
    funding.

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of
    assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations
    under CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ pension and
    postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have
    significant obligations under these plans and hold significant
    assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market
    fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall
    below CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ forecasted return
    rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change
    in the level of interest rates used to measure the required
    minimum funding levels may increase the funding requirements of
    these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including
    increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy
    assumptions, may increase the funding requirements of the
    obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit
    plans. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to manage their
    pension and postretirement plan assets successfully, it could
    have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

Periodic
    reviews of the values of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    assets could result in accounting charges.

CMS Energy and Consumers are required by GAAP to review
    periodically the carrying value of their assets, including those
    that may be sold. Market conditions, the operational
    characteristics of their assets, and other factors could result
    in recording impairment charges for their assets, which could
    have an adverse effect on their stockholders’ equity and
    their access to additional financing. In addition, CMS Energy
    and Consumers may be required to record impairment charges at
    the time they sell assets, depending on the sale prices they are
    able to secure and other factors.

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses have safety
    risks.

Consumers’ electric and gas delivery systems, power plants,
    gas infrastructure, and energy products could be involved in
    accidents that result in injury or property loss to customers,
    employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have
    insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon
    the nature or severity of any incident or accident, CMS Energy
    or Consumers could suffer financial loss, damage to its
    reputation, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies
    or other public authorities.

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ revenues and results of
    operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control,
    including but not limited to natural disasters, terrorist
    attacks or related acts of war, hostile cyber intrusions, or
    other catastrophic events.

The impact of natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts, cyber
    intrusions, and other catastrophic events on the facilities and
    operations of CMS Energy and Consumers could have a material
    adverse affect on their liquidity, financial condition, and
    results of operations. A terrorist attack on physical
    infrastructure or a major natural disaster could result in
    severe damage to CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ assets
    beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies.
    Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information
    systems as well as electronic control systems used at the
    generating plants and for the electric and gas distribution
    systems, could severely disrupt



business operations and result in loss of service to customers,
    as well as significant expense to repair security breaches or
    system damage. Terrorist attacks or acts of war could result in
    the disruption of power and fuel markets that could increase
    costs or disrupt service. Instability in the financial markets
    as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, credit crises,
    recessions, or other factors, could have a material adverse
    effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational
    risks.

Consumers is actively engaged in multiple regulatory oversight
    processes and has a large electric and gas customer base. As a
    result, Consumers has a highly visible public profile in
    Michigan. Consumers and CMS Energy could suffer negative impacts
    to their reputations as a result of operational incidents,
    violations of corporate compliance policies, regulatory
    violations, or other events. This could have a material adverse
    effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations. It could also
    result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory
    oversight.

Energy
    risk management strategies may not be effective in managing fuel
    and electricity pricing risks, which could result in
    unanticipated liabilities to Consumers and CMS Energy or
    increased volatility of their earnings.

Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural
    gas, coal, electricity, emission allowances, and RECs. Prices
    for natural gas, coal, electricity, emission allowances, and
    RECs may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods
    of time and expose Consumers to commodity price risk. A
    substantial portion of Consumers’ operating expenses for
    its plants consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities.
    Consumers manages these risks using established policies and
    procedures, and it may use various contracts to manage these
    risks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts.
    No assurance can be made that these strategies will be
    successful in managing Consumers’ pricing risk or that they
    will not result in net liabilities to Consumers as a result of
    future volatility in these markets.

Natural gas prices in particular have been historically
    volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate
    exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and
    changes in commodity prices associated with its gas distribution
    business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the
    GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover
    prudently incurred costs associated with those positions.
    Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of its
    operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the
    ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends
    on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the
    commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers may not be able to
    execute its risk management strategies, which could result in
    greater unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To
    the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity
    prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of
    operations.

Changes
    in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying
    potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively
    impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of
    operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments
    regarding the potential tax effects of various financial
    transactions and results of operations in order to estimate
    their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations
    include income, real estate, sales and use taxes,
    employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these
    tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for
    potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have
    been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS

and/or

other
    taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues
    related to these reserves at CMS Energy or Consumers could have
    a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial condition,
    and results of operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws.
    Increases in local, state, or federal tax rates or other changes
    in tax laws could have adverse impacts on their liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations.



Consumers
    is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in
    its service territories.

Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are affected
    by the economic conditions of the customers they serve. In
    Consumers’ service territories in Michigan, the economy has
    been affected adversely by economic and financial instability in
    the automotive and real estate sectors and by relatively high
    unemployment. The Michigan economy also has been affected
    negatively by the uncertainty in the financial and credit
    markets. If economic conditions in Michigan decline further,
    Consumers may experience reduced demand for electricity or
    natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash
    flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers’
    service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable
    and levels of lost or stolen gas, which in turn impact its
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ energy sales and operations
    are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions
    from year to year.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses are seasonal.
    Demand for electricity is greater in the summer cooling season
    and the winter heating season. Demand for natural gas peaks in
    the winter heating season. Accordingly, their overall results in
    the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild
    temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating
    season could have a material adverse affect on CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results
    of operations.

Unplanned
    power plant outages could be costly for Consumers.

When unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or
    other equipment, Consumers may be required to incur unplanned
    expenses and to make spot market purchases of electricity that
    exceed its costs of generation. If Consumers were unable to
    recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a
    material adverse effect on Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

A work
    interruption or other union actions could adversely affect CMS
    Energy and Consumers.

Over 40 percent of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    employees are represented by a union. If these employees were to
    engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, or if the
    terms and conditions in future labor agreements were
    renegotiated, CMS Energy and Consumers could experience a
    significant disruption in their operations and higher ongoing
    labor costs.

Failure
    to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could
    harm CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of
    operations.

If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to
    future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and
    increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of
    resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development.
    Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of
    contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and
    safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees
    adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise
    could affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ ability to
    manage and operate their businesses. If CMS Energy and Consumers
    were unable to attract and retain an appropriately qualified
    workforce, their results of operations could be affected
    negatively.

Consumers
    may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal or natural
    gas, which could limit its ability to operate its electric
    generation facilities or serve its natural gas
    customers.

Consumers is dependent on coal for a significant portion of its
    electric generating capacity. While Consumers has coal supply
    and transportation contracts in place, there can be no assurance
    that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their
    obligations to supply coal to Consumers. The suppliers under the
    agreements may experience financial or operational problems that
    inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers.
    In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be
    required to supply coal to Consumers under certain
    circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If
    Consumers were unable to obtain its coal requirements under
    existing or future coal supply and transportation contracts, it
    may be required to purchase coal at higher



prices, or it may be forced to purchase electricity from higher
    cost generating resources in the Midwest Energy Market, which
    would increase Consumers’ working capital requirements.

Consumers has firm interstate transportation and supply
    agreements in place to facilitate deliveries of natural gas to
    its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies
    available to Consumers in the event of a counterparty’s
    failure to perform, there can be no assurances that the
    counterparties to these firm interstate transportation and
    supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to provide
    natural gas to Consumers. In addition, suppliers under these
    agreements may not be required to deliver natural gas to
    Consumers in certain circumstances, such as in the event of a
    natural disaster. If Consumers were unable to obtain its natural
    gas supply requirements under existing or future natural gas
    supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to
    purchase natural gas at higher prices from other sources or
    implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the
    MPSC, which would increase Consumers’ working capital
    requirements and decrease its natural gas revenues.

Electric
    industry regulation could have a material adverse effect on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.

Federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed
    dramatically in the last two decades and could continue to
    change over the next several years. These changes could have a
    material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by,
    extensive federal and state utility regulation. In CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ business planning and
    management of operations, they must address the effects of
    existing and proposed regulation on their businesses and changes
    in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by federal
    and state legislatures, regional transmission organizations,
    utility regulators, and taxing authorities. Adoption of new
    regulations by federal or state agencies, or changes to present
    regulations and interpretations of these regulations, could have
    a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of
    operations.

There are multiple proceedings pending before FERC involving
    transmission rates, regional transmission organizations, and
    electric bulk power markets and transmission. CMS Energy and
    Consumers cannot predict the impact of these electric industry
    restructuring proceedings on their liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

Electric
    industry legislation could have a material adverse effect on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.

The 2008 Energy Legislation, among other things, limits
    alternative electric supply to ten percent of weather-adjusted
    retail sales for the preceding calendar year for ROA. Proposals
    have been made to raise that limit, which, if enacted, could
    have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ business.
    Proposals also have been made to increase the electric sales
    volume that will be required from renewable energy sources.
    Other new legislation or interpretations could change how the
    businesses of CMS Energy and Consumers operate, impact the
    ability of Consumers to recover costs through rate increases, or
    require CMS Energy or Consumers to incur additional expenses.

The
    markets for alternative energy and distributed generation could
    impact financial results.

Advances in technology could reduce the cost of alternative
    methods of producing electricity, such as fuel cells,
    microturbines, windmills, and photovoltaic (solar) cells, to a
    level that is competitive with that of fossil-fuel technology
    utilized by CMS Energy and Consumers to produce a majority of
    their electricity. It is also possible that electric customers
    could reduce their electric consumption significantly through
    demand-side energy conservation programs. Changes in technology
    could also alter the channels through which electric customers
    buy electricity. Any of these changes could have a material
    adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.



CMS
    Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could
    have an adverse effect on financial results.

CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation.
    Electric and gas rates for their utilities are set by the MPSC
    and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. While
    Consumers is permitted by the 2008 Energy Legislation to
    self-implement rate changes six months after a rate filing with
    the MPSC, subject to certain limitations, if a final rate order
    from the MPSC provides for lower rates than Consumers
    self-implemented, Consumers must refund the difference, with
    interest. Also, the MPSC may delay or deny implementation of a
    rate increase upon showing of good cause.

In addition, Consumers’ plans for making significant
    capital investments, including modifications to meet new
    environmental requirements and investment in new generation,
    could be affected adversely or could have a material adverse
    effect on Consumers if rate regulators fail to provide timely
    rate relief. Regulators seeking to avoid or minimize rate
    increases could resist raising customer rates sufficiently to
    permit Consumers to recover the full cost of modifications to
    meet environmental requirements and other prudent investments.
    In addition, because certain costs are mandated by state
    requirements for cost recovery, such as resource additions to
    meet Michigan’s renewable resource standard, regulators
    could be more inclined to oppose rate increases for other
    required items and investments. Rate regulators could also face
    pressure to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of
    reasons, including failure of Michigan’s economy to improve
    or diminishment of Consumers’ customer base. In addition to
    potentially affecting Consumers’ investment program, any
    limitation of cost recovery through rates could have a material
    adverse effect on Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

A further regulatory risk could arise from the MPSC’s
    adoption of mechanisms to decouple revenues from electricity and
    gas sales. The MPSC’s adoption or future treatment of these
    mechanisms could impact future revenues.

FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell
    electricity at market-based rates. Failure of CMS Energy and
    Consumers to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a
    timely manner could have a material adverse effect on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation
    of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses, which
    include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or
    regulatory proceedings before either agency, could have a
    substantial negative effect on the companies’ investment
    plans and results of operations.

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ financial statements,
    including their reported earnings, could be significantly
    impacted by convergence with International Financial Reporting
    Standards.

The FASB is expected to make broad changes to GAAP as part of an
    overall initiative to converge U.S. standards with
    International Financial Reporting Standards. These changes could
    have significant impacts on the financial statements of CMS
    Energy and Consumers. Also, the SEC is considering incorporating
    International Financial Reporting Standards into the financial
    reporting system for U.S. registrants. A transition to
    International Financial Reporting Standards could significantly
    impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ financial results,
    since these standards differ from GAAP in many ways. One of the
    major differences is the lack of special accounting treatment
    for regulated activities under International Financial Reporting
    Standards, which could result in greater earnings volatility for
    CMS Energy and Consumers.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of those with
    whom they do business.

CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of
    counterparties with whom they do business. Adverse economic
    conditions or financial difficulties experienced by these
    counterparties could impair the ability of these counterparties
    to pay for CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ services or
    fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and
    payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these
    counterparties to remit payments and perform services timely.
    Any delay or default in payment or performance of contractual
    obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.



In recent years, the capital and credit markets have experienced
    unprecedented high levels of volatility and disruption. Market
    disruption and volatility could have a negative impact on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ lenders, suppliers, customers,
    and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their
    obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a
    negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMS Energy’s
    banking subsidiary, EnerBank.

CMS
    Energy could be required to pay cash to certain security holders
    in connection with the optional conversion of their convertible
    securities.

CMS Energy has issued two series of cash-convertible securities,
    of which an aggregate principal amount of $460 million was
    outstanding at December 31, 2010. If the trading price of
    CMS Energy’s common stock exceeds specified amounts at the
    end of a particular fiscal quarter, then holders of one or more
    series of these convertible securities will have the option to
    convert their securities in the following fiscal quarter, with
    the principal amount payable in cash by CMS Energy. Accordingly,
    if these trading price minimums are satisfied and security
    holders exercise their conversion rights, CMS Energy may be
    required to outlay a significant amount of cash to those
    security holders, which could have a material adverse effect on
    CMS Energy’s liquidity and financial condition.

There
    are risks associated with Consumers’ significant capital
    investment program planned for the next five
    years.

Consumers’ planned investments include an advanced metering
    infrastructure program, renewable power generation, gas
    compression, environmental controls, other electric and gas
    infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems, and, potentially,
    new power plants. The success of these investments depends on or
    could be affected by a variety of factors including, but not
    limited to, effective cost and schedule management during
    implementation, changes in commodity and other prices,
    operational performance, changes in environmental, legislative
    and regulatory requirements, and regulatory cost recovery.
    Consumers cannot predict the impact that any of these factors
    could have on the success of its capital investment program. It
    is possible that adverse events associated with these factors
    could have a material adverse effect on Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

    Company

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

This MD&A is a combined report of CMS Energy and Consumers.

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

CMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan.
    It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries,
    including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMS
    Enterprises, primarily a domestic IPP. Consumers’ electric
    utility operations include the generation, purchase,
    distribution, and sale of electricity, and Consumers’ gas
    utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage,
    distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers’ customer
    base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and
    diversified industrial customers. CMS Enterprises, through its
    subsidiaries and equity investments, owns and operates power
    generation facilities.

CMS Energy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature
    of services each provides. CMS Energy operates principally in
    three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and
    enterprises, its non-utility investments and operations.
    Consumers operates principally in two business segments:
    electric utility and gas utility.

CMS Energy and Consumers earn revenue and generate cash from
    operations by providing electric and natural gas utility
    services; electric distribution and generation; gas
    transmission, storage, and distribution; and other
    energy-related services. Their businesses are affected primarily
    by:

•

regulation and regulatory matters;

•

economic conditions;

•

weather;

•

energy commodity prices;

•

interest rates; and

•

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ securities’ credit
    ratings.

During the past several years, CMS Energy’s “Growing
    Forward” business strategy has emphasized the following key
    elements:

Utility
    Investment

Consumers expects to make capital investments of more than
    $6 billion over the next five years, with a key aspect of
    its strategy being the balanced energy initiative. The balanced
    energy initiative is a comprehensive energy resource plan to
    meet Consumers’ projected short-term and long-term electric
    power requirements with energy efficiency, demand management,
    expanded use of renewable energy, development of new power
    plants, pursuit of



additional PPAs to complement existing generating sources,
    potential retirement or mothballing of older generating units,
    and continued operation of others.

Presented in the following illustration are CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ estimated capital expenditures, including
    lease commitments, for 2011 through 2015:

Renewable energy projects are a major component of
    Consumers’ planned capital investments. Consumers expects
    to spend $650 million on renewable energy investments
    through 2015. The 2008 Energy Legislation requires that at least
    ten percent of Consumers’ electric sales volume come from
    renewable energy sources by 2015, and includes requirements for
    specific capacity additions. Consumers has historically included
    renewable resources as part of its portfolio, with about five
    percent of its present power supply coming from such renewable
    sources as hydroelectric, landfill gas, biomass, and wind. In
    2010, Consumers filed with the MPSC its first annual reports and
    reconciliations for its renewable energy plan and its energy
    optimization plan, requesting approval of 2009 plan costs. As
    one of the conditions to the continuation of the electric and
    gas decoupling mechanisms that were adopted in general rate
    cases, Consumers must exceed the statutory savings targets
    specified in the 2008 Energy Legislation for 2011 through 2014.
    In December 2010, the MPSC approved Consumers’ amended
    energy optimization plan to recover the additional spending
    necessary to exceed these savings targets.

In February 2011, Consumers and Detroit Edison together
    announced an $800 million maintenance and upgrade project
    at their jointly owned Ludington pumped-storage plant. The
    project, scheduled to begin in 2013 and extend through 2019,
    will increase the capacity of Ludington from its present level
    of 1,872 MW to about 2,172 MW. Consumers expects its
    share of the project cost to total $400 million.

Consumers’ smart grid program will also represent a
    significant capital investment. The initial deployment will
    include advanced metering infrastructure and will follow a
    phased approach, beginning in early 2012. Consumers expects to
    spend $355 million on its smart grid program through 2015.

In May 2010, Consumers announced plans to defer the development
    of its proposed

830-MW

coal-fueled plant at its Karn/Weadock generating complex. This
    decision reflects reduced customer demand for electricity
    resulting from the recession in Michigan, forecasted lower
    natural gas prices due to recent developments in shale gas
    recovery technology, and projected surplus generating capacity
    in the MISO market.



Regulation

Regulatory matters are a key aspect of CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ businesses, particularly Consumers’ rate
    cases and regulatory proceedings before the MPSC. Recent
    significant regulatory events and developments are summarized
    below.

•

Big Rock Decommissioning Refund:

In February 2010,
    the MPSC issued an order requiring that Consumers refund to
    customers $85 million collected during a rate freeze from
    2001 to 2003 plus interest. Consumers completed this refund in
    January 2011. Consumers has filed an appeal of this order.

•

2009 Gas Rate Case:

In May 2010, the MPSC issued a
    gas rate order authorizing Consumers to increase its gas rates
    in an annual amount of $66 million based on an authorized
    return on equity of 10.55 percent. This rate order also
    adopted a pilot revenue decoupling mechanism. In general, a
    decoupling mechanism allows a utility to adjust rates due to
    changes in sales volumes, in order to improve the match between
    the collection of revenues and the revenue level approved by the
    utility’s regulator. Consumers’ gas decoupling
    mechanism, subject to certain conditions, allows Consumers to
    adjust future gas rates to compensate for changes in sales
    volumes resulting from energy efficiency, conservation, and
    other non-weather factors. This mechanism is subject to review
    at the end of annual periods.

•

2010 Gas Rate Case:

In August 2010, Consumers filed
    an application with the MPSC seeking an annual gas rate increase
    of $55 million based on an 11 percent authorized
    return on equity. The filing requested recovery for investments
    made to enhance safety, system reliability, and operational
    efficiencies that improve service to customers. In January 2011,
    Consumers filed testimony and exhibits with the MPSC in support
    of a self-implemented annual gas rate increase of
    $48 million, subject to refund with interest. In February
    2011, Consumers filed a letter with the MPSC revising the
    proposed self-implemented increase to $29 million. The MPSC
    issued an order in February 2011, delaying Consumers’
    self-implementation in order to give other parties to the
    proceeding an opportunity to respond to Consumers’ revised
    self-implementation filing.

•

2010 Electric Rate Case:

In November 2010, the MPSC
    issued an electric rate order authorizing Consumers to increase
    its rates in an annual amount of $146 million based on an
    authorized return on equity of 10.7 percent. This electric
    rate order continues Consumers’ pilot electric decoupling
    mechanism, which, subject to certain conditions, was adopted in
    a November 2009 electric rate order. The electric decoupling
    mechanism is similar to the gas decoupling mechanism, but also
    permits rate adjustments to compensate for changes in sales
    volumes resulting from weather fluctuations. The mechanism is
    subject to review at the end of annual periods.

Environmental regulation is another area of importance for CMS
    Energy and Consumers. In 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment
    finding that greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide,
    contribute to air pollution that may endanger the public health
    and welfare, thus setting the stage for regulation of carbon
    dioxide emissions under the Clean Air Act. The EPA also issued
    an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in April 2010,
    indicating that it is considering a variety of regulatory
    actions with respect to PCBs. In June 2010, the EPA proposed a
    range of alternatives for regulating CCBs, such as coal ash,
    under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In July 2010,
    the EPA released CATR, a proposed rule that would replace CAIR.
    CMS Energy and Consumers are monitoring these developments for
    potential effects on their plans and operations.

Safety

The safety and security of employees, customers, and the general
    public remain a priority of CMS Energy and Consumers.
    Accordingly, CMS Energy and Consumers have worked to integrate a
    set of safety principles into their business operations and
    culture. These principles include complying with applicable
    safety, health, and security regulations and implementing
    programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and
    security conditions.



Financial
    Performance in 2010 and Beyond

In 2010, CMS Energy’s net income available to common
    stockholders was $324 million, and diluted earnings per
    share were $1.28. This compares with net income available to
    common stockholders of $218 million and diluted earnings
    per share of $0.91 in 2009.

Among the most significant factors contributing to CMS
    Energy’s improved performance in 2010 were benefits from
    electric and gas rate orders, the absence of a revenue reduction
    in 2009 associated with the Big Rock decommissioning refund
    order, increased deliveries of electricity, and an insurance
    settlement related to a previously sold investment.

Also in 2010, CMS Energy recognized a $40 million charge to
    increase the recorded liability for its affiliates’
    environmental remediation obligation associated with Bay Harbor.
    This increase was due to several factors, including anticipated
    cost increases for the disposal of leachate under an NPDES
    permit issued by the MDNRE; additional costs for the increased
    scope of remediation to meet EPA and MDNRE requirements; and
    increased legal, management, and engineering costs due to delays
    in reaching an agreement with all involved parties. In addition,
    Consumers recorded charges of $22 million in 2010 to write
    off previously capitalized development costs associated with its
    proposed coal-fueled plant. These charges reflected
    Consumers’ decision to defer the development of the plant,
    and the reduced likelihood that the plant will be constructed.

A more detailed discussion of the factors affecting CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ performance in 2010 can be
    found in the “Results of Operations” section that
    follows this Executive Overview.

In 2010, Consumers’ weather-adjusted electric deliveries
    increased by 1.7 percent over 2009, while Consumers’
    weather-adjusted gas deliveries were at similar levels to 2009.
    These trends support CMS Energy’s view that economic
    conditions in Michigan have stabilized. Although Michigan’s
    economy continues to be affected by the recession and its impact
    on the state’s automotive industry, by high unemployment
    rates, and by a modestly shrinking population, there are
    indications that the recession is easing in Michigan. Consumers
    expects its electric sales to increase by about 1.5 percent
    annually through 2016, driven largely by the continued rise in
    industrial production. Consumers is projecting that its gas
    sales will decline by about one percent annually through 2016,
    due largely to energy efficiency and conservation.

As Consumers continues to seek fair and timely regulatory
    treatment, delivering customer value will remain a key strategic
    priority. To keep costs down for its utility customers,
    Consumers has set aggressive goals for annual productivity
    improvements. Additionally, Consumers will strive to give
    priority to capital investments that increase customer value or
    lower costs.

Consumers expects to continue to have sufficient capacity to
    fund its investment-based growth plans. CMS Energy also expects
    its sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet its cash
    requirements. CMS Energy and Consumers will continue to monitor
    developments in the financial and credit markets, as well as
    government policy responses to those developments, for potential
    implications for their businesses and their future financial
    needs.

Electric deliveries and rate increases:

For 2010,
    electric delivery revenues increased $266 million compared
    with 2009. This variance included $84 million associated
    with favorable weather in 2010, offset partially by
    $40 million of decreased demand revenues and
    $19 million from lower customer usage. Additionally,
    revenues increased $32 million due to surcharges from MPSC
    orders allowing recovery of retirement benefit expenses, and
    $100 million from authorized rate increases in November
    2010 and November 2009. Revenues also increased $99 million
    due to the absence of a refund ordered in 2009 related to the
    Big Rock decommissioning case. For more details regarding the
    Big Rock decommissioning order, see Note 6, Regulatory
    Matters. Other miscellaneous revenue increases totaled
    $10 million. Overall, deliveries to end-use customers were
    37.7 billion kWh in 2010, an increase of 1.9 billion
    kWh or 5.3 percent compared with 2009.

For 2009, electric delivery revenues decreased $6 million
    compared with 2008. This variance resulted from $43 million
    associated with unfavorable weather in 2009, $10 million
    from lower customer usage,  and $99 million from a refund
    order related to the Big Rock decommissioning case, offset
    largely by $146 million of additional revenues from
    authorized rate increases in June 2008 and November 2009.
    Overall, deliveries to end-use customers were 35.8 billion
    kWh in 2009, a decrease of 1.7 billion kWh or
    4.5 percent compared with 2008.

Other income, net of expenses:

For 2010, other
    income decreased $27 million compared with 2009, due
    primarily to a reduction of $8 million in interest income
    recorded on regulatory assets and the absence, in 2010, of
    $9 million of gains recognized on land sales in 2009.

For 2009, other income increased $14 million compared with
    2008, due primarily to $9 million of gains recognized on
    land sales in 2009 and an $11 million impairment charge
    recorded on Consumers’ SERP investments in 2008.

Maintenance and other operating expenses:

For 2010,
    maintenance and other operating expenses increased
    $59 million compared with 2009. The increase was due
    primarily to higher retirement benefit expenses of
    $32 million and a $22 million impairment charge
    related to Consumers’ decision to defer the development of
    its proposed coal-fueled plant.

For 2009, maintenance and other operating expenses increased
    $77 million compared with 2008. The increase was due
    primarily to $24 million of higher plant maintenance
    expenses, $23 million related to energy optimization
    program costs, and higher benefit expenses of $7 million.
    In addition, expenses increased $35 million in 2009 due to
    sulfur dioxide credits and RCP savings on Consumers’ MCV
    PPA contract recorded in 2008.

Interest charges:

For 2010, interest charges
    decreased $23 million compared with 2009. The decrease was
    due to the absence, in 2010, of $31 million of interest
    expense associated with the 2009 Big Rock decommissioning order,
    offset partially by an $8 million increase in other
    interest charges in 2010.

For 2009, interest charges increased $42 million compared
    with 2008, due to higher interest expense of $31 million
    associated with the Big Rock decommissioning order and an
    $11 million increase in other interest charges.



Income taxes:

For 2010, income taxes increased
    $80 million compared with 2009, due to higher electric
    utility earnings. For 2009, income taxes decreased
    $47 million compared with 2008, due to lower electric
    utility earnings.

Gas deliveries and rate increases:

For 2010, gas
    delivery revenues increased $60 million compared with 2009,
    due primarily to additional revenues of $54 million from an
    authorized rate increase in May 2010. In addition, surcharge and
    other miscellaneous revenues increased $30 million. These
    increases were offset partially by a $24 million reduction
    due to unfavorable weather in 2010. Gas deliveries, including
    miscellaneous transportation to end-use customers, were 273.1
    bcf in 2010, a decrease of 11.2 bcf or 3.9 percent compared
    with 2009.

For 2009, gas delivery revenues increased $29 million
    compared with 2008, due to additional revenues of
    $32 million from an authorized rate increase in December
    2008 and a self-implemented rate increase in November 2009. In
    addition, surcharge and other miscellaneous revenues increased
    $28 million. These increases were offset by
    $10 million associated with unfavorable weather in 2009 and
    $21 million due to lower customer usage. Gas deliveries,
    including miscellaneous transportation to end-use customers,
    were 284.3 bcf in 2009, a decrease of 19.4 bcf or
    6.4 percent compared with 2008.

Other income, net of expenses:

Other income in 2010
    was not materially different from other income in 2009.

For 2009, other income increased $13 million compared with
    2008 due to $8 million of higher interest income on secured
    borrowing agreements and a $5 million impairment charge
    recorded on Consumers’ SERP investments in 2008.

Maintenance and other operating expenses:

For 2010,
    maintenance and other operating expenses increased
    $7 million compared with 2009 due primarily to energy
    optimization program costs.

For 2009, maintenance and other operating expenses increased
    $32 million compared with 2008, due primarily to
    $14 million related to energy optimization program costs
    and higher benefit expenses of $12 million.

Depreciation and amortization:

For 2010,
    depreciation and amortization expense increased $4 million
    compared with 2009, due primarily to increased plant in service.
    For 2009, depreciation and amortization expense decreased
    $18 million compared with 2008 due to the December 2008 gas
    rate order, which reduced depreciation expense.

Income taxes:

For 2010, income taxes increased
    $11 million compared with 2009, and for 2009, income taxes
    increased $12 million compared with 2008. Both increases
    were due to higher gas utility earnings.

For 2010, the enterprises segment reported net income of
    $36 million, compared with a net loss of $7 million
    for 2009. The $43 million change reflected income of
    $31 million from the settlement of an insurance claim
    related to a previously sold asset and a $9 million tax
    benefit related to the Michigan Business Tax. Additionally,
    income increased $6 million due to higher gas and power
    sales offset partially by increased maintenance and other
    operating expenses. These increases were offset by a
    $3 million decrease associated with Bay Harbor; in 2010,
    the enterprises segment recorded a $25 million after-tax
    increase in the environmental remediation liability associated
    with Bay Harbor, compared with a $22 million after-tax
    increase in 2009. For more details regarding Bay Harbor, see
    Note 5, Contingencies and Commitments.

For 2009, the enterprises segment reported a net loss of
    $7 million compared with net income of $13 million for
    2008. The $20 million change was due primarily to a
    $22 million after-tax increase in the environmental
    remediation liability associated with Bay Harbor.

For 2010, corporate interest and other net expenses increased
    $34 million compared with 2009, reflecting an
    $18 million gain recognized in 2009 on the early retirement
    of long-term debt — related parties and
    $15 million due primarily to higher tax expense in 2010
    related to the Michigan Business Tax. Additionally, interest
    expense increased $10 million due to higher debt levels at
    higher average interest rates. These items were offset partially
    by $9 million of higher net earnings at EnerBank and lower
    legal fees.

For 2009, corporate interest and other net expenses decreased
    $5 million, reflecting an $18 million gain on the
    early retirement of long-term debt — related parties,
    offset partially by $11 million in premiums paid on the
    early retirement of senior notes.

Discontinued
    Operations

For 2010, a loss of $23 million was recorded from
    discontinued operations, compared with income of
    $20 million for 2009. The $43 million change was due
    primarily to a $28 million gain recognized in 2009 on the
    expiration of an indemnity for a 2007 asset sale and
    $10 million of additional tax expense in 2010 resulting
    from an IRS audit adjustment related to a 2003 asset sale.

For 2009, income of $20 million was recorded from
    discontinued operations, compared with income of $1 million
    for 2008. The $19 million change was due primarily to a
    $28 million gain on the expiration of an indemnity for a
    2007 asset sale, offset partially by a loss of $8 million,
    reflecting operating results at Exeter.

    pension contributions.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash provided by
    operating activities at Consumers decreased $12 million
    compared with 2009. The decrease was due primarily to higher
    pension contributions and refunds to customers. These changes
    were offset largely by increased billings due to recent
    regulatory actions.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash provided by
    operating activities at CMS Energy increased $291 million
    compared with 2008. This increase was due primarily to the
    absence in 2009 of a payment made by CMS ERM in 2008 to
    terminate electricity sales agreements and the changes affecting
    Consumers’ cash provided by operating activities described
    in the following paragraph.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash provided by
    operating activities at Consumers increased $49 million
    compared with 2008. This increase was due primarily to the
    impact of lower gas prices on inventory purchased in 2009,
    increased billings due to recent regulatory actions, the
    absence, in 2009, of refunds to customers of excess Palisades
    decommissioning funds, and other timing differences. These
    changes were offset partially by the pension contribution of
    $199 million and lower sales of accounts receivable in 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash used in
    financing activities at CMS Energy increased by
    $182 million compared with 2008. The increase in net cash
    used in financing activities was due primarily to an increase in
    net debt retirements.



For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash used in
    financing activities at Consumers decreased $74 million
    compared with 2008. This decrease was due primarily to a
    stockholder’s contribution from CMS Energy, offset
    partially by a decrease in net proceeds from borrowings.

For additional details on long-term debt activity, see
    Note 7, Financings and Capitalization.

CAPITAL
    RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

CMS Energy uses dividends from its subsidiaries and external
    financing and capital transactions to invest in its utility and
    non-utility businesses, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its
    other obligations. The ability of CMS Energy’s
    subsidiaries, including Consumers, to pay dividends to CMS
    Energy depends upon each subsidiary’s revenues, earnings,
    cash needs, and other factors. In addition, Consumers’
    ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain terms included
    in its articles of incorporation, as well as by FERC
    requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2010,
    Consumers paid $358 million in common stock dividends to
    CMS Energy.

Consumers uses cash flows generated from operations and external
    financing transactions, as well as stockholder’s
    contributions from CMS Energy, to fund capital expenditures,
    retire debt, pay dividends, contribute to its employee benefit
    plans, and fund its other obligations.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ access to the financial
    and capital markets depends on their credit ratings and on
    market conditions. As evidenced by past financing transactions,
    CMS Energy and Consumers have had ready access to these markets
    and, barring major market dislocations or disruptions, they
    expect to continue to have such access. If access to these
    markets were to become diminished or otherwise restricted,
    however, CMS Energy and Consumers would implement contingency
    plans to address debt maturities, which could include reduced
    capital spending. CMS Energy and Consumers also have the
    following secured revolving credit facilities available:

CMS Energy and Consumers presently use these credit facilities
    to issue letters of credit, and they intend to renew these
    facilities at reasonable terms before their expiration. An
    additional source of liquidity is Consumers’ revolving
    accounts receivable sales program, which allows it to transfer
    up to $250 million of accounts receivable as a secured
    borrowing. At December 31, 2010, $250 million of
    account receivable were eligible for transfer under this program.

Certain of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ credit
    agreements and debt indentures contain covenants that require
    CMS Energy and Consumers to maintain certain financial ratios.
    CMS Energy’s $550 million revolving credit agreement
    specifies a maximum debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined therein,
    and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined therein. Also,
    certain of CMS Energy’s senior notes indenture supplements
    specify a minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined therein.
    Consumers’ revolving credit agreements specify a maximum
    debt to capital ratio, as defined therein. At December 31,
    2010, no events of default had occurred with respect to any debt
    covenants contained in CMS Energy and Consumers’ credit
    agreements or debt indentures. CMS Energy and Consumers were
    each in compliance with these limits as of December 31,

Components of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ cash
    management plan include controlling operating expenses and
    capital expenditures and evaluating market conditions for
    financing and refinancing opportunities. CMS Energy and
    Consumers believe that their present level of cash and their
    expected cash flows from operating activities, together with
    their access to sources of liquidity, will be sufficient to fund
    their contractual obligations for 2011 and beyond.

Contractual Obligations:

Presented in the following table
    are CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ contractual cash
    obligations for each of the periods presented. The table
    excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on CMS

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements:

CMS Energy,
    Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries also enter into
    various arrangements in the normal course of business to
    facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These
    arrangements include indemnities, surety bonds, letters of
    credit, and financial and performance guarantees. Indemnities
    are usually agreements to reimburse a counterparty that may
    incur losses due to outside claims or breach of contract terms.
    The maximum payment that could be required under a number of
    these indemnity obligations is not estimable. While CMS Energy
    and Consumers believe it is unlikely that they will incur any
    material losses related to indemnities they have not recorded as
    liabilities, they cannot predict the impact of these contingent
    obligations on their liquidity and financial condition. For
    additional details on these and other guarantee arrangements,
    see Note 5, Contingencies and Commitments,
    “Guarantees.”

Capital Expenditures:

Over the next five years, CMS
    Energy and Consumers expect to make capital investments of more
    than $6 billion. CMS Energy and Consumers may revise their
    forecasts of capital expenditures periodically due to a number
    of factors, including environmental regulations, business
    opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and the
    ability to access capital. Presented in the following table are
    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ estimated capital
    expenditures, including lease commitments, for 2011 through 2015:

Presented in the following illustration are the components of
    CMS Energy’s (including Consumers’) planned capital
    spending for 2011 through 2015:

OUTLOOK

Several business trends and uncertainties may affect CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ financial condition and
    results of operations. These trends and uncertainties could have
    a material impact on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position. For
    additional details regarding these and other uncertainties, see
    “Forward-Looking Statements and Information;”
    Note 5, Contingencies and Commitments; and Part I,
    Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Consumers’
    Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties

Balanced Energy Initiative:

Consumers’ balanced
    energy initiative is a comprehensive energy resource plan
    designed to meet its projected short-term and long-term electric
    power requirements through:

•

energy efficiency;

•

demand management;

•

expanded use of renewable energy;

•

development of new power plants;

•

pursuit of additional PPAs to complement existing generating
    sources;

•

continued operation of existing units; and

•

potential retirement or mothballing of older generating units.

In May 2010, Consumers announced plans to defer the development
    of its proposed 830 MW coal-fueled plant at its
    Karn/Weadock generating complex. This decision reflects reduced
    customer demand for electricity due to the recession, forecasted
    lower natural gas prices due to recent developments in shale gas
    recovery technology, and projected surplus generating capacity
    in the MISO market. Consumers has been monitoring customer
    demand, fuel and power prices, and other market conditions, and
    has not set a timetable for a future decision about the project;
    however, the likelihood that the plant will be constructed has
    diminished significantly. Consumers’ alternatives to



constructing the proposed coal-fueled plant include constructing
    new gas-fueled generation, relying on additional market
    purchases, as well as continued operation of several existing
    generating units.

Renewable Energy Plan:

Consumers’ renewable
    energy plan details how Consumers will meet REC and capacity
    standards prescribed by the 2008 Energy Legislation. This
    legislation requires Consumers to obtain RECs in an amount equal
    to at least ten percent of its electric sales volume (estimated
    to be 3.6 million RECs annually) by 2015. RECs represent
    proof that the associated electricity was generated from a
    renewable energy resource. The legislation also requires
    Consumers to obtain 500 MW of capacity from renewable
    energy resources by 2015, either through generation resources
    owned by Consumers or through agreements to purchase capacity
    from other parties.

Under its renewable energy plan, Consumers expects to secure its
    required RECs each year with a combination of newly generated
    RECs and previously generated RECs carried over from prior
    years. Presently, Consumers generates or purchases
    1.6 million RECs per year, which represents 44 percent
    of the 2015 renewable energy requirement. In 2010, Consumers
    contracted for the purchase of 900,000 RECs per year, which
    represents an additional 25 percent of the 2015 renewable
    energy requirement. In addition, at December 2010, Consumers
    held three million RECs in inventory for use over the next
    15 years beginning in 2015. This inventory will provide
    200,000 RECs per year, or 5.5 percent of the 2015 renewable
    energy requirement.

To meet its renewable capacity requirements, Consumers expects
    to add more than 500 MW of owned or contracted renewable
    capacity by 2015. Through December 2010, Consumers has
    contracted for the purchase of 296 MW of nameplate capacity
    from renewable energy suppliers, which represents
    59 percent of the 2015 renewable capacity requirement.

Consumers has secured more than 79,000 acres of land
    easements in Michigan’s Huron, Mason, and Tuscola Counties
    for the potential development of wind generation, and is
    presently collecting wind speed and other meteorological data at
    those sites. Consumers has entered into construction and supply
    contracts as well as a contract to purchase wind turbine
    generators for the construction of a

100-MW

wind
    farm in Mason County, the Lake Winds Energy Park, which
    Consumers expects to be operational in late 2012. Consumers will
    continue to seek opportunities for wind generation development
    in support of the renewable capacity standards.

Electric Customer Deliveries and
    Revenue:

Consumers’ electric customer deliveries
    are largely dependent on Michigan’s economy, which has
    suffered from economic and financial instability in the
    automotive and real estate sectors.

Consumers expects weather-adjusted electric deliveries to
    increase in 2011 by two percent compared with 2010.
    Consumers’ outlook for 2011 includes continuing growth in
    deliveries to its largest customer, which produces
    energy-related and computer components. Consumers has a
    long-term contract with this customer to provide electricity at
    a discounted rate for economic development purposes. Excluding
    this customer’s growth, Consumers expects weather-adjusted
    electric deliveries in 2011 to be at a similar level to 2010.
    Consumers’ outlook reflects the impact of reduced
    deliveries associated with its investment in energy efficiency
    programs prescribed by the 2008 Energy Legislation, as well as
    recent projections of Michigan’s economic conditions.

Consumers believes economic conditions have stabilized.
    Consumers’ present outlook for electric delivery growth is
    about 1.5 percent annually on average through 2016. This
    reflects growth in electric deliveries offset by the predicted
    effects of energy efficiency programs and appliance efficiency
    standards. Actual deliveries will depend on:

•

energy conservation measures and results of energy efficiency
    programs;

•

fluctuations in weather; and

•

changes in economic conditions, including utilization and
    expansion or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population
    trends, and housing activity.

A decoupling mechanism, authorized by the MPSC in
    Consumers’ 2009 electric rate case order and extended in
    the 2010 electric rate case order, allows Consumers to adjust
    future electric rates to compensate for changes in sales volumes
    resulting from weather fluctuations, energy efficiency, and
    conservation. Consumers expects this mechanism to reduce
    volatility of electric utility revenue.



Electric ROA:

The Customer Choice Act allows all of
    Consumers’ electric customers to buy electric generation
    service from Consumers or from an alternative electric supplier.
    The 2008 Energy Legislation revised the Customer Choice Act by
    limiting alternative electric supply to ten percent of
    Consumers’ weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding
    calendar year. At December 31, 2010, electric deliveries
    under the ROA program were at the ten percent limit and
    alternative electric suppliers were providing 807 MW of
    generation service to ROA customers. Based on 2010
    weather-adjusted retail sales, Consumers expects 2011 electric
    deliveries under the ROA program to be at a similar level to
    2010.

In May 2010, a bill was introduced to the Michigan Senate and
    House of Representatives that would increase from ten percent to
    25 percent the proportion of an electric utility’s
    sales for which service may be provided by an alternative
    electric supplier. The 2010 legislative session ended without
    any definitive action being taken on this bill.

Electric Environmental Estimates:

Consumers’
    operations are subject to various state and federal
    environmental laws and regulations. Consumers continues to focus
    on complying with the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and
    numerous state and federal environmental regulations. Consumers
    estimates that it will incur expenditures of $1.9 billion
    from 2011 through 2018 to comply with these regulations.
    Consumers expects to recover these costs in customer rates, but
    cannot guarantee this result. Consumers’ primary
    environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to,
    the following matters:

Clean Air Interstate Rule/Clean Air Transport
    Rule:

Due to a December 2008 court decision that
    remanded CAIR back to the EPA, CAIR remains in effect at this
    time, pending the EPA’s finalization of a new rule. In July
    2010, the EPA released CATR, a proposed rule that would replace
    CAIR. Consumers is evaluating this proposed rule. If adopted in
    its present form, CATR could result in additional or accelerated
    environmental compliance costs related to Consumers’
    fossil-fueled power plants and retirement of some or all of the
    older, smaller generating units in Consumers’ fleet.
    Presently, Consumers’ strategy to comply with CAIR involves
    the installation of

state-of-the-art

emission control equipment.

Federal Hazardous Air Pollutant Regulation:

The EPA
    is developing Maximum Achievable Control Technology emission
    standards for electric generating units, based on
    Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. Consumers is unable to
    predict the impact of this proposed regulation, but expects to
    have a better understanding of the potential impact upon the
    release a proposed rule, which is expected in March 2011.
    Existing sources must meet the standards generally within three
    years of issuance of the final rule. The final rule is expected
    to be issued in November 2011.

Greenhouse Gases:

There are numerous legislative and
    regulatory initiatives at the state, regional, and national
    levels that involve the regulation of greenhouse gases.
    Consumers monitors and comments on these initiatives and also
    follows litigation involving greenhouse gases. Consumers
    believes Congress may eventually pass greenhouse gas
    legislation, but is unable to predict the form and timing of any
    final legislation.

In May 2010, the EPA released its Prevention of Significant
    Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule.
    The final rule, which numerous parties have challenged in the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, sets limits for
    greenhouse gas emissions that define when permits are required
    for new and existing industrial facilities under NSR PSD and
    Title V Operating Permit programs. Consumers does not
    expect that this regulation will require it to incur significant
    expenditures for efficiency upgrades for modified or new
    facilities at this time.

Litigation, as well as federal laws, EPA regulations regarding
    greenhouse gases, or similar treaties, state laws, or rules, if
    enacted, could require Consumers to replace equipment, install
    additional equipment for emission controls, purchase emission
    allowances, curtail operations, arrange for alternative sources
    of supply, or take other steps to manage or lower the emission
    of greenhouse gases. Although associated capital or operating
    costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could
    be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers
    expects to recover these costs and capital expenditures in rates
    consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of
    complying with environmental laws and regulations.

In 2010, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fueled power
    plants owned by Consumers, excluding the portion of Campbell
    Unit 3 that is owned by others, exceeded 18 million metric
    tons. During the same period, coal-fueled plants owned by the
    enterprises segment emitted about 700,000 metric tons of carbon
    dioxide.



Coal Combustion By-Products:

In June 2010, the EPA
    proposed rules regulating CCBs, such as coal ash, under the
    Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Michigan already
    regulates CCBs as low-hazard industrial waste. The EPA proposed
    a range of alternatives for regulating CCBs, including
    regulation as either a non-hazardous waste or a hazardous waste.
    If coal ash were regulated as a hazardous waste, Consumers would
    likely cease the beneficial re-use of this product, resulting in
    significantly more coal ash requiring costly disposal.
    Additionally, it is possible that existing coal ash disposal
    areas could be closed and costly alternative arrangements for
    coal ash disposal could be required if the upgrades to hazardous
    waste landfill standards are economically prohibitive. Consumers
    is unable to predict accurately the full impacts from this wide
    range of possible outcomes, but significant expenditures are
    likely.

Water:

In 2004, the EPA issued rules that govern
    existing electric generating plant cooling water intake systems.
    These rules require a significant reduction in the number of
    fish harmed by cooling water intake structures at existing power
    plants. The EPA compliance options in the rule were challenged
    before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
    which remanded the bulk of the rule back to the EPA for
    reconsideration in 2007. In April 2009, the U.S. Supreme
    Court ruled in favor of the utility industry’s position
    that the EPA can rely on a cost-benefit analysis in setting the
    national performance standards for fish protection. The EPA is
    scheduled to issue a draft rule in the first half of 2011 and a
    final rule in 2012.

Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on PCBs:

In
    April 2010, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed
    Rulemaking, indicating that it is considering a variety of
    regulatory actions with respect to PCBs. One proposal aims to
    phase out equipment containing PCBs by 2025. Another proposal
    eliminates an exemption for small equipment containing PCBs.
    Consumers could incur substantial costs associated with the
    regulation of PCBs due to prior installation of electrical
    equipment potentially containing PCBs.

Other electric environmental matters could have a major impact
    on Consumers’ outlook. For additional details on other
    electric environmental matters, see Note 5, Contingencies
    and Commitments, “Consumers’ Electric Utility
    Contingencies — Electric Environmental Matters.”

Electric Transmission:

In June 2010, FERC issued a
    Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to establish a closer link between
    regional electric transmission planning and cost allocations to
    ensure the construction of required transmission facilities. In
    a related matter, MISO filed a tariff revision with FERC in July
    2010, proposing a cost allocation methodology for a new category
    of transmission projects. In December 2010, FERC approved
    MISO’s cost allocation proposal. Under this tariff
    revision, the cost of these new transmission projects will be
    spread proportionally across the Midwest Energy Market.
    Consumers believes that Michigan customers will bear additional
    costs under MISO’s tariff without receiving comparable
    benefits from these projects. In January 2011, Consumers, along
    with the Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, Detroit Edison, the
    Michigan Municipal Electric Association, and the Michigan Public
    Power Agency, filed a protest and request for rehearing with
    FERC, opposing the allocation methodology in the MISO tariff
    revision. Consumers expects to continue to recover transmission
    expenses, including those associated with the MISO tariff
    revision, through the PSCR process.

Electric Rate Matters:

Rate matters are critical to
    Consumers’ electric utility business. For details on
    Consumers’ electric rate cases, PSCR, electric operation
    and maintenance expenditures show-cause order, electric
    depreciation cases, renewable energy plan, and energy
    optimization plan, see Note 6, Regulatory Matters,
    “Consumers’ Electric Utility.”

Consumers’
    Gas Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties

Gas Deliveries:

Consumers expects 2011
    weather-adjusted gas deliveries to decline by one percent
    compared with 2010, due to continuing conservation and overall
    economic conditions in Michigan. In addition, Consumers expects
    weather-adjusted gas deliveries to decline an average of one
    percent annually from 2012 through 2016, which includes expected
    effects of energy efficiency programs and continued
    conservation. Actual delivery levels from year to year may vary
    from this trend due to:

•

fluctuations in weather;

•

use by IPPs;



•

availability and development of renewable energy sources;

•

changes in gas prices;

•

Michigan economic conditions, including population trends and
    housing activity;

•

the price of competing energy sources or fuels; and

•

energy efficiency and conservation.

A decoupling mechanism, authorized by the MPSC in
    Consumers’ 2009 gas rate case order, allows Consumers to
    adjust future gas rates to compensate for changes in sales
    volumes by class arising from the difference between the level
    of average sales per customer adopted in the order and actual
    average weather-adjusted sales per customer. The mechanism will
    not provide rate adjustments for changes in sales volumes
    arising from weather fluctuations. Consumers expects this
    mechanism to mitigate the impacts of energy efficiency programs,
    conservation, and changes in economic conditions on its gas
    revenue.

Gas Pipeline Safety:

In September 2010, the
    U.S. House of Representatives passed the Corporate
    Liability and Emergency Accident Notification Act, which would
    require oil and natural gas pipeline operators to notify
    regulators within one hour following the discovery of certain
    oil spills or natural gas leaks. The bill also would increase
    civil fines for delayed reporting of oil spills and natural gas
    leaks and would establish an online database of safety
    violations searchable by pipeline owner or operator.

In response to the natural gas pipeline explosion that occurred
    in San Bruno, California in September 2010, the
    U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate have
    proposed bills stipulating stricter regulation of natural gas
    pipelines nationwide. These proposed bills affect primarily
    transmission pipelines and contain provisions mandating:

•

the use of internal inspection devices or comparable methods
    effective in detecting pipeline deterioration;

•

the installation of automatic shutoff equipment in
    high-consequence areas; and

•

certain disclosures to homeowners and regulatory agencies.

Consumers continues to comply with laws and regulations
    governing natural gas pipeline safety. If these proposed laws
    are put into effect, Consumers could incur significant
    additional costs related to its natural gas pipeline safety
    programs. Consumers expects that it would be able to recover the
    costs in rates, consistent with the recovery of other reasonable
    costs of complying with laws and regulations.

Gas Environmental Estimates:

Consumers expects to
    incur response activity costs at a number of sites, including 23
    former MGP sites. For additional details, see Note 5,
    Contingencies and Commitments, “Consumers’ Gas Utility
    Contingencies — Gas Environmental Matters.”

The Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule requires
    facilities engaging in the distribution of natural gas to
    collect data on greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the
    combustion of natural gas. In 2010, Consumers estimated that
    carbon dioxide emissions from its customers were 15 million
    metric tons.

Gas Rate Matters:

Rate matters are critical to
    Consumers’ gas utility business. For details on
    Consumers’ gas rate cases and GCR, see Note 6,
    Regulatory Matters, “Consumers’ Gas Utility.”

Consumers’
    Other Outlook and Uncertainties

Smart Grid:

Consumers’ grid modernization
    effort continues to move forward. The foundation of this effort
    is the installation of advanced metering and the infrastructure
    to support it. The installation will include smart meters that
    are capable of transmitting and receiving data, a two-way
    communications network, and modifications to Consumers’
    existing information technology systems to manage the data and
    enable changes to key business processes. It is intended to
    allow customers to monitor and manage their energy usage and
    help reduce demand during critical peak times, resulting in
    lower peak capacity requirements. Due to this system’s
    complexity and relative market immaturity, Consumers intends to
    continue its phased implementation approach. Consumers has
    concluded the testing and assessment phase of the project and
    will begin full deployment of meters in early 2012.



Enterprises
    Outlook and Uncertainties

The primary focus with respect to CMS Energy’s remaining
    non-utility businesses is to optimize cash flow and maximize the
    value of their assets.

Trends, uncertainties, and other matters that could have a
    material impact on CMS Energy’s consolidated income, cash
    flows, or financial position include:

•

indemnity and environmental remediation obligations at Bay
    Harbor;

•

the outcome of certain legal proceedings;

•

impacts of declines in electricity prices on the profitability
    of the enterprises segment’s generating units;

•

representations, warranties, and indemnities provided by CMS
    Energy or its subsidiaries in connection with previous sales of
    assets;

•

changes in commodity prices and interest rates on certain
    derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting
    and must be marked to market through earnings;

•

changes in various environmental laws, regulations, principles,
    practices, or in their interpretation; and

•

economic conditions in Michigan, including population trends and
    housing activity.

For additional details regarding the enterprises segment’s
    uncertainties, see Note 5, Contingencies and Commitments.

Other
    Outlook and Uncertainties

Litigation:

CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain of
    their subsidiaries are named as parties in various litigation
    matters, as well as in administrative proceedings before various
    courts and governmental agencies, arising in the ordinary course
    of business. For additional details regarding these and other
    legal matters, see Note 5, Contingencies and Commitments
    and Note 6, Regulatory Matters.

EnerBank:

EnerBank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CMS
    Capital that represents one percent of CMS Energy’s net
    assets and three percent of CMS Energy’s Net Income
    Available to Common Stockholders, is a Utah state-chartered,
    FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured home
    improvement loans. The carrying value of EnerBank’s loan
    portfolio was $385 million at December 31, 2010. Its
    loan portfolio was funded primarily by deposit liabilities of
    $363 million. Twelve-month rolling average default rates on
    loans held by EnerBank have declined from 2.1 percent at
    December 31, 2009 to 1.4 percent at December 31,
    2010. EnerBank expects the rate of loan defaults to decline
    further, and to level out at about 1.0 percent. CMS Energy
    is required to ensure that EnerBank remains well capitalized.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following accounting policies and related information are
    important to an understanding of CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ results of operations and financial condition
    and should be considered an integral part of their MD&A.
    For additional accounting policies, see Note 1, Significant
    Accounting Policies.

Use
    of Estimates and Assumptions

In the preparation of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    Consolidated Financial Statements, estimates and assumptions are
    used that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. CMS
    Energy and Consumers use accounting estimates for asset
    valuations, unbilled revenue, depreciation, amortization,
    financial and derivative instruments, employee benefits, the
    effects of regulation, indemnities, and contingencies. Actual
    results may differ from estimated results due to changes in the
    regulatory environment, regulatory decisions, lawsuits,
    competition, and other factors. CMS Energy and Consumers
    consider all relevant factors in making these assessments.

Fair Value Measurements:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    have assets and liabilities that are accounted for or disclosed
    at fair value. Fair value measurements incorporate assumptions
    that market participants would use in



pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
    Development of these assumptions may require significant
    judgment. For a detailed discussion of the valuation techniques
    and inputs used to calculate fair value measurements, see
    Note 4, Fair Value Measurements. Details about the fair
    value measurements for the Pension Plan and OPEB plan assets are
    included in Note 11, Retirement Benefits.

Income Taxes:

The amount of income taxes paid by CMS
    Energy is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and
    foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed
    assessments. An estimate of the potential outcome of any
    uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMS Energy believes
    adequate reserves have been provided for these exposures;
    however, future results may include favorable or unfavorable
    adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the
    assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation
    on potential assessments expire. Additionally, CMS Energy’s
    judgment as to the ability to recover its deferred tax assets
    may change. CMS Energy believes the valuation allowances related
    to its deferred tax assets are adequate, but future results may
    include favorable or unfavorable adjustments. As a result, CMS
    Energy’s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly
    over time.

Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments:

CMS
    Energy and Consumers assess the recoverability of their
    long-lived assets and equity method investments by performing
    impairment tests if certain triggering events occur or if there
    has been a decline in value that may be other than temporary.
    CMS Energy and Consumers base their evaluations of impairment on
    such indicators as:

•

the nature of the assets;

•

projected future economic benefits;

•

regulatory and political environments;

•

historical and future cash flow and profitability
    measurements; and

•

other external market conditions and factors.

The estimates CMS Energy and Consumers use may change over time,
    which could have a material impact on their Consolidated
    Financial Statements. For additional details, see Note 20,
    Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations, and Impairment Charges.

Unbilled Revenues:

CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ customers are billed monthly in cycles having
    billing dates that do not generally coincide with the end of a
    calendar month. This results in customers having received
    electricity or gas that they have not been billed for as of the
    month-end. Consumers estimates its unbilled revenues by applying
    an average billed rate to total unbilled deliveries for each
    customer class. Unbilled revenues, which are recorded as
    Accounts receivable on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $439 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $477 million at
    December 31, 2009.

Accounting
    for the Effects of Industry Regulation

Because Consumers has regulated operations, it uses regulatory
    accounting to recognize the effects of the regulators’
    decisions on its financial statements. Consumers continually
    assesses whether future recovery of its regulatory assets is
    probable by considering communications and experience with its
    regulators and changes in the regulatory environment. If
    Consumers determined that recovery of a regulatory asset were
    not probable, Consumers would be required to write off the asset
    and immediately recognize the expense to earnings.

Under electric and gas rate orders issued by the MPSC in 2009
    and 2010, Consumers was granted authority to implement revenue
    decoupling mechanisms. The electric decoupling mechanism adjusts
    customer rates to collect or refund the change in marginal
    revenue arising from the difference between the level of average
    sales per customer adopted in the electric rate order and actual
    average sales per customer. The gas decoupling mechanism is
    similar, but does not adjust customer rates for changes in sales
    volumes resulting from weather fluctuations. Consumers accounts
    for these programs as alternative-revenue programs that meet the
    criteria for recognizing the effects of decoupling adjustments
    on revenue as electricity and gas are delivered.

Unless prohibited by the MPSC upon a showing of good cause,
    Consumers is allowed to self-implement new energy rates six
    months after a new rate case filing; however, the rates that
    Consumers self-implements may be



subject to refund, with interest. Consumers recognizes revenue
    associated with self-implemented rates. If Consumers considers
    it probable that it will be required to refund a portion of its
    self-implemented rates, it records a provision for revenue
    subject to refund. A final rate order could differ materially
    from Consumers’ estimates underlying its self-implemented
    rates, giving rise to accounting adjustments. Under accounting
    rules for prior period adjustments, CMS Energy and Consumers may
    need to record such differences, if they are specifically
    identifiable to prior interim periods, as revisions to those
    periods.

For additional details, see Note 6, Regulatory Matters.

Financial
    and Derivative Instruments and Market Risk Information

Financial Instruments:

Debt and equity securities
    classified as available for sale are reported at fair value as
    determined from quoted market prices or other observable,
    market-based inputs. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from
    changes in fair value of the equity securities are reported, net
    of tax, in equity as part of AOCI, except that unrealized losses
    determined to be other than temporary are reported in earnings.
    Unrealized gains resulting from changes in fair value of the
    debt securities are reported, net of tax, in equity as part of
    AOCI. Unrealized losses on the debt securities, if significant,
    are considered other than temporary and reported in earnings
    since these securities are managed by an independent investment
    manager that can sell the securities at its own discretion.

Derivative Instruments:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    account for certain contracts as derivative instruments. The
    criteria used to determine if an instrument qualifies for
    derivative accounting are complex and often require significant
    judgment in application. If a contract is a derivative and does
    not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, it is
    recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value.
    Each quarter, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to
    reflect any change in the fair value of the contract. For
    additional details on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    derivatives, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments.

CMS Energy and Consumers generally use information from external
    sources, such as quoted market prices and other valuation
    information to determine the fair value of their derivatives.
    For certain contracts, this information is not available and
    mathematical models are used to value the derivatives. The most
    material of CMS Energy’s derivative liabilities, an
    electricity sales agreement held by CMS ERM, extends beyond the
    term for which quoted electricity prices are available. Thus, to
    value this derivative, CMS Energy uses a valuation model that
    incorporates a proprietary forward pricing curve for electricity
    based on forward natural gas prices and an implied heat rate.
    The model incorporates discounting, credit, and modeling risks.
    The model is sensitive to electricity and natural gas forward
    prices, and the fair value of this derivative liability will
    increase as these forward prices increase. The model is adjusted
    each quarter to incorporate market data as it becomes available.

The fair values calculated for CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ derivatives may change significantly as
    commodity prices and volatilities change. The cash returns
    actually realized on derivatives may be different from their
    estimated fair values. For derivatives in an asset position,
    calculations of fair value include reserves of less than
    $1 million to reflect the credit risk of CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ counterparties. For derivatives in a
    liability position, calculations include reserves of less than
    $1 million to reflect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    own credit risk. For additional details on how the fair values
    of derivatives are determined, see Note 4, Fair Value
    Measurements.

The types of contracts typically classified as derivatives are
    interest rate swaps, financial transmission rights, fixed price
    fuel contracts, natural gas futures, electricity swaps, and
    forward and option contracts for electricity, natural gas, and
    foreign currencies. Most of CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ commodity purchase and sale contracts are not
    subject to derivative accounting because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units
    specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity
    or bcf of natural gas);

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales
    exception; or

•

there is not an active market for the commodity.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ coal purchase contracts
    are not derivatives because there is not an active market for
    the coal they purchase. If an active market for coal develops in
    the future, some of these contracts may



qualify as derivatives. For Consumers, which is subject to
    regulatory accounting, the resulting

mark-to-market

gains and losses would be offset by changes in regulatory assets
    and liabilities and would not affect net income. For other
    subsidiaries, CMS Energy does not believe the resulting

mark-to-market

impact on earnings would be material.

Market Risk Information:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    are exposed to market risks including, but not limited to,
    changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and investment
    security prices. They may enter into various risk management
    contracts to limit exposure to these risks, including swaps,
    options, futures, and forward contracts. CMS Energy and
    Consumers enter into these contracts using established policies
    and procedures, under the direction of an executive oversight
    committee consisting of senior management representatives and a
    risk committee consisting of business unit managers.

These contracts contain credit risk, which is the risk that the
    counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations.
    CMS Energy and Consumers reduce this risk using established
    policies and procedures, such as evaluating counterparties’
    credit quality and setting collateral requirements as necessary.
    If terms permit, standard agreements are used that allow for the
    netting of positive and negative exposures associated with the
    same counterparty. Given these policies, present exposures, and
    credit reserves, CMS Energy and Consumers do not expect a
    material adverse effect on their financial position or future
    earnings because of counterparty nonperformance.

The following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss
    in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from financial
    instruments, including derivative contracts, assuming a
    hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices of ten
    percent. Potential losses could exceed the amounts shown in the
    sensitivity analyses if changes in market rates or prices were
    to exceed ten percent.

Interest-Rate Risk:

CMS Energy and Consumers are
    exposed to interest-rate risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate
    and variable-rate financing instruments. CMS Energy and
    Consumers use a combination of these instruments, and may also
    enter into interest-rate swap agreements, in order to manage
    this risk and to achieve a reasonable cost of capital.

    change in market interest rates of ten percent):

The fair value losses in the above table could be realized only
    if CMS Energy and Consumers transferred all of their fixed-rate
    financing to other creditors. The annual earnings exposure
    related to variable-rate financing was insignificant for both
    CMS Energy and Consumers at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    assuming an adverse change in market interest rates of ten
    percent.

Commodity Price Risk:

CMS Energy and Consumers are
    exposed to commodity price risk, which arises from fluctuations
    in the price of electricity, natural gas, coal, and other
    commodities. Commodity prices are influenced by a number of
    factors, including weather, changes in supply and demand, and
    liquidity of commodity markets. In order to manage commodity
    price risk, they may enter into various non-trading derivative
    contracts, such as forward purchase and sale contracts, options,
    and swaps.

An adverse change in market prices of ten percent would result
    in a potential reduction in fair value of less than
    $1 million for CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    derivative contracts.

Investment Securities Price Risk:

Through
    investments in debt and equity securities, CMS Energy and
    Consumers are exposed to changes in interest rates and price
    fluctuations in equity markets. The following table shows the
    potential effect of adverse changes in interest rates and
    fluctuations in equity prices on CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’

Retirement
    Benefits

Pension:

CMS Energy and Consumers have external
    trust funds to provide retirement pension benefits to their
    employees under a non-contributory, defined benefit Pension
    Plan. On September 1, 2005, the defined benefit Pension
    Plan was closed to new participants and CMS Energy and Consumers
    implemented the qualified DCCP, which provides an employer
    contribution of six percent of base pay to the existing 401(k)
    plan. An employee contribution is not required to receive the
    plan’s employer cash contribution. All employees hired on
    or after September 1, 2005 participate in this plan as part
    of their retirement benefit program. Previous cash balance
    Pension Plan participants also participate in the DCCP as of
    September 1, 2005. Additional pay credits under the cash
    balance Pension Plan were discontinued as of that date.

401(k):

CMS Energy and Consumers provide an employer
    match in their 401(k) plan equal to 60 percent on eligible
    contributions up to the first six percent of an employee’s
    wages.

OPEB:

CMS Energy and Consumers provide
    postretirement health and life benefits under their OPEB plan to
    qualifying retired employees.

CMS Energy and Consumers record liabilities for pension and OPEB
    on their Consolidated Balance Sheets at the present value of the
    future obligations, net of any plan assets. The calculation of
    the liabilities and associated expenses requires the expertise
    of actuaries, and requires many assumptions, including:

•

life expectancies;

•

discount rates;



•

expected long-term rate of return on plan assets;

•

rate of compensation increases; and

•

anticipated health care costs.

A change in these assumptions could change significantly CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ recorded liabilities and
    associated expenses.

Presented in the following table are estimates of CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ pension cost, OPEB cost, and
    cash contributions through 2013:

Contribution estimates include amounts required and
    discretionary contributions. Consumers’ pension and OPEB
    costs are recoverable through its general ratemaking process.
    Actual future pension cost and contributions will depend on
    future investment performance, changes in future discount rates,
    and various other factors related to the populations
    participating in the Pension Plan.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the Pension
    Plan assets by 0.25 percentage point (from 8.0 percent
    to 7.75 percent) would increase estimated pension cost for
    2011 by $4 million for both CMS Energy and Consumers.
    Lowering the discount rate by 0.25 percentage point (from
    5.40 percent to 5.15 percent) would increase estimated
    pension cost for 2011 by $5 million for both CMS Energy and
    Consumers.

For additional details on postretirement benefits, see
    Note 11, Retirement Benefits.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

CMS Energy and Consumers are required to record the fair value
    of the cost to remove assets at the end of their useful lives if
    there is a legal obligation to remove them. CMS Energy and
    Consumers have legal obligations to remove some of their assets
    at the end of their useful lives. CMS Energy and Consumers
    calculate the fair value of ARO liabilities using an expected
    present value technique that reflects assumptions about costs,
    inflation, and profit margin that third parties would require to
    assume the obligation. CMS Energy and Consumers did not include
    market risk premiums in their ARO fair value estimates since
    reasonable estimates could not be made.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the
    period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with
    indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. CMS Energy and
    Consumers have not recorded liabilities for assets that have
    insignificant cumulative disposal costs, such as substation
    batteries. For additional details, see Note 16, Asset
    Retirement Obligations.

NEW ACCOUNTING
    STANDARDS

For details regarding the implementation of new accounting
    standards and new accounting standards issued that are not yet
    effective, see Note 2, New Accounting Standards.

CMS Energy
    Corporation

Consumers Energy
    Company

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1:

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Corporate Structure:

CMS Energy is an energy company
    operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding
    company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an
    electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a
    domestic IPP. CMS Energy and Consumers manage their businesses
    by the nature of services each provides. CMS Energy operates
    principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas
    utility; and enterprises, its non-utility investments and
    operations. Consumers operates principally in two business
    segments: electric utility and gas utility.

Principles of Consolidation:

CMS Energy and
    Consumers prepare their Consolidated Financial Statements in
    conformity with GAAP. CMS Energy’s Consolidated Financial
    Statements comprise CMS Energy, Consumers, CMS Enterprises, and
    all other entities in which CMS Energy has a controlling
    financial interest or is the primary beneficiary.
    Consumers’ Consolidated Financial Statements comprise
    Consumers and all other entities in which it has a controlling
    financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. CMS Energy
    uses the equity method of accounting for investments in
    companies and partnerships that are not consolidated, where they
    have significant influence over operations and financial
    policies but are not the primary beneficiary. CMS Energy and
    Consumers eliminate intercompany transactions and balances.

Use of Estimates:

CMS Energy and Consumers are
    required to make estimates using assumptions that may affect
    reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

CMS Energy and Consumers record estimated liabilities for
    contingencies in their Consolidated Financial Statements when it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred and when the
    amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. For additional
    details, see Note 5, Contingencies and Commitments.

Revenue Recognition Policy:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    recognize revenue from deliveries of electricity and natural
    gas, and from the transportation, processing, and storage of
    natural gas, when services are provided. CMS Energy and
    Consumers record unbilled revenue for the estimated amount of
    energy delivered to customers but not yet billed. CMS Energy and
    Consumers record sales tax net and exclude it from revenue. CMS
    Energy recognizes revenue on sales of marketed electricity,
    natural gas, and other energy products at delivery.

Alternative-Revenue Programs:

In September 2009, the
    MPSC approved an energy optimization incentive mechanism that
    provides a financial incentive if the energy savings of
    Consumers’ customers exceed annual targets established by
    the MPSC. Consumers accounts for this program as an
    alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for
    recognizing revenue related to the incentive as soon as energy
    savings exceed the annual targets established by the MPSC.

Under electric and gas rate orders issued by the MPSC in 2009
    and 2010, Consumers was granted authority to implement revenue
    decoupling mechanisms. The electric decoupling mechanism adjusts
    customer rates to collect or refund the change in marginal
    revenue arising from the difference between the level of average
    sales per customer adopted in the electric rate order and actual
    average sales per customer. The gas decoupling mechanism is
    similar, but does not adjust customer rates for changes in sales
    volumes resulting from weather fluctuations. Consumers accounts
    for these programs as alternative-revenue programs that meet the
    criteria for recognizing the effects of decoupling adjustments
    on revenue as electricity and gas are delivered. For details on
    Consumers’ decoupling mechanisms, see Note 6,
    Regulatory Matters.

Self-Implemented Rates:

Unless prohibited by the
    MPSC upon a showing of good cause, Consumers is allowed to
    self-implement new energy rates six months after a new rate case
    filing if the MPSC has not issued an order in the case. The MPSC
    then has another six months to issue a final order. If the MPSC
    does not issue an order, the filed rates are considered
    approved. If the MPSC issues an order, the rates that Consumers
    self-implemented may be subject to refund, with interest.
    Consumers recognizes revenue associated with self-implemented
    rates. If Consumers considers it probable that it will be
    required to refund a portion of its self-implemented rates, then



CMS Energy
    Corporation

Consumers Energy
    Company

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Consumers records a provision for revenue subject to refund. For
    details on Consumers’ self-implemented rates, see
    Note 6, Regulatory Matters.

Accounting for Legal Fees:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    expense legal fees as incurred; fees incurred but not yet billed
    are accrued based on estimates of work performed. This policy
    also applies to any fees incurred on behalf of employees and
    officers under indemnification agreements; such fees are billed
    directly to CMS Energy or Consumers.

Accounting for MISO Transactions:

MISO requires the
    submission of hourly day-ahead and real-time bids and offers for
    energy at locations across the MISO region. Consumers and CMS
    ERM account for MISO transactions on a net hourly basis in each
    of the real-time and day-ahead markets, and they net
    transactions across all MISO energy market locations. CMS Energy
    and Consumers record net purchases in a single hour in Purchased
    and interchange power and net sales in a single hour in
    Operating Revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income. They
    record net sale billing adjustments upon invoice receipt, record
    expense accruals for future net purchases adjustments based on
    historical experience, and reconcile accruals to actual expenses
    upon invoice receipt.

Accounts Receivable:

Accounts receivable comprise
    trade receivables and unbilled receivables. CMS Energy and
    Consumers record their accounts receivable at cost, which
    approximates fair value. CMS Energy and Consumers establish an
    allowance for uncollectible accounts and loan losses based on
    historical losses, management’s assessment of existing
    economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. CMS
    Energy and Consumers assess late payment fees on trade
    receivables based on contractual past-due terms established with
    customers. CMS Energy and Consumers charge off accounts deemed
    uncollectible to operating expense.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents
    include short-term, highly liquid investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Derivative Instruments:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    record derivative contracts that do not qualify for the normal
    purchases and sales exception at fair value on their
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. If a derivative qualifies for cash
    flow hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are recorded in
    AOCI; otherwise, changes are reported in earnings. For
    additional details regarding derivative instruments, see
    Note 10, Derivative Instruments.

Determination of Pension and OPEB MRV of Plan
    Assets:

CMS Energy and Consumers determine the MRV for
    pension plan assets as the fair value of plan assets on the
    measurement date, adjusted by the gains or losses that will not
    be admitted into the MRV until future years. CMS Energy and
    Consumers reflect each year’s gain or loss in the MRV in
    equal amounts over a five-year period beginning on the date the
    original amount was determined. CMS Energy and Consumers
    determine the MRV for OPEB plan assets as the fair value of
    assets on the measurement date. CMS Energy and Consumers use the
    MRV in the calculation of net pension and OPEB costs.

Earnings Per Share:

CMS Energy calculates basic and
    diluted EPS using the weighted-average number of shares of
    common stock and dilutive potential common stock outstanding
    during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of
    determining diluted EPS, includes the effects of dilutive stock
    options, warrants, and convertible securities. CMS Energy
    computes the effect on potential common stock using the treasury
    stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable. Diluted
    EPS excludes the impact of antidilutive securities, which are
    those securities resulting in an increase in EPS or a decrease
    in loss per share. For EPS computations, see Note 8,
    Earnings Per Share — CMS Energy.

Financial Instruments:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    record debt and equity securities classified as available for
    sale at fair value as determined from quoted market prices or
    other observable, market-based inputs. Unrealized gains and
    losses on these securities are determined on a
    specific-identification basis. CMS Energy and Consumers report
    unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of the
    equity securities, net of tax, in equity as part of AOCI, except
    that unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary are
    reported in earnings. CMS Energy



CMS Energy
    Corporation

Consumers Energy
    Company

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

and Consumers report unrealized gains resulting from changes in
    fair value of the debt securities, net of tax, in equity as part
    of AOCI. Unrealized losses on the debt securities, if
    significant, are considered other than temporary and reported in
    earnings since these securities are managed by an independent
    investment manager that can sell the securities at its own
    discretion. For additional details regarding financial
    instruments, see Note 9, Financial Instruments.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method
    Investments:

CMS Energy and Consumers perform tests of
    impairment if certain triggering events occur, or if there has
    been a decline in value that may be other than temporary.

CMS Energy and Consumers evaluate long-lived assets held in use
    for impairment by calculating the undiscounted future cash flows
    expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
    disposition. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than
    the carrying amount, CMS Energy and Consumers recognize an
    impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount
    exceeds the fair value. CMS Energy and Consumers estimate the
    fair value of the asset using quoted market prices, market
    prices of similar assets, or discounted future cash flow
    analyses.

CMS Energy also assesses equity method investments for
    impairment whenever there has been a decline in value that is
    other than temporary. This assessment requires CMS Energy to
    determine the fair value of the equity method investment. CMS
    Energy determines fair value using valuation methodologies,
    including discounted cash flows, and assesses the ability of the
    investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the
    carrying amount of the investment. CMS Energy records an
    impairment if the fair value is less than the carrying amount
    and the decline in value is considered to be other than
    temporary.

For additional details, see Note 20, Asset Sales,
    Discontinued Operations, and Impairment Charges.

Inventory:

CMS Energy and Consumers use the
    weighted-average cost method for valuing working gas,
    recoverable base gas in underground storage facilities, and
    materials and supplies inventory. CMS Energy and Consumers also
    use this method for valuing coal inventory, and they classify
    these amounts as Generating plant fuel stock on their
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

CMS Energy and Consumers classify RECs and emission allowances
    as materials and supplies inventory and use the average cost
    method to remove amounts from inventory. RECs and emission
    allowances are used to satisfy compliance obligations related to
    the generation of power.

CMS Energy and Consumers use the

lower-of-cost-or-market

method to evaluate inventory for impairment.

Maintenance and Depreciation:

CMS Energy and
    Consumers record property repairs and minor property replacement
    as maintenance expense. CMS Energy and Consumers record planned
    major maintenance activities as operating expense unless the
    cost represents the acquisition of additional long-lived assets
    or the replacement of an existing long-lived asset.

Consumers depreciates utility property on an asset-group basis,
    in which it applies a single MPSC-approved depreciation rate to
    the gross investment in a particular class of property within
    the electric and gas segments. Consumers performs depreciation
    studies periodically to determine appropriate group lives.
    Presented in the following table are the composite depreciation
    rates for Consumers’ segment properties:

    as current Notes receivable and $375 million were
    classified as non-current Notes receivable on CMS Energy’s
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2009,
    $1 million of EnerBank’s loans were classified as
    current Notes receivable and $268 million were classified
    as non-current Notes receivable on CMS Energy’s
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance to
    reflect probable credit losses. The allowance is increased by
    the provision for loan losses and decreased by loan charge-offs
    net of recoveries. Management estimates the allowance balance
    required using historical loan loss experience, the nature and
    volume of the portfolio, economic conditions, and other factors.
    Loans losses are charged against the allowance when the loss is
    confirmed, but no later than the point at which a loan becomes
    120 days past due.

Loans that are 30 days or more past due are considered
    delinquent. Presented in the following table is the delinquency
    status of EnerBank’s consumer loans at December 31,

Plant, Property, and Equipment:

CMS Energy and
    Consumers record plant, property, and equipment at original cost
    when placed into service. The cost includes labor, material,
    applicable taxes, overhead such as pension and other benefits,
    and AFUDC, if applicable. Consumers’ plant, property, and
    equipment is generally recoverable through its general rate
    making process. For additional details see Note 6,
    Regulatory Matters.

When utility property is retired or otherwise disposed of in the
    ordinary course of business, Consumers records the original cost
    to accumulated depreciation, along with associated cost of
    removal, net of salvage. CMS Energy and Consumers recognize
    gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of non-regulated
    assets in income. Cost of removal collected from customers, but
    not spent, is recorded as a regulatory liability.

Consumers capitalizes AFUDC on regulated major construction
    projects, except pollution control facilities on its
    fossil-fueled power plants, and where financing costs are
    specifically approved by the MPSC in rates. AFUDC represents the
    estimated cost of debt and authorized

return-on-equity

funds used to finance construction additions. Consumers records
    the offsetting credit as a reduction of interest for the amount
    representing the borrowed funds component and as Other income
    for the equity funds component on the Consolidated Statements of
    Income. When construction is completed and the property is
    placed in service, Consumers depreciates and recovers the
    capitalized AFUDC from customers over the life of the related
    asset. Presented in the following table are Consumers’
    composite AFUDC capitalization rates:

Years Ended December 31

CMS Energy and Consumers capitalize the purchase and development
    of internal-use computer software. These costs are expensed
    evenly over the estimated useful life of the internal-use
    computer software. If computer software is integral to computer
    hardware, then its cost is capitalized and depreciated with the
    hardware.

The types of costs capitalized are consistent for all periods
    presented by the financial statements. For additional details on
    plant, property, and equipment see Note 15, Plant,
    Property, and Equipment.

Property Taxes:

Property taxes are based on the
    taxable value of Consumers’ real and personal property
    assessed by local taxing authorities. Consumers records property
    tax expense over the fiscal year of the taxing

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

authority for which the taxes are levied based on
    Consumers’ budgeted customer sales. The deferred property
    tax balance represents the amount of Consumers’ accrued
    property tax that will be recognized over future governmental
    fiscal periods.

Reclassifications:

CMS Energy and Consumers have
    reclassified certain prior-period amounts on their Consolidated
    Financial Statements to conform to the presentation for the
    current period. These reclassifications did not affect
    consolidated net income or cash flows for the periods presented.

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents:

CMS Energy and
    Consumers have restricted cash and cash equivalents dedicated
    for repayment of Securitization bonds and for payment under
    performance guarantees. CMS Energy and Consumers classify these
    amounts as a current asset, as they relate to payments that
    could occur within one year.

Unamortized Debt Premium, Discount, and Expense:

CMS
    Energy and Consumers defer premiums, discounts, and issuance
    costs of long-term debt and amortize those costs over the terms
    of the debt issues. For the non-regulated portions of CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses, refinancing costs
    are expensed as incurred. For the regulated portions of CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses, any remaining
    unamortized premiums, discounts, and issuance costs associated
    with refinanced debt are amortized over the term of the newly
    issued debt.

NEW ACCOUNTING
    STANDARDS

Implementation
    of New Accounting Standards

SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial
    Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140,

codified through

ASU

No. 2009-16,

Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Accounting for Transfers of
    Financial Assets:

This standard, which was effective for CMS
    Energy and Consumers January 1, 2010, removes the concept
    of a qualifying special-purpose entity from guidance relating to
    transfers of financial assets and extinguishments of
    liabilities. It also removes the exceptions from applying
    guidance relating to VIEs to qualifying special-purpose
    entities. This standard revises and clarifies when an entity is
    required to derecognize a financial asset that it has
    transferred to another entity. It further clarifies how to
    measure beneficial interests received as proceeds in connection
    with a transfer of a financial asset, and introduces the concept
    of a “participating interest,” the conditions of which
    must be met for a partial asset transfer to qualify for sale
    accounting treatment. The standard also requires enhanced
    disclosures related to continuing involvement with financial
    assets. Under this standard, transactions entered into under
    Consumers’ revolving accounts receivable sales program,
    discussed in Note 7, Financings and Capitalization, are
    accounted for as secured borrowings rather than as sales. CMS
    Energy and Consumers present outstanding amounts under the
    program as short-term debt collateralized by accounts receivable.

SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation
    No. 46(R),

codified through

ASU

No. 2009-17,

Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting
    by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities:

This standard, which was effective for CMS Energy and
    Consumers January 1, 2010, amends the criteria used to
    determine which entity, if any, has a controlling financial
    interest in a VIE. It replaces the quantitative calculation of
    risks and rewards with a qualitative approach focused on
    identifying which entity (1) has the power to direct the
    activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the
    VIE’s economic performance and (2) has the obligation
    to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits
    from the VIE. This standard also requires ongoing assessments of
    whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Upon
    implementation of this guidance, CMS Energy concluded that it is
    the primary beneficiary of CMS Energy Trust I and
    consolidated the trust in its Consolidated Financial Statements
    on January 1, 2010. CMS Energy also concluded that it is
    not the primary beneficiary of T.E.S. Filer City, Grayling, or
    Genesee and deconsolidated these partnerships in its
    Consolidated Financial Statements on January 1, 2010. CMS
    Energy consolidated CMS Energy Trust I at the carrying
    value that would be recorded had this guidance been effective
    when CMS Energy initially became involved

with CMS Energy Trust I. CMS Energy recorded its retained
    interest in the deconsolidated partnerships at the carrying
    value that would be recorded had this guidance been effective
    when CMS Energy initially became involved with the partnerships.
    CMS Energy and Consumers have chosen not to adjust previously
    reported balances. No cumulative effect adjustments were
    required. For additional details, see Note 18, Variable
    Interest Entities.

FAIR VALUE
    MEASUREMENTS

Accounting standards define fair value as the price that would
    be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
    an orderly transaction between market participants. When
    measuring fair value, CMS Energy and Consumers are required to
    incorporate all assumptions that market participants would use
    in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about
    risk. A fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs used to measure
    fair value according to their observability in the market. The
    three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

•

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 inputs are observable, market-based inputs, other
    than Level 1 prices. Level 2 inputs may include quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
    quoted prices in inactive markets, interest rates and yield
    curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, credit risks,
    default rates, and inputs derived from or corroborated by
    observable market data.

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect CMS
    Energy’s or Consumers’ own assumptions about how
    market participants would value their assets and liabilities.

To the extent possible, CMS Energy and Consumers use quoted
    market prices or other observable market pricing data in valuing
    assets and liabilities measured at fair value. If this
    information is unavailable, they use market-corroborated data or
    reasonable estimates about market participant assumptions. CMS
    Energy and Consumers classify fair value measurements within the
    fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is
    significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents and restricted
    cash equivalents consist of money market funds with daily
    liquidity. The funds invest in U.S. Treasury notes, other
    government-backed securities, and repurchase agreements
    collateralized by U.S. Treasury notes.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Assets:

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ nonqualified deferred
    compensation plan assets are invested in various mutual funds.
    CMS Energy and Consumers value these assets using a market
    approach, using the daily quoted NAVs provided by the fund
    managers that are the basis for transactions to buy or sell
    shares in each fund. CMS Energy and Consumers report these
    assets in Other non-current assets on their Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

SERP Assets:

CMS Energy and Consumers value their
    SERP assets using a market approach, incorporating prices and
    other relevant information from market transactions. The SERP
    cash equivalents consist of a money market fund with daily
    liquidity, which invests in state and municipal securities.

The SERP invests in a short-term, fixed-income mutual fund that
    holds a variety of debt securities with average maturities of
    one to three years. The fund invests primarily in
    investment-grade debt securities but, in order to achieve its
    investment objective, it may invest a portion of its assets in
    high-yield securities, foreign debt, and derivative instruments.
    The fair value of the fund is determined using the daily
    published NAV, which is the basis for transactions to buy or
    sell shares in the fund.

The SERP state and municipal bonds are investment grade
    securities that are valued using a matrix pricing model that
    incorporates Level 2 market-based information. The fair
    value of the bonds is derived from various



CMS Energy
    Corporation

Consumers Energy
    Company

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

observable inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades,
    broker/dealer quotes, bond ratings, and general information on
    market movements normally considered by market participants when
    pricing such debt securities. CMS Energy and Consumers report
    their SERP assets in Other non-current assets on their
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional details about SERP
    securities, see Note 9, Financial Instruments.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
    Liabilities:

CMS Energy and Consumers value their
    non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities based on
    the fair values of the plan assets, as they reflect what is owed
    to the plan participants in accordance with their investment
    elections. CMS Energy and Consumers report these liabilities in
    Other non-current liabilities on their Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

Derivative Instruments:

CMS Energy and Consumers
    value their derivative instruments using either a market
    approach that incorporates information from market transactions,
    or an income approach that discounts future expected cash flows
    to a present value amount. They use various inputs to value the
    derivatives depending on the type of contract and the
    availability of market data. CMS Energy has exchange-traded
    derivative contracts that are valued based on Level 1
    quoted prices in actively traded markets, as well as derivatives
    that are valued using Level 2 inputs, including commodity
    market prices, interest rates, credit ratings, default rates,
    and market-based seasonality factors. CMS Energy and Consumers
    have classified certain derivatives as Level 3 since the
    fair value measurements incorporate pricing assumptions that
    cannot be observed or confirmed through market transactions.

CMS Energy’s derivatives include an electricity sales
    agreement held by CMS ERM that extends beyond the term for which
    quoted electricity prices are available. To value this
    agreement, CMS Energy uses an internally developed model to
    project future prices. This method incorporates a proprietary
    forward power pricing curve that is based on forward gas prices
    and an implied heat rate. CMS Energy also increases the fair
    value of the liability for this agreement by an amount that
    reflects the uncertainty of its model. Since the modeling
    technique is significant to the overall fair value measurement,
    this agreement is classified as Level 3.

For all fair values other than Level 1 prices, CMS Energy
    and Consumers incorporate adjustments for the risk of
    nonperformance. For derivative assets, a credit adjustment is
    applied against the asset based on the published default rate
    for the credit rating that CMS Energy and Consumers assign to
    the counterparty based on an internal credit-scoring model. This
    model considers various inputs, including the
    counterparty’s financial statements, credit reports, trade
    press, and other information that would be available to market
    participants. To the extent that the internal ratings are
    comparable to credit ratings published by independent rating
    agencies, the resulting credit adjustment is classified within
    Level 2. If the internal model results in a rating that is
    outside of the range of ratings given by the independent
    agencies and the credit adjustment is significant to the overall
    valuation, the derivative fair value is classified as
    Level 3. CMS Energy and Consumers adjust their derivative
    liabilities downward to reflect the risk of their own
    nonperformance, based on their published credit ratings.
    Adjustments for credit risk using the approach outlined within
    this paragraph are not materially different from the adjustments
    that would result from using credit default swap rates for the
    contracts presently held. For additional details about
    derivative contracts, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments.

CONTINGENCIES AND
    COMMITMENTS

CMS
    Energy Contingencies

Gas Index Price Reporting Investigation:

In 2002,
    CMS Energy notified appropriate regulatory and governmental
    agencies that some employees at CMS MST and CMS Field Services
    appeared to have provided inaccurate information regarding
    natural gas trades to various energy industry publications,
    which compile and report index prices. CMS Energy cooperated
    with an investigation by the DOJ regarding this matter. Although
    CMS Energy has not received any formal notification that the DOJ
    has completed its investigation, the DOJ’s last request for
    information occurred in 2003, and CMS Energy completed its
    response to this request in 2004. CMS Energy is unable to
    predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation and what effect, if
    any, the investigation will have on CMS Energy.

Gas Index Price Reporting Litigation:

CMS Energy,
    along with CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas,
    Inc., and Cantera Gas Company, are named as defendants in
    various class action and individual lawsuits arising as a result
    of alleged inaccurate natural gas price reporting to
    publications that report trade information. Allegations include
    manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures and options prices,
    price-fixing conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial
    inflation of natural gas retail prices in Colorado, Kansas,
    Missouri, and Wisconsin. The following provides more detail on
    these proceedings:

•

In 2005, CMS MST was served with a summons and complaint that
    named CMS Energy, CMS MST, and CMS Field Services as defendants
    in a putative class action filed in Kansas state court, Learjet,
    Inc., et al. v. Oneok, Inc., et al. The complaint alleges
    that during the putative class period, January 1, 2000
    through October 31, 2002, the defendants engaged in a
    scheme to violate the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The
    plaintiffs, who allege they purchased natural gas from the
    defendants and others for their facilities, are seeking
    statutory full consideration damages consisting of the full
    consideration paid by plaintiffs for natural gas.

•

In 2007, a class action complaint, Heartland Regional Medical
    Center, et al. v. Oneok, Inc. et al., was filed in Missouri
    state court alleging violations of Missouri antitrust laws.
    Defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS Field Services, and CMS
    MST, are alleged to have violated the Missouri antitrust law in
    connection with their natural gas price reporting activities.

•

Breckenridge Brewery of Colorado, LLC and BBD Acquisition
    Co. v. Oneok, Inc., et al., a class action complaint
    brought on behalf of retail direct purchasers of natural gas in
    Colorado, was filed in Colorado state court in May 2006.
    Defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS Field Services, and CMS
    MST, are alleged to have violated the Colorado Antitrust Act of
    1992 in connection with their natural gas price reporting
    activities. Plaintiffs are seeking full refund damages.

•

A class action complaint, Arandell Corp., et al. v. XCEL
    Energy Inc., et al., was filed in 2006 in Wisconsin state court
    on behalf of Wisconsin commercial entities that purchased
    natural gas between January 1, 2000 and October 31,
    2002. The defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS ERM, and Cantera
    Gas Company, are alleged to have violated Wisconsin’s
    antitrust statute. The plaintiffs are seeking full consideration
    damages, plus exemplary damages, and attorneys’ fees. After
    dismissal on jurisdictional grounds in 2009, plaintiffs filed a
    new case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
    District of Michigan. In November 2010, the MDL judge issued an
    opinion and order granting the CMS Energy defendants’
    motion to dismiss the new Michigan case on

statute-of-limitations

grounds and all CMS Energy defendants have been dismissed from
    the Arandell Michigan case.

Another class action complaint, Newpage Wisconsin System v.
    CMS ERM, CMS Energy, and Cantera Gas Company, was filed in 2009
    in circuit court in Wood County, Wisconsin, against CMS Energy
    defendants and 19 other non-CMS Energy companies. The plaintiff
    is seeking full consideration damages, treble damages, costs,
    interest, and attorneys’ fees.

In 2005, J.P. Morgan Trust Company, in its capacity as
    Trustee of the FLI Liquidating Trust, filed an action in Kansas
    state court against a number of energy companies, including CMS
    Energy, CMS MST, and CMS Field Services. The complaint alleges
    various claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The
    plaintiff is seeking statutory full consideration damages for
    its purchases of natural gas between January 1, 2000 and
    December 31, 2001. This case is not a class action.

After removal to federal court, the Learjet, Heartland,
    Breckenridge, both Arandell cases, Newpage, and J.P. Morgan
    cases were transferred to the MDL case. CMS Energy was dismissed
    from the Learjet, Heartland, and J.P. Morgan cases in 2009,
    but other CMS Energy defendants remain parties. All CMS Energy
    defendants were dismissed from the Breckenridge case in 2009. It
    is expected that the plaintiffs in this case will appeal this
    decision after all claims against defendants have been
    dismissed. At this time, there is no pending appeal. In June
    2010, CMS Energy and Cantera Gas Company were dismissed from the
    Newpage case; the Arandell (Wisconsin) case was reinstated
    against CMS ERM; and the Arandell (Wisconsin) case was
    consolidated with the Newpage case. These two consolidated cases
    remain pending only against CMS ERM. Pending before the court in
    all of the MDL cases are the defendants’ renewed motions
    for summary judgment based on FERC preemption. In all but the
    J.P. Morgan case, there are also pending plaintiffs’
    motions for class certification. These motions are not yet
    decided. In October 2010, the MDL court entered an order denying
    the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend their complaint
    to add a federal Sherman Act antitrust claim.

These cases involve complex facts, a large number of similarly
    situated defendants with different factual positions, and
    multiple jurisdictions. Presently, any estimate of liability
    would be highly speculative; the amount of CMS Energy’s
    possible loss would be based on widely varying models previously
    untested in this context. Defenses are being pursued vigorously,
    which could result in the dismissal of the cases completely, but
    CMS Energy is unable to predict the outcome of these matters. If
    the outcome is unfavorable, these cases could have a material
    adverse impact on CMS Energy’s liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

Bay Harbor:

As part of the development of Bay Harbor
    by certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy, and under an agreement
    with the MDNRE, third parties constructed a golf course and park
    over several abandoned CKD piles left over from the former
    cement plant operations on the Bay Harbor site. The third
    parties also undertook a series of response activities,
    including constructing a leachate collection system in one area
    where CKD-impacted groundwater was entering Little Traverse Bay.
    Leachate is produced when water enters into the CKD piles. In
    2002, CMS Energy sold its interest in Bay Harbor, but retained
    its obligations under environmental indemnities entered into at
    the start of the project.

In 2005, the EPA, along with CMS Land and CMS Capital,
    voluntarily executed an Administrative Order on Consent under
    Superfund, and the EPA approved a Removal Action Work Plan to
    address contamination issues. Collection systems required under
    the plan have been installed and effectiveness monitoring of the
    systems at the shoreline is ongoing. CMS Land, CMS Capital, and
    the EPA agreed upon augmentation measures to address areas where
    pH measurements were not satisfactory. Several augmentation
    measures were implemented and completed in 2009, with the
    remaining measure completed in 2010.

In December 2010, CMS Energy recorded a charge of
    $40 million to increase the remaining liability for Bay
    Harbor as a result of recent developments. The factors that
    contributed to this revision of estimated costs include
    anticipated cost increases for the disposal of leachate under an
    NPDES permit issued by the MDNRE in December 2010, additional
    costs for the scope of remediation to meet EPA and MDNRE
    requirements, and increased legal, management, and engineering
    costs anticipated to reach agreement with all parties on the
    long-term remedy for the

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Bay Harbor site. The NPDES permit issued by the MDNRE authorizes
    CMS Land to discharge treated leachate into Little Traverse Bay.
    This permit requires renewal every five years. CMS Land also
    completed mercury modeling studies as required by the EPA in
    November 2010. The completion of these studies was necessary to
    finalize the scope of remedies that was submitted to the EPA in
    December 2010. Additionally, CMS Land has committed to
    investigate the potential for a deep injection well on the Bay
    Harbor site as an alternative long-term solution to the leachate
    disposal issue. In 2008, the MDNRE and the EPA granted permits
    for CMS Land or its wholly owned subsidiary, Beeland Group LLC,
    to construct and operate an off-site deep injection well in
    Antrim County, Michigan, to dispose of leachate from Bay Harbor.
    Certain environmental groups, a local township, and a local
    county filed lawsuits appealing the permits. The legal
    proceeding was stayed in 2009 and can be renewed by either party
    at any time.

Various claims have been brought against CMS Land or its
    affiliates, including CMS Energy, alleging environmental damage
    to property, loss of property value, insufficient disclosure of
    environmental matters, breach of agreement relating to access,
    or other matters. There is presently one lawsuit
    (Jankowski v. CMS Energy, CMS Capital, and CMS Land)
    pending that was filed in June 2010 in Emmet County Circuit
    Court in Michigan relating to such subjects. Resolution of this
    lawsuit is not expected to have a material impact on CMS
    Energy’s consolidated income, cash flows, or financial
    position. In October 2010, CMS Land and other parties received a
    demand for payment from the EPA in the amount of
    $7 million, plus interest, whereby the EPA is seeking
    recovery, as allowed under Superfund, of the EPA’s response
    costs incurred at the Bay Harbor site. CMS Land believes that
    this is not a valid claim and intends to dispute it.

CMS Land and CMS Capital, the MDNRE, the EPA, and other parties
    continue to negotiate the long-term remedy for the Bay Harbor
    site, including:

•

the disposal of leachate;

•

the capping and excavation of CKD;

•

the location and design of collection lines and upstream water
    diversion systems;

•

application of criteria for various substances such as
    mercury; and

•

other matters that are likely to affect the scope of response
    activities that CMS Land and CMS Capital may be obligated to
    undertake.

CMS Energy has recorded a cumulative charge related to Bay
    Harbor of $222 million, which with accretion expense,
    includes $43 million recorded in 2010, $37 million in
    2009, and $1 million in 2008, in Other operating expenses
    on the Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31,
    2010, CMS Energy had a recorded liability of $98 million
    for its remaining obligations. CMS Energy calculated this
    liability based on discounted projected costs, using a discount
    rate of 4.34 percent and an inflation rate of one percent
    on annual operating and maintenance costs. CMS Energy based the
    discount rate on the interest rate for

30-year

U.S. Treasury securities at December 31, 2010. The
    undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is
    $121 million. CMS Energy expects to pay $34 million
    during 2011, $12 million in 2012, $5 million in 2013,
    $5 million in 2014, $4 million in 2015, and the
    remaining amount thereafter on long-term liquid disposal and
    operating and maintenance costs.

CMS Energy’s estimate of response activity costs and the
    timing of expenditures could change if there are additional
    major changes in circumstances or assumptions, including but not
    limited to:

•

inability to complete the present long-term water disposal
    strategy at a reasonable cost;

•

delays in implementing the present long-term water disposal
    strategy;

•

requirements to alter the present long-term water disposal
    strategy upon expiration of the NPDES permit if the MDNRE or EPA
    identify a more suitable alternative;



CMS Energy

•

an increase in the number of contamination areas;

•

different remediation techniques;

•

the nature and extent of contamination;

•

inability to reach agreement with the MDNRE or the EPA over
    additional response activities;

•

delays in the receipt of requested permits;

•

delays following the receipt of any requested permits due to
    legal appeals of third parties;

•

additional or new legal or regulatory requirements; or

•

new or different landowner claims.

Depending on the size of any indemnity obligation or liability
    under environmental laws, an adverse outcome of this matter
    could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s
    liquidity and financial condition and could negatively affect
    CMS Energy’s financial results. Although a liability for
    its present estimate of remaining response activity costs has
    been recorded, CMS Energy cannot predict the ultimate financial
    impact or outcome of this matter.

State Street Bank and TSU Litigation:

In 2002, State
    Street Bank sued CMS Viron in the District Court of Harris
    County, Texas, claiming primarily a breach of representations
    and warranties and seeking $9 million plus interest from
    CMS Viron. During the same year, CMS Viron filed a counterclaim,
    as well as third-party actions against TSU, Academic Capital
    Group, Inc., and Academic Services, Inc. for breach of contract
    and fiduciary duties and conversion. At December 31, 2010,
    CMS Energy had a recorded liability of $3 million for its
    potential obligation related to this matter. This case was
    resolved in January 2011 for an amount that will not have a
    material impact on CMS Energy’s consolidated income, cash
    flows, or financial position.

Equatorial Guinea Tax Claim:

In 2004, CMS Energy
    received a request for indemnification from the purchaser of CMS
    Oil and Gas. The indemnity claim relates to the sale of CMS
    Energy’s oil, gas, and methanol projects in Equatorial
    Guinea and the claim of the government of Equatorial Guinea that
    CMS Energy owes $142 million in taxes in connection with
    that sale. CMS Energy concluded that the government’s tax
    claim is without merit and the purchaser of CMS Oil and Gas
    submitted a response to the government rejecting the claim. The
    government of Equatorial Guinea has indicated that it still
    intends to pursue its claim. CMS Energy cannot predict the
    financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Marathon Indemnity Claim regarding F.T. Barr
    Claim:

In 2001, F.T. Barr filed a lawsuit in Harris
    County District Court in Texas against CMS Energy, CMS Oil and
    Gas, and other defendants alleging that his overriding royalty
    payments related to Alba field production were improperly
    calculated. In 2004, all parties signed a confidential
    settlement agreement that resolved claims between Barr and the
    defendants. The CMS Energy defendants reserved all defenses to
    any indemnity claim relating to the settlement.

In April 2009, certain Marathon entities filed a case in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas
    against CMS Enterprises for indemnification in connection with
    this matter. In December 2010, CMS Energy and Marathon signed a
    confidential settlement agreement that resolved this matter.
    This settlement did not have a material impact on CMS
    Energy’s consolidated income, cash flows, or financial
    position.

Former NOMECO Employees’ Litigation:

In June
    2010, eight former employees of NOMECO filed a lawsuit in Ingham
    County Circuit Court in Michigan against CMS Energy and three
    Marathon entities (Richard Rulewicz, Trustee of the Richard
    Rulewicz Revocable Living Trust, et al. v. CMS Energy)
    alleging underpayment of the former employees’ overriding
    royalty payments related to the Alba field production in
    Equatorial Guinea, to which the plaintiffs claim to be entitled.
    CMS Oil and Gas sold its interests in the Alba field to Marathon
    in 2002. CMS Energy believes that it may be entitled to full or
    partial indemnification from Marathon for monetary damages

that may arise from this lawsuit. Although CMS Energy cannot
    predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of this litigation,
    the resolution of this matter is not expected to have a material
    adverse impact on CMS Energy’s consolidated income, cash
    flows, or financial position.

Consumers’
    Electric Utility Contingencies

Electric Environmental Matters:

Consumers’
    operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations.
    Generally, Consumers has been able to recover, in customer
    rates, the costs to operate its facilities in compliance with
    these laws and regulations.

Cleanup and Solid Waste:

Consumers expects to incur
    remediation and other response activity costs at a number of
    sites under NREPA. Consumers believes that these costs should be
    recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. At
    December 31, 2010, Consumers had a recorded liability of
    $2 million, its estimated probable NREPA liability.

Consumers is a potentially responsible party at a number of
    contaminated sites administered under the Superfund. Superfund
    liability is joint and several. In addition to Consumers, many
    other creditworthy parties with substantial assets are
    potentially responsible with respect to the individual sites. In
    November 2010, Consumers received official notification from the
    EPA that identified Consumers as a potentially responsible party
    at the Kalamazoo River Superfund site. The notification claimed
    that the EPA has reason to believe Consumers disposed of PCBs
    and arranged for the disposal and treatment of PCB-containing
    materials at portions of the site. Consumers responded to the
    EPA in December 2010, stating that it has no information showing
    that it disposed of PCBs or arranged for disposal or treatment
    of PCB-containing material at portions of the site and
    requesting further information from the EPA before Consumers
    would commit to perform or finance cleanup activities at the
    site. Until further information is received from the EPA,
    Consumers is unable to estimate a range of potential liability
    for cleanup of the river.

Based on its experience, Consumers estimates that its share of
    the total liability for other known Superfund sites will be
    between $2 million and $8 million. Various factors,
    including the number of potentially responsible parties involved
    with each site, affect Consumers’ share of the total
    liability. At December 31, 2010, Consumers had a recorded
    liability of $2 million, the minimum amount in the range of
    its estimated probable Superfund liability.

The timing of payments related to Consumers’ remediation
    and other response activities at its Superfund and NREPA sites
    is uncertain. Consumers periodically reviews these cost
    estimates. Any significant change in the underlying assumptions,
    such as an increase in the number of sites, different
    remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and
    legal and regulatory requirements, could affect its estimates of
    NREPA and Superfund liability.

Ludington PCB:

In 1998, during routine maintenance
    activities, Consumers identified PCB as a component in certain
    paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington. Consumers
    removed and replaced part of the PCB material with non-PCB
    material. Since proposing a plan to take action with respect to
    the remaining materials, Consumers has had several
    communications with the EPA. Consumers is not able to predict
    when the EPA will issue a final ruling and cannot predict the
    financial impact or outcome of this matter.



CMS Energy
    Corporation

Consumers Energy
    Company

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Electric Utility Plant Air Permit Issues and Notices of
    Violation:

In 2007, Consumers received an NOV/FOV from the
    EPA alleging that fourteen utility boilers exceeded the visible
    emission limits in their associated air permits. Consumers has
    responded formally to the NOV/FOV denying the allegations. In
    addition, in 2008, Consumers received an NOV for three of its
    coal-fueled facilities alleging, among other things, violations
    of NSR PSD regulations relating to ten projects from 1986 to
    1998 allegedly subject to NSR review. The EPA has alleged that
    some utilities have classified incorrectly major plant
    modifications as RMRR rather than seeking permits from the EPA
    or state regulatory agencies to modify their plants. Consumers
    responded to the information requests from the EPA on this
    subject in the past. Consumers believes that it has properly
    interpreted the requirements of RMRR.

Consumers is engaged in discussions with the EPA on all of these
    matters. Depending upon the outcome of these discussions, the
    EPA could bring legal action against Consumers

and/or

Consumers could be required to install additional pollution
    control equipment at some or all of its coal-fueled electric
    generating plants, surrender emission allowances, engage in
    Supplemental Environmental Projects,

and/or

pay
    fines. Additionally, Consumers would need to assess the
    viability of continuing operations at certain plants. The
    potential costs relating to these matters could be material and
    the extent of cost recovery cannot be reasonably estimated.
    Although Consumers cannot predict the financial impact or
    outcome of these matters, Consumers expects that it would be
    able to recover some or all of the costs in rates, consistent
    with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with
    environmental laws and regulations.

Nuclear
    Matters:

DOE Litigation:

In 1997, a U.S. Court of
    Appeals decision confirmed that the DOE was to begin accepting
    deliveries of spent nuclear fuel for disposal by January 1998.
    Subsequent U.S. Court of Appeals litigation, in which
    Consumers and other utilities participated, has not been
    successful in producing more specific relief for the DOE’s
    failure to accept the spent nuclear fuel.

A number of court decisions support the right of utilities to
    pursue damage claims in the U.S. Court of Claims against
    the DOE for failure to take delivery of spent nuclear fuel.
    Consumers filed a complaint in 2002. If Consumers’
    litigation against the DOE is successful, Consumers plans to use
    any recoveries as reimbursement for the incurred costs of spent
    nuclear fuel storage during Consumers’ ownership of
    Palisades and Big Rock. The sale of Palisades and the Big Rock
    ISFSI did not transfer the right to any recoveries from the DOE
    related to costs of spent nuclear fuel storage incurred during
    Consumers’ ownership of Palisades and Big Rock.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Cost:

Consumers has a recorded
    liability of $163 million to fund the disposal of spent
    nuclear fuel used before 1983. This balance comprises the
    principal amount of $44 million collected from customers
    for spent nuclear fuel disposal fees and $119 million of
    interest accrued on those collections. The liability, which is
    classified in Long-term debt on CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ Consolidated Balance Sheets, is payable to the
    DOE when it begins to accept delivery of spent nuclear fuel. In
    conjunction with the sale of Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI in
    2007, Consumers retained this obligation and provided a letter
    of credit to Entergy as security for this obligation. In its
    November 2010 electric rate order, the MPSC directed Consumers
    to establish, within six months of the date of the order, an
    independent trust fund for the amount payable to the DOE. In
    December 2010, Consumers filed a Petition for Rehearing and
    Clarification, requesting that the MPSC modify its conclusion
    that this amount be placed in a trust.

Consumers’
    Gas Utility Contingencies

Gas Environmental Matters:

Consumers expects to
    incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number
    of sites under the NREPA. These sites include 23 former MGP
    facilities. Consumers operated the facilities on these sites for
    some part of their operating lives. For some of these sites,
    Consumers has no present ownership interest or may own only a
    portion of the original site. At December 31, 2010,
    Consumers estimated its undiscounted remaining remediation and
    other response activity costs to be between $31 million and



CMS Energy
    Corporation

Consumers Energy
    Company

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

$46 million. Generally, Consumers has been able to recover
    most of its costs to date through proceeds from insurance
    settlements and customer rates.

At December 31, 2010, Consumers had a recorded liability of
    $31 million and a regulatory asset of $58 million that
    included $27 million of deferred MGP expenditures. The
    timing of payments related to the remediation and other response
    activity at Consumers’ former MGP sites is uncertain.
    Consumers expects its remediation and other response activity
    costs to average $6 million annually over the next five
    years. Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. Any
    significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an
    increase in the number of sites, changes in remediation
    techniques, or legal and regulatory requirements, could affect
    Consumers’ estimates of annual response activity costs and
    the MGP liability.

(b)

At December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of CMS
    Land’s put option agreements with certain Bay Harbor
    property owners was $1 million. If CMS Land is required to
    purchase a Bay Harbor property under a put option agreement, it
    may sell the property to recover the amount paid under the put

    certain agreements. CMS Energy and Consumers consider the
    likelihood that they would be required to perform or incur
    substantial losses related to these indemnities to be remote.

Other
    Contingencies

In addition to the matters disclosed in this Note and
    Note 6, Regulatory Matters, there are certain other
    lawsuits and administrative proceedings before various courts
    and governmental agencies arising in the ordinary course of
    business to which CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain other
    subsidiaries of CMS Energy are parties. These other lawsuits and
    proceedings may involve personal injury, property damage,
    contracts, environmental issues, federal and state taxes, rates,
    licensing, employment, and other matters. Further, CMS Energy
    and Consumers occasionally self-report certain regulatory
    non-compliance matters that may or may not eventually result in
    administrative proceedings. CMS Energy and Consumers believe
    that the outcome of any one of these proceedings will not have a
    material adverse effect on their consolidated results of
    operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

Purchase obligations are long-term contracts for the purchase of
    commodities and services. These obligations include operating
    contracts used to ensure adequate supply with generating

    services include natural gas and associated transportation,
    electricity, and coal and associated transportation.

The MCV PPA:

Consumers has a

35-year

PPA
    that began in 1990 with the MCV Partnership to purchase
    1,240 MW of electricity. The MCV PPA provides for:

•

a capacity charge of $10.14 per MWh of available capacity;

•

a fixed energy charge based on Consumers’ annual average
    baseload coal generating plant operating and maintenance cost,
    fuel inventory, and average administrative and general expenses;

•

a variable energy charge for all delivered energy that reflects
    the MCV Partnership’s cost of production;

•

a $5 million annual contribution by the MCV Partnership to
    a renewable resources program; and

•

an option for Consumers to extend the MCV PPA for five years or
    purchase the MCV Facility at the conclusion of the MCV
    PPA’s term in March 2025.

Capacity and energy charges, net of RCP replacement energy and
    benefits, under the MCV PPA were $285 million in 2010,
    $246 million in 2009, and $320 million in 2008. Based
    on a 2008 contract amendment and approval by the MPSC that
    allows Consumers to manage the contract more cost effectively,
    Consumers estimates that capacity and energy charges under the
    MCV PPA will average $320 million annually. These amounts
    are included in the table above.

The Palisades PPA:

Consumers has a PPA expiring in

    produced by Palisades, up to the annual average capacity of
    798 MW. Consumers estimates that capacity and energy
    payments under the Palisades PPA will average $342 million
    annually. A portion of these amounts is included in the table
    above. Consumers’ total purchases of capacity and energy
    under the PPA were $286 million in 2010, $276 million
    in 2009, and $298 million in 2008. For further details
    about Palisades, see Note 14, Leases.

REGULATORY
    MATTERS

Rate
    Matters

Rate matters are critical to Consumers. Depending upon the
    specific issues, the outcomes of rate cases and proceedings
    could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of
    operations. Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these
    proceedings.

Consumers’
    Electric Utility

Electric Rate Cases:

The MPSC, through a final order
    and rehearing in Consumers’ 2009 electric rate case,
    directed Consumers to refund to customers the difference between
    the rates it self-implemented in May 2009 and the rates
    authorized in the order, plus interest, subject to a
    reconciliation proceeding. In August 2010, the MPSC ordered
    Consumers to refund self-implemented revenue of $16 million
    to customers. Consumers refunded this amount in September 2010.

In January 2010, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC
    seeking an annual increase in revenue of $178 million based
    on an 11 percent authorized return on equity. The filing
    requested authority to recover new investments in system
    reliability, environmental compliance, and technology
    advancements.

In July 2010, Consumers self-implemented an annual electric rate
    increase of $150 million, subject to refund with interest.
    Consumers self-implemented $28 million less than it
    originally requested in order to respond to concerns raised by
    the MPSC Staff and other intervenors and to provide a balance
    between the need for investment in Michigan’s
    infrastructure, which will support economic recovery in the
    state, and the resulting rate impacts on customers. In its July
    2010 order allowing Consumers to self-implement the
    $150 million increase, the MPSC expressed concern about
    utilities repeatedly self-implementing rate increases over short
    time periods, and before the return of previous overcollections
    of self-implemented rate increases. In August 2010, the Attorney
    General filed a claim for appeal with the Michigan Court of
    Appeals regarding the MPSC’s July 2010 order.

In November 2010, the MPSC issued its order in this case,
    authorizing Consumers to increase its rates in an annual amount
    of $146 million based on an authorized return on equity of
    10.7 percent. Presented in the following table are the
    components of the electric rate increase authorized by the MPSC
    and Consumers’ self-implemented increase:

The MPSC directed Consumers to refund to customers the
    difference between the rates it self-implemented in July 2010
    and the rates authorized in the November 2010 order, plus
    interest, subject to a reconciliation proceeding.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

In February 2011, Consumers filed an application to reconcile
    the total revenues collected under its self-implemented rates
    with those that would have been collected under the rates
    authorized by the MPSC. This reconciliation found that no refund
    is required.

Power Supply Cost Recovery:

The PSCR process is
    designed to allow Consumers to recover all of its power supply
    costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and
    practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices
    in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. Consumers adjusts
    its PSCR billing factor monthly in order to minimize the
    overrecovery or underrecovery amount in the annual PSCR
    reconciliation.

PSCR Plans:

In September 2009, Consumers submitted
    its 2010 PSCR plan to the MPSC. In accordance with its proposed
    plan, Consumers self-implemented the 2010 PSCR charge beginning
    in January 2010. In February 2011, the MPSC issued an order
    approving Consumers’ 2010 PSCR plan with the exception of
    $5 million of gas supply costs related to Zeeland.

In September 2010, Consumers submitted its 2011 PSCR plan to the
    MPSC. In accordance with its proposed plan, Consumers
    self-implemented the 2011 PSCR charge beginning in January 2011.

(a)

In 2005, the MPSC approved an economic development discount for
    a large industrial customer to promote long-term investments in
    the industrial infrastructure of Michigan. It was determined in
    the November 2009 electric rate case order that recovery of this
    discount should be provided through the electric general rates
    that Consumers self-implemented in May 2009. That order,
    however, did not address the recovery of the power-supply
    component of the discount provided from January 2009 through
    self-implementation, which totaled $4 million. Consumers
    has requested recovery of this amount through its 2009 PSCR
    reconciliation. In this reconciliation, intervenors are seeking
    disallowances ranging from $11 million to $43 million.

The MPSC issued an order in Consumers’ 2007 PSCR
    reconciliation in March 2010. In April 2010, Consumers filed for
    a rehearing in its reconciliation, asking the MPSC to reconsider
    its decision to disallow recovery of a $2 million economic
    development discount provided in 2007 to the large industrial
    customer. In June 2010, the MPSC denied Consumers’ petition
    for rehearing. In July 2010, Consumers filed a claim for appeal
    with the Michigan Court of Appeals regarding the MPSC’s
    decision to disallow recovery of the economic development
    discount. In January 2011, the Michigan Court of Appeals
    dismissed Consumers’ claim.

The MPSC issued an order in Consumers’ 2008 PSCR
    reconciliation in June 2010. In July 2010, Consumers filed for a
    rehearing in its 2008 PSCR reconciliation, asking the MPSC to
    reconsider its decision to disallow recovery of a
    $3 million economic development discount. In January 2011,
    the MPSC denied Consumers’ petition for rehearing.

Electric Operation and Maintenance Expenditures Show-Cause
    Order:

In December 2005, the MPSC authorized Consumers
    to increase its electric rates. In the same order, the MPSC
    ordered Consumers to spend certain amounts on future
    tree-trimming and line-clearing activities, as well as on the
    operation and maintenance of Consumers’ fossil-fueled power
    plants. At that time, the MPSC also ordered Consumers to
    establish mechanisms to track these expenditures and stated that
    the rate increase was subject to refund with interest if the
    specified amounts were not spent on these activities.



CMS Energy
    Corporation

Consumers Energy
    Company

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

In October 2009, the MPSC issued a show-cause order alleging
    that, in 2007, Consumers spent $14 million less on forestry
    and fossil-fueled plant operation and maintenance activity than
    the amount ordered by the MPSC and that Consumers had not
    refunded this amount to customers. The order directed Consumers
    to explain why it should not be found in violation of the
    MPSC’s December 2005 order and subjected to applicable
    sanctions, and why the refunds required by that order had not
    yet occurred. Consumers’ response indicated that the total
    amount it spent on forestry and fossil-fueled plant operation
    and maintenance activity for the years 2006 through 2009
    exceeded the total amounts included in rates for these
    activities.

In March 2010, the MPSC Staff requested that the MPSC find
    Consumers in violation of the December 2005 order and that the
    MPSC order Consumers to refund $27 million for failure to
    meet annual spending requirements during 2007 and 2008.
    Consumers filed a response, stating that it would be
    unreasonable and unlawful to order a refund of this amount and
    that Consumers’ expenditures were consistent with the
    MPSC’s orders. In March 2010, the administrative law
    judge’s proposal for decision found Consumers’
    expenditures to be prudent and that Consumers did not violate
    the December 2005 order. The administrative law judge
    recommended that the MPSC find that no violation of the December
    2005 order occurred and that no refunds be made to customers.

Electric Depreciation:

In February 2010, Consumers
    filed an electric depreciation case related to its wholly owned
    electric utility property. As ordered by the MPSC, Consumers
    prepared a traditional

cost-of-removal

study, which supported a $46 million increase in annual
    depreciation expense.

Also in February 2010, Consumers filed an electric depreciation
    case for Ludington, the pumped-storage plant jointly owned by
    Consumers and Detroit Edison. This case, filed jointly with
    Detroit Edison, requests an increase in annual depreciation
    expense. Consumers’ share of this increase is
    $9 million annually.

Wind Plant Depreciation:

In January 2011, Consumers
    filed an application with the MPSC seeking approval of
    depreciation rates for facilities to be installed in connection
    with Consumers’ plans to construct a

100-MW

wind
    farm, Lake Winds Energy Park, in Mason County, Michigan. This
    case requests an increase of $10 million in annual
    depreciation expense associated with these wind power production
    facilities.

Renewable Energy Plan:

In June 2010, Consumers filed
    its first annual report and reconciliation for its renewable
    energy plan with the MPSC, requesting approval of
    Consumers’ reconciliation of renewable energy plan costs
    for 2009.

In February 2011, Consumers filed an amended renewable energy
    plan to reduce the amount recoverable from customers. Consumers
    proposed the amendment as a result of

lower-than-anticipated

costs to comply with the renewable energy requirements
    prescribed by the 2008 Energy Legislation.

Energy Optimization Plan:

In April 2010, Consumers
    filed its first annual report and reconciliation for its energy
    optimization plan with the MPSC, requesting approval of
    Consumers’ reconciliation of energy optimization plan costs
    for 2009. Consumers also requested approval to collect
    $6 million from customers as an incentive payment for
    achieving savings targets under both its gas and electric energy
    optimization plans during 2009.

During 2010, Consumers achieved 137 percent of its electric
    savings target and 124 percent of its gas savings target.
    For achieving these savings levels, Consumers will request the
    MPSC’s approval to collect $8 million, the maximum
    incentive, in the energy optimization reconciliation to be filed
    in April 2011.

As one of the conditions to the continuation of the electric and
    gas decoupling mechanisms, Consumers must exceed the statutory
    savings targets specified in the 2008 Energy Legislation for
    2011 through 2014. In December 2010, the MPSC approved
    Consumers’ amended energy optimization plan to recover the
    additional spending necessary to exceed these savings targets.

Gas Rate Cases:

In May 2010, the MPSC authorized
    Consumers to implement an annual rate increase of
    $66 million, based on an authorized return on equity of
    10.55 percent. In December 2010, the MPSC directed
    Consumers to refund $11 million to customers for the
    difference between the rates it self-implemented in November
    2009 and the rates authorized by the MPSC in its order, plus
    interest, in January 2011.

In August 2010, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC
    seeking an annual increase in revenue of $55 million based
    on an 11 percent authorized return on equity. The filing
    requested recovery for investments made to enhance safety,
    system reliability, and operational efficiencies that improve
    service to customers. In January 2011, the MPSC Staff
    recommended a revenue increase of $5 million, based on a
    10.1 percent return on equity.

In January 2011, Consumers filed testimony and exhibits with the
    MPSC in support of a self-implemented annual gas rate increase
    of $48 million, subject to refund with interest. In
    February 2011, Consumers filed a letter with the MPSC revising
    the proposed self-implemented increase to $29 million. The
    MPSC issued an order in February 2011, delaying Consumers’
    self-implementation in order to give other parties to the
    proceeding an opportunity to respond to Consumers’ revised
    self-implementation filing.

Presented in the following table are the components of the rate
    increase recommended by the MPSC Staff and the self-implemented

Gas Cost Recovery:

The GCR process is designed to
    allow Consumers to recover all of its purchased natural gas
    costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and
    practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices
    in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. Consumers adjusts
    its GCR billing factor monthly in order to minimize the
    overrecovery or underrecovery amount in the annual GCR
    reconciliation.

GCR Plans:

In March 2010, the MPSC authorized
    Consumers to implement its

2009-2010

base GCR factor and generally approved Consumers’ plan.

In December 2010, the MPSC authorized Consumers to implement its

2010-2011

base GCR factor with certain adjustments to its purchasing
    guidelines and contingent cost recovery methodology.

In December 2010, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC
    seeking approval of its GCR plan for the

    with the provisions of regulatory accounting. A utility must
    apply regulatory accounting when its rates are designed to
    recover specific costs of providing regulated services. Under
    regulatory accounting, Consumers records regulatory assets or
    liabilities for certain transactions that would have been
    treated as expense or revenue by non-regulated businesses.

regulatory approvals under federal law. Restrictive issuance
    provisions in the First Mortgage Bond Indenture include
    achieving a two-times interest coverage ratio and having
    sufficient unfunded net property additions.

Regulatory Authorization for Financings:

FERC has
    authorized Consumers to have outstanding at any one time, up to
    $1.0 billion of secured and unsecured short-term securities
    for general corporate purposes. The remaining availability is
    $670 million at December 31, 2010. FERC has also
    authorized Consumers to issue and sell up to $1.1 billion
    of secured and unsecured long-term securities for general
    corporate purposes. The remaining availability is
    $650 million at December 31, 2010. The authorizations
    are for the period ending June 30, 2012. Any long-term
    issuances during the authorization period are exempt from
    FERC’s competitive bidding and negotiated placement
    requirements.

Securitization Bonds:

Certain regulatory assets
    owned by Consumers’ subsidiary, Consumers Funding,
    collateralize Consumers’ Securitization bonds. The
    bondholders have no recourse to Consumers’ other assets.
    Through its rate structure, Consumers bills customers for
    Securitization surcharges to fund the payment of principal,
    interest, and other related expenses. The surcharges collected
    are remitted to a trustee and are not available to creditors of
    Consumers or creditors of Consumers’ affiliates other than
    Consumers Funding. Securitization surcharges totaled
    $49 million in 2010 and $46 million in 2009.

Long-Term Debt — Related Parties:

CMS
    Energy formed a statutory wholly owned business trust for the
    sole purpose of issuing preferred securities and lending the
    gross proceeds to itself. The sole assets of the trust consist
    of 7.75 percent convertible subordinated debentures
    maturing in 2027. These debentures have terms similar to those
    of the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities the trust
    issued. Under prior accounting rules, CMS Energy did not hold
    the controlling financial interest in the trust. Accordingly, at
    December 31, 2009, CMS Energy’s obligation to the
    trust was reflected in Long-term debt — related
    parties in the amount of $34 million. Interest expense was
    $8 million in 2009 and $14 million in 2008.

Effective January 1, 2010, CMS Energy consolidated CMS
    Energy Trust I, the issuer of the Trust Preferred
    Securities. Accordingly, at December 31, 2010, the
    trust’s obligations were included on CMS Energy’s
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-term debt in the amount of
    $29 million.

Debt Maturities:

(a)

CMS Energy’s average borrowings during the year ended
    December 31, 2010, totaled $1 million, with a
    weighted-average annual interest rate of 1.0 percent, at
    LIBOR plus 0.75 percent.

(b)

Secured revolving letter of credit facility.

Short-term Borrowings:

Under Consumers’
    revolving accounts receivable sales program, Consumers may
    transfer up to $250 million of accounts receivable, subject
    to certain eligibility requirements, to a wholly owned,
    consolidated, bankruptcy-remote special-purpose entity. In turn,
    the special purpose entity may transfer an undivided interest in
    the receivables. Under accounting rules effective
    January 1, 2010, transactions entered into under this
    program are accounted for as secured borrowings rather than as
    sales. At December 31, 2010, $250 million of accounts
    receivable were eligible for transfer, and no accounts
    receivable had been transferred under the program. Prior to
    2010, Consumers accounted for these transfers as sales. At
    December 31, 2009, $250 million of accounts receivable
    were eligible for sale, of which $50 million were sold.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, Consumers’
    maximum short-term borrowings totaled $50 million, and its
    average short-term borrowings totaled $1 million, with a
    weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.2 percent.

The holders of the 2.875 percent senior notes have the
    right to require CMS Energy to purchase the notes at par on
    December 1, 2011, 2014, and 2019.

The securities become convertible for a calendar quarter if the
    price of CMS Energy’s common stock remains at or above the
    trigger price for 20 of 30 consecutive trading days ending on
    the last trading day of the previous quarter. The trigger price
    at which these securities become convertible is 120 percent
    of the conversion price for the 2.875 percent senior notes
    and 130 percent for the 5.5 percent senior notes. The
    conversion and trigger prices are subject to adjustment in
    certain circumstances, including payments or distributions to
    CMS Energy’s common stockholders. The conversion and
    trigger price adjustment is made when the cumulative change in
    conversion and trigger prices is one percent or more. During
    December 2010, trigger price contingencies were met for the
    2.875 percent senior notes.

All of CMS Energy’s contingently convertible securities, if
    converted, require CMS Energy to pay cash up to the principal
    amount of the securities. Any conversion value in excess of that
    amount is paid in shares of CMS Energy’s common stock.

(a)

In September 2010, CMS Energy exercised its mandatory conversion
    rights for all of its outstanding 4.50 percent cumulative
    convertible preferred stock. Also in September 2010, holders
    voluntarily tendered 633,971 shares of the
    4.50 percent cumulative convertible preferred stock for
    conversion. In October 2010, CMS Energy paid $226 million
    in cash and issued 13,110,733 shares of its common stock
    upon conversion of 4,518,900 shares of its
    4.50 percent cumulative convertible preferred stock.

(b)

In December 2010, CMS Energy called all of its outstanding
    3.375 percent contingently convertible senior notes for
    redemption. In response to the call, holders voluntarily
    tendered $128 million aggregate principal amount of the
    notes for conversion in December 2010. In December 2010, holders
    also voluntarily tendered $4 million aggregate principal
    amount of the notes for conversion in January 2011. The
    conversion value per $1,000 principal amount of convertible
    notes was $1,994.21. In January 2011, CMS Energy paid
    $4 million in cash and issued 197,472 shares of its
    common stock in exchange for the $4 million aggregate
    principal amount of notes tendered.

Dividend Restrictions:

Under provisions of CMS
    Energy’s senior notes indenture, at December 31, 2010,
    payment of common stock dividends by CMS Energy was limited to
    $959 million.

Under the provisions of its articles of incorporation, at
    December 31, 2010, Consumers had $404 million of
    unrestricted retained earnings available to pay common stock
    dividends to CMS Energy. Provisions of the Federal Power Act and
    the Natural Gas Act appear to restrict dividends payable by
    Consumers to the amount of Consumers’ retained earnings.
    Several decisions from FERC suggest that under a variety of
    circumstances common stock dividends from Consumers would not be
    limited to amounts in Consumers’ retained earnings. Any
    decision by Consumers to pay common stock dividends in excess of
    retained earnings would be based on specific facts and
    circumstances and would result only after a formal regulatory
    filing process.

During 2010, CMS Energy received $358 million of common
    stock dividends from Consumers.

Contingently Convertible Securities:

When CMS Energy
    has earnings from continuing operations, its contingently
    convertible securities dilute EPS to the extent that the
    conversion value of a security, which is based on the average
    market price of CMS Energy’s common stock, exceeds the
    principal value of that security.

In September 2010, CMS Energy exercised its mandatory conversion
    rights for all of its outstanding 4.50 percent cumulative
    convertible preferred stock and charged unamortized issuance
    costs of $8 million to Charge for Deferred Issuance Costs
    on Preferred Stock, in Accumulated Deficit, which reduced Net
    Income Available to Common Stockholders on its Consolidated
    Statements of Income. In October 2010, CMS Energy



CMS Energy
    Corporation

Consumers Energy
    Company

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

issued 11,276,277 shares of its common stock upon
    conversion. For additional details on contingently convertible
    securities, see Note 7, Financings and Capitalization.

Stock Options and Warrants:

For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, outstanding options to purchase
    0.4 million shares of CMS Energy common stock had no impact
    on diluted EPS, since the exercise price was greater than the
    average market price of CMS Energy common stock. These stock
    options have the potential to dilute EPS in the future.

Non-vested Stock Awards:

CMS Energy’s
    non-vested stock awards are composed of participating and
    non-participating securities. The participating securities
    accrue cash dividends when common stockholders receive
    dividends. Since the recipient is not required to return the
    dividends to CMS Energy if the recipient forfeits the award, the
    non-vested stock awards are considered participating securities.
    As such, the participating non-vested stock awards were included
    in the computation of basic EPS. The non-participating
    securities accrue stock dividends that vest concurrently with
    the stock award. If the recipient forfeits the award, the stock
    dividends accrued on the non-participating securities are also
    forfeited. Accordingly, the non-participating awards and stock
    dividends were included in the computation of diluted EPS, but
    not basic EPS.

Convertible Debentures:

For the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, there was no impact on
    diluted EPS from CMS Energy’s 7.75 percent convertible
    subordinated debentures. Using the if-converted method, the
    debentures would have:

•

increased the numerator of diluted EPS by $1 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2010, by $5 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2009, and by $9 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008, from an assumed
    reduction of interest expense, net of tax; and

•

increased the denominator of diluted EPS by 0.7 million
    shares for the year ended December 31, 2010, by
    2.3 million shares for the year ended December 31,
    2009, and by 4.2 million shares for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

CMS Energy can revoke the conversion rights if certain
    conditions are met.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Notes receivable consist of EnerBank’s fixed-rate
    installment loans. EnerBank estimates the fair value of these
    loans using a discounted cash flows technique that incorporates
    market interest rates as well as assumptions about the remaining
    life of the loans and credit risk. Fair values for impaired
    loans are estimated using discounted cash flows or underlying
    collateral values.

CMS Energy and Consumers estimate the fair value of their
    long-term debt using quoted prices from market trades of the
    debt, if available. In the absence of quoted prices, CMS Energy
    and Consumers calculate market yields and prices for the debt
    using a matrix method that incorporates market data for
    similarly rated debt. Depending on the information available,
    other valuation techniques may be used that rely on internal
    assumptions and models. CMS Energy includes the value of the
    conversion features in estimating the fair value of its
    convertible debt, and incorporates, as appropriate, information
    on the market prices of CMS Energy’s common stock.

The effects of third-party credit enhancements are excluded from
    the fair value measurements of long-term debt. At
    December 31, 2010, CMS Energy’s long-term debt
    included $103 million principal amount that was supported
    by third-party credit enhancements. This entire principal amount
    was at Consumers. At December 31, 2009, CMS Energy’s
    long-term debt included $286 million principal amount that
    was supported by third-party insurance or other credit
    enhancements. Of this amount, $271 million principal amount
    was at Consumers.

    during the year ended December 31, 2010. State and
    municipal bonds classified as available for sale consist of
    investment grade state and municipal bonds. Debt securities
    classified as held to maturity consist primarily of
    mortgage-backed securities held by EnerBank, as well as state
    and municipal bonds held by EnerBank.

The amounts for all periods represent sales of SERP securities
    classified as available for sale. The activity during 2009
    related primarily to the sale of a SERP investment in a mutual
    fund, while the remainder of the activity for all three years
    related to sales of state and municipal bonds held within the
    SERP.

During 2008, the fair value of CMS Energy’s SERP investment
    in a mutual fund declined from $63 million to
    $39 million. These amounts include the decline in fair
    value of Consumers’ SERP investment in the mutual fund from
    $41 million to $25 million. CMS Energy and Consumers
    determined that these declines in fair value were other than
    temporary. Accordingly, CMS Energy recognized net unrealized
    losses of $24 million ($15 million net of tax) in
    Other expense on its Consolidated Statements of Income.
    Consumers recognized net unrealized losses of $16 million
    ($10 million net of tax) in Other expense on its
    Consolidated Statements of Income. These losses had been
    recorded in AOCI, in accordance with applicable accounting
    standards, before they were determined to be other than

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS

In order to limit exposure to certain market risks, primarily
    changes in commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign
    exchange rates, CMS Energy and Consumers may enter into various
    risk management contracts, such as forward contracts, futures,
    options, and swaps. In entering into these contracts, they
    follow established policies and procedures under the direction
    of an executive oversight committee consisting of senior
    management



CMS Energy
    Corporation

Consumers Energy
    Company

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

representatives and a risk committee consisting of business unit
    managers. Neither CMS Energy nor Consumers enters into any
    derivatives for trading purposes.

The contracts used to manage market risks may qualify as
    derivative instruments. If a contract is a derivative and does
    not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, the
    contract is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value.
    Each reporting period, the resulting asset or liability is
    adjusted to reflect any change in the fair value of the
    contract. Since none of CMS Energy’s or Consumers’
    derivatives have been designated as accounting hedges, all
    changes in fair value are reported in earnings.

For a discussion of how CMS Energy and Consumers determine the
    fair value of their derivatives, see Note 4, Fair Value
    Measurements.

Commodity Price Risk:

In order to support ongoing
    operations, CMS Energy and Consumers enter into contracts for
    the future purchase and sale of various commodities, such as
    electricity, natural gas, and coal. These forward contracts are
    generally long-term in nature and result in physical delivery of
    the commodity at a contracted price. Most of these contracts are
    not subject to derivative accounting because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units
    specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity
    or bcf of natural gas);

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales
    exception; or

•

there is not an active market for the commodity.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ coal purchase contracts
    are not derivatives because there is not an active market for
    the coal they purchase. If an active market for coal develops in
    the future, some of these contracts may qualify as derivatives.
    For Consumers, which is subject to regulatory accounting, the
    resulting fair value gains and losses would be offset by changes
    in regulatory assets and liabilities and would not affect net
    income. No other subsidiaries of CMS Energy enter into coal
    purchase contracts.

CMS ERM has not designated its contracts to purchase and sell
    electricity and natural gas as normal purchases and sales and,
    therefore, CMS Energy accounts for those contracts as
    derivatives. To manage commodity price risks associated with
    these forward purchase and sale contracts, CMS ERM uses various
    financial instruments, such as futures, options, and swaps. At
    December 31, 2010, CMS ERM held the following derivative
    contracts:

•

a forward contract for the physical sale of 675 GWh of
    electricity through 2015 on behalf of one of CMS Energy’s
    non-utility generating plants;

•

futures contracts through 2011 as an economic hedge of
    20 percent of the generating plant’s natural gas
    requirements needed to serve a steam sales contract, for a total
    of 0.2 bcf of natural gas;

•

a forward contract for the physical sale of 50 GWh of
    electricity in January 2011;

•

forward contracts to purchase 2.1 bcf and sell 2.1 bcf of
    natural gas through October 2011 in CMS ERM’s role as a
    marketer of natural gas for third-party producers; and

•

an option to sell 612 GWh of electricity, and as an economic
    hedge, contracts to purchase 0.8 bcf of natural gas through 2011.

(a)

This derivative loss relates to a foreign-exchange forward
    contract that CMS Energy settled in January 2009.

CMS Energy’s derivative liabilities subject to
    credit-risk-related contingent features were $1 million at
    December 31, 2010 and less than $1 million at
    December 31, 2009.

Credit Risk:

CMS Energy’s swaps, options, and
    forward contracts contain credit risk, which is the risk that a
    counterparty will fail to meet its contractual obligations. CMS
    Energy reduces this risk through established policies and
    procedures. CMS Energy assesses credit quality by considering
    credit ratings, financial condition, and other available
    information for counterparties. A credit limit is established
    for each counterparty based on the evaluation of its credit
    quality. Exposure to potential loss under each contract is
    monitored and action is taken when appropriate.

CMS ERM enters into contracts primarily with companies in the
    electric and gas industry. This industry concentration may have
    a positive or negative impact on CMS Energy’s exposure to
    credit risk based on how similar changes in economic conditions,
    the weather, or other conditions affect these counterparties.
    CMS ERM reduces its credit risk exposure by using
    industry-standard agreements that allow for netting positive and
    negative exposures associated with the same counterparty.
    Typically, these agreements also allow each party to demand
    adequate assurance of future performance from the other party,
    when there is reason to do so.

At December 31, 2010, if counterparties within this
    industry concentration all failed to meet their contractual
    obligations, the loss to CMS Energy on contracts accounted for
    as derivatives would be less than $1 million.

CMS Energy does not expect a material adverse effect on its
    Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
    Income as a result of counterparty nonperformance, given CMS
    Energy’s credit policies, current exposures, and credit
    reserves.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

CMS Energy and Consumers provide pension, OPEB, and other
    retirement benefits to employees under a number of different
    plans. These plans include:

•

a non-contributory, qualified defined benefit Pension Plan
    (closed to new non-union participants as of July 1, 2003
    and closed to new union participants as of September 1,
    2005);

•

a qualified cash balance Pension Plan for certain employees
    hired between July 1, 2003 and August 31, 2005;

•

a non-contributory, qualified DCCP for employees hired on or
    after September 1, 2005;

•

benefits to certain management employees under a
    non-contributory, nonqualified defined benefit SERP (closed to
    new participants as of March 31, 2006);

•

a non-contributory, nonqualified DC SERP for certain management
    employees hired or promoted on or after April 1, 2006;

•

health care and life insurance benefits under an OPEB plan;

•

benefits to a selected group of management under a
    non-contributory, nonqualified EISP; and

•

a contributory, qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan.

Pension Plan:

Participants in the Pension Plan
    include CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ present employees,
    employees of their subsidiaries, and employees of Panhandle, a
    former CMS Energy subsidiary. Pension Plan trust assets are not
    distinguishable by company.

CMS Energy and Consumers provide an employer contribution of
    five percent of base pay to the DCCP 401(k) plan for employees
    hired on or after September 1, 2005. On January 1,
    2011, the employer contribution was increased to six percent.
    Employees are not required to contribute in order to receive the
    plan’s employer contribution.

Participants in the cash balance Pension Plan, effective
    July 1, 2003 to September 1, 2005, also participate in
    the DCCP as of September 1, 2005. Additional pay credits
    under the cash balance Pension Plan were discontinued as of
    September 1, 2005. DCCP expense for CMS Energy and
    Consumers was $5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010, $4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, and $3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

SERP:

The SERP is a non-qualified plan as defined by
    the Internal Revenue Code. SERP benefits are paid from a trust
    established in 1988. SERP trust earnings are taxable. Presented
    in the following table are the funded status and fair value of
    trust assets for CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ SERP:

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

On April 1, 2006, CMS Energy and Consumers implemented a DC
    SERP and froze further new participation in the SERP. The DC
    SERP provides participants benefits ranging from 5 percent
    to 15 percent of total compensation. The DC SERP requires a
    minimum of five years of participation before vesting. CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ contributions to the plan, if
    any, are placed in a grantor trust. For CMS Energy and
    Consumers, trust assets were less than $1 million at
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. DC SERP
    assets are included in Other non-current assets on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ DC SERP expense was less
    than $1 million for each of the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008.

401(k):

The 401(k) plan employer match equals
    60 percent of eligible contributions up to the first six
    percent of an employee’s wages. The total 401(k) plan cost
    for CMS Energy, including Consumers, was $16 million for
    each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008.
    The total 401(k) plan cost for Consumers was $15 million
    for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and
    2008.

EISP:

In 2002, CMS Energy and Consumers implemented
    a nonqualified EISP to provide flexibility in separation of
    employment by officers, a selected group of management, or other
    highly compensated employees. Terms of the plan include payment
    of a lump sum, payment of monthly benefits for life, payment of
    premiums for continuation of health care, or any other legally
    permissible term deemed to be in CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ best interest. EISP expense for CMS Energy and
    Consumers was less than $1 million for each of the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. The ABO for the
    EISP for CMS Energy, including Consumers, was $5 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $4 million at December 31,
    2009. The ABO for the EISP for Consumers was $1 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

OPEB:

Participants in the OPEB plan include all
    regular full-time employees covered by the employee health care
    plan on the day before retirement from either CMS Energy or
    Consumers at age 55 or older with at least ten full years
    of applicable continuous service. Regular full-time employees
    who qualify for Pension Plan disability retirement and have
    15 years of applicable continuous service may also
    participate in the OPEB plan. Retiree health care costs were
    based on the assumption that costs would increase
    8.0 percent in 2011 for all retirees. In 2010, the
    assumption was 8.5 percent for those under 65 and
    8.0 percent for those over 65. The rate of increase was
    assumed to decline to five percent for all retirees by 2017 and
    thereafter.

The assumptions used in the health care cost-trend rate affect
    service, interest, and PBO costs. Presented in the following
    table are the effects of a one-percentage-point change in the
    health care cost-trend assumption:

In 1992, Consumers recorded a liability of $466 million for
    the accumulated transition obligation and a corresponding
    regulatory asset for anticipated recovery in utility rates. The
    MPSC authorized recovery of the electric utility portion of
    these costs in 1994 over 18 years and the gas utility
    portion in 1996 over 16 years.

(a)

Regulatory adjustments are the differences between amounts
    included in rates and the periodic benefit cost calculated.
    These regulatory adjustments were offset by surcharge revenues,
    which resulted in no impact to net income for the years
    presented. The pension and OPEB regulatory liability was less
    than $1 million at December 31, 2010. The pension and
    OPEB regulatory asset was $34 million at December 31,
    2009.

The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined
    benefit Pension Plans that will be amortized into net periodic
    benefit cost in 2011 for CMS Energy from the regulatory asset is
    $66 million and from AOCI is $2 million. The estimated
    net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit Pension
    Plans that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost in
    2011 for Consumers from the regulatory asset is
    $66 million. The estimated net loss and prior service
    credit for OPEB plans that will be amortized into net periodic
    benefit cost in 2011 for CMS Energy from the regulatory asset is
    $21 million, with a decrease from AOCI of $1 million.
    The estimated net loss and prior service credit for OPEB plans
    that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost in 2011
    for Consumers from the regulatory asset is $21 million.

CMS Energy and Consumers amortize net gains and losses in excess
    of ten percent of the greater of the PBO or the MRV over the
    average remaining service period. The estimated time of
    amortization of gains and losses for CMS Energy and Consumers
    was 12 years for pension and 14 years for OPEB for
    each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008.
    Prior service cost amortization is established in the year in
    which the prior service cost first

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

occurred, and is based on the same amortization period for all
    future years until the prior service costs are fully amortized.
    The estimated time of amortization of new prior service costs
    for CMS Energy and Consumers was 12 years for pension and
    ten years for OPEB for each of the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009, and 2008.

CMS Energy, including Consumers, plans to contribute

    contribute $64 million to the OPEB plan in 2011.

(b)

CMS Energy, including Consumers, does not plan to contribute to
    the Pension Plan in 2011.

Contributions include required and discretionary amounts. Actual
    future contributions will depend on future investment
    performance, changes in discount rates, and various factors
    related to the populations participating in the plans.

In 2008, CMS Energy adjusted its target asset allocation for
    Pension Plan assets to 50 percent equity, 30 percent
    fixed income, and 20 percent alternative-strategy
    investments. This adjustment is being made gradually by the
    allocation of contributions into alternative assets and the
    drawdown of equities to cover plan benefit payments and
    distributions. This revised target asset allocation is expected
    to continue to maximize the long-term return on plan assets,
    while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of
    acceptable risk is a function of the liabilities of the plan.
    Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S&P
    500 Index, with lesser allocations to the S&P MidCap and
    SmallCap Indexes and Foreign Equity Funds. Fixed-income
    investments are diversified across investment grade instruments
    of government and corporate issuers as well as high-yield and
    global bond funds. Alternative strategies are diversified across
    absolute return investment approaches and global tactical asset
    allocation. CMS Energy and Consumers use annual liability
    measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic
    asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to
    the portfolio allocation.

CMS Energy and Consumers established union and non-union VEBA
    trusts to fund their future retiree health and life insurance
    benefits. These trusts are funded through the ratemaking process
    for Consumers and through direct contributions from the
    non-utility subsidiaries. CMS Energy and Consumers have a target
    asset allocation of 60 percent equity and 40 percent
    fixed-income investments.

CMS Energy and Consumers invest the equity portions of the union
    and non-union health care VEBA trusts in an S&P 500 Index
    fund. CMS Energy and Consumers invest the fixed-income portion
    of the union health care VEBA trust in domestic investment grade
    taxable instruments. CMS Energy and Consumers invest the
    fixed-income portion of the non-union health care VEBA trust in
    a diversified mix of domestic tax-exempt securities. The



CMS Energy
    Corporation

Consumers Energy
    Company

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

investment selections of each VEBA trust are influenced by the
    tax consequences, as well as the objective of generating asset
    returns that will meet the medical and life insurance costs of
    retirees.

    Consumers, subsidies to be received are estimated to be
    $6 million for 2011 and 2012, $7 million for 2013 and
    2014, $8 million for 2015, and $49 million combined
    for 2016 through 2020.

Collective Bargaining Agreements:

At
    December 31, 2010, the Union represented 42 percent of
    CMS Energy’s employees and 44 percent of
    Consumers’ employees. The Union represents Consumers’
    operating, maintenance, construction, and call center employees.
    Union contracts expire in 2015. In October 2010, the United
    Steelworkers ratified a new agreement with Consumers for Zeeland
    employees, which became effective in January 2011.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, the
    Health Care Acts prospectively repealed the tax deduction for
    the portion of health care costs that are reimbursed by the
    Medicare Part D subsidy. To reflect the law change, CMS
    Energy recognized deferred tax expense of $3 million during
    2010. Consumers expects to recover this lost benefit through the
    ratemaking process and therefore continued to recognize the tax
    benefit during 2010. The total anticipated recovery was recorded
    as a regulatory asset of $74 million (not including the
    effects of ratemaking tax gross-ups) at December 31, 2010.

CMS Energy

Consumers Energy
    Company

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

CMS Energy, including Consumers, had uncertain tax benefits of
    $4 million at December 31, 2010, $8 million at
    December 31, 2009, and $10 million at
    December 31, 2008 that, if recognized, would affect the
    annual effective tax rate in future years. Consumers had
    uncertain tax benefits of $3 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009. There were no uncertain tax benefits that would
    reduce Consumers’ effective tax rate at December 31,
    2008.

CMS Energy and Consumers recognize accrued interest and
    penalties, where applicable, as part of income tax expense. CMS
    Energy, including Consumers, recognized no interest for the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and $1 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008. In 2010, CMS Energy
    settled with the IRS and, as a result, paid $6 million of
    accrued interest in December. At that time, a remaining accrued
    interest balance of $3 million was eliminated. Consumers
    recognized no interest for the years ended December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and $1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Upon settlement with the IRS, Consumers
    paid $4 million to CMS Energy and eliminated a remaining
    accrued interest balance of $1 million.

In November 2010, the IRS concluded its most recent audit of CMS
    Energy and its subsidiaries, and proposed changes of
    $132 million to taxable income for the years ended
    December 31, 2002 through December 31, 2007. Of this
    amount, $82 million resulted in an adjustment to the
    existing net operating loss carryforward; the remaining
    $50 million increased taxable income. Most of the
    adjustments related to the timing of deductions, not the
    disallowance of deductions. CMS Energy accepted the proposed
    adjustments to taxable income, which resulted in the payment of
    $15 million of tax and accrued interest. The tax
    adjustments were allocated based on the companies’ separate
    taxable income, in accordance with CMS Energy’s tax sharing
    agreement. The impact to net income was less than
    $1 million.

In December 2010, the IRS began its audit of CMS Energy and its
    subsidiaries’ 2008 and 2009 federal tax returns. The IRS
    also is auditing CMS Energy’s research and development tax
    credit claims for 2001 through 2009. These credits are part of
    CMS Energy’s overall general business credit carryforward.
    It is reasonably possible that, within the next twelve months, a
    settlement will be reached with the IRS on CMS Energy’s
    research and development tax credit claim. The total claimed
    credit is $21 million.

The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by
    federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in
    proposed assessments. CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is
    highly judgmental. CMS Energy and Consumers believe that their
    accrued tax liabilities at December 31, 2010 were adequate
    for all years.

13:

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

CMS Energy and Consumers provide a PISP to key employees and
    non-employee directors based on their contributions to the
    successful management of the company. The PISP has a five-year
    term, expiring in May 2014.

All grants under the PISP for 2010, 2009, and 2008 were in the
    form of TSR restricted stock and time-lapse restricted stock.
    Restricted stock recipients receive shares of CMS Energy common
    stock. Restricted stock shares granted prior to August 1,
    2010 have full dividend and voting rights. The TSR restricted
    stock shares granted in 2010 have full voting rights. In lieu of
    cash dividend payments, however, the TSR restricted stock shares
    granted in 2010 receive additional restricted shares equal to
    the value of the dividend. These additional restricted shares
    are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying
    restricted stock shares.

TSR restricted stock vesting is contingent on meeting a
    three-year service requirement and specific market conditions.
    For awards granted in 2008, half of the market condition is
    based on the achievement of specified levels of TSR over a
    three-year period and half is based on a comparison of CMS
    Energy’s TSR with the median TSR of a peer group over the
    same three-year period. Depending on the outcome of the market
    condition, a recipient may earn a total award ranging from zero
    to 150 percent of the initial grant. For awards granted in
    2010 and 2009, the market condition is based entirely on a
    comparison of CMS Energy’s TSR with the median TSR of a
    peer group over the same three-year period. Depending on the
    outcome of the market condition, a recipient may earn a total
    award



CMS Energy
    Corporation

Consumers Energy
    Company

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

ranging from zero to 200 percent of the initial grant.
    Time-lapse restricted stock vests after a service period of
    three years.

Restricted stock awards granted to officers in 2008 were
    80 percent TSR restricted stock and 20 percent
    time-lapsed restricted stock. Awards granted to officers in 2010
    and 2009 were 67 percent TSR restricted stock and
    33 percent time-lapse restricted stock.

For awards granted prior to August 1, 2010, restricted
    shares may vest fully upon retirement, disability, or change of
    control of CMS Energy if certain minimum service requirements
    are met or are waived by action of the C&HR Committees. If
    employment terminates for any other reason (other than death) or
    the minimum service requirements are not met or waived, the
    restricted shares will be fully forfeited. For awards granted
    after August 1, 2010, a pro-rata portion of the award equal
    to the portion of the service period served between the award
    grant date and the employee’s termination date will vest
    upon termination of an employee due to retirement, disability,
    or change of control of CMS Energy. The remaining portion of the
    award will be forfeited. All awards vest fully upon death.

The PISP also allows for stock options, stock appreciation
    rights, phantom shares, performance units, and incentive
    options, none of which was granted in 2010, 2009, or 2008.

Shares awarded or subject to stock options, phantom shares, or
    performance units may not exceed 6 million shares from June
    2009 through May 2014, nor may such awards to any recipient
    exceed 500,000 shares in any fiscal year. CMS Energy and
    Consumers may issue awards of up to 4,650,719 shares of
    common stock under the PISP at December 31, 2010. Shares
    for which payment or exercise is in cash, as well as shares or
    stock options forfeited for any reason other than failure to
    meet a market condition, may be awarded or granted again under
    the PISP.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

CMS Energy and Consumers charge the fair value of the awards to
    expense over the required service period. As a result, for
    awards granted prior to August 1, 2010, CMS Energy and
    Consumers recognize all compensation expense for share-based
    awards that have accelerated service provisions upon retirement
    by the period in which the employee becomes eligible to retire.
    TSR restricted stock awards granted after August 1, 2010
    have graded vesting features, and CMS Energy and Consumers
    recognize expense for those awards on a graded vesting schedule
    over the required service period. Expense for time-lapse awards
    is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service
    period. CMS Energy and Consumers calculate the fair value
    of time-lapse restricted stock based on the price of CMS
    Energy’s common stock on the grant date. CMS Energy and
    Consumers calculate the fair value of TSR restricted stock
    awards on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. CMS
    Energy and Consumers base expected volatilities on the
    historical volatility of the price of CMS Energy common stock.

The risk-free rate for each valuation was based on the
    three-year U.S. Treasury yield at the award grant date.

Stock options give the holder the right to purchase common stock
    at the market price on the grant date. Stock options are
    exercisable upon grant, and expire up to ten years and one month
    from the grant date. CMS Energy and Consumers issue new shares
    when recipients exercise stock options. The total intrinsic
    value of stock options exercised for CMS Energy was
    $1 million in 2010, less than $1 million in 2009, and
    $1 million in 2008. The total intrinsic value of stock options
    exercised for Consumers was $1 million in 2010 and less
    than $1 million in 2009 and 2008. Cash received from
    exercise of these stock options in 2010 was less than
    $1 million for CMS Energy and Consumers.

Since CMS Energy has utilized tax loss carryforwards, CMS Energy
    was unable to realize excess tax benefits upon exercise of stock
    options and vesting of restricted stock. Therefore, CMS Energy
    did not recognize the related excess tax benefits in equity. As
    of December 31, 2010, CMS Energy has $20 million of
    unrealized excess tax benefits.

Operating leases for coal-carrying railcars have lease terms
    expiring without extension provisions over the next
    13 years and with extension provisions over the next
    16 years. These leases contain fair market value extension
    and buyout provisions, with some providing for predetermined
    extension period rentals. Capital leases for Consumers’
    vehicle fleet operations have a maximum term of 120 months
    with some having Terminal Rental Adjustment Clause

end-of-life

provisions and others having fixed percentage purchase options.

Consumers has capital leases for gas transportation pipelines to
    the Karn generating complex and Zeeland. The capital lease for
    the gas transportation pipeline into the Karn generating complex
    has a term of 15 years with a provision to extend the
    contract from month to month. The remaining term of the contract
    was 11 years at December 31, 2010. The capital lease
    for the gas transportation pipeline to Zeeland has a term of
    12 years with a renewal provision at the end of the
    contract. The remaining term of the contract was one year at
    December 31, 2010. The remaining terms of Consumers’
    long-term PPAs range between two and 20 years. Most of
    these PPAs contain provisions at the end of the initial contract
    terms to renew the agreements annually.

Consumers is authorized by the MPSC to record operating lease
    payments as operating expense and recover the total cost from

In 2007, Consumers sold Palisades to Entergy and entered into a

15-year

PPA
    to buy all of the capacity and energy then capable of being
    produced by Palisades. Consumers has continuing involvement with
    Palisades through security provided to Entergy for
    Consumers’ PPA obligation, Consumers’ DOE liability,
    and other forms of involvement. Because of these ongoing
    arrangements, Consumers accounted for the transaction as a
    financing of Palisades and not a sale. Accordingly, no gain on
    the sale of Palisades was recognized on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. Consumers accounted for the remaining
    non-real-estate assets and liabilities associated with the
    transaction as a sale.

Palisades remains on Consumers’ Consolidated Balance Sheets
    and Consumers continues to depreciate it. Consumers recorded the
    related proceeds as a finance obligation with payments recorded
    to interest expense and the finance obligation based on the
    amortization of the obligation over the life of the Palisades
    PPA. The value of the finance obligation was determined based on
    an allocation of the transaction proceeds to the fair values of
    the net assets sold and fair value of the plant asset under the
    financing. Total amortization and interest charges under the
    financing were $22 million and $23 million,
    respectively, for each of the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009.

ASSET RETIREMENT
    OBLIGATIONS

CMS Energy and Consumers record the fair value of the cost to
    remove assets at the end of their useful lives, if there is a
    legal obligation to remove them. No market risk premiums were
    included in CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ ARO fair value
    estimates since reasonable estimates could not be made. If a
    five percent market risk premium were assumed, CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ ARO liabilities at December 31, 2010
    would increase by $12 million and at December 31, 2009
    would increase by $11 million, respectively.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the
    period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with
    indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. CMS Energy and
    Consumers have not recorded liabilities for assets that have
    insignificant cumulative disposal costs, such as substation
    batteries.

Presented below are the categories of assets that CMS Energy and
    Consumers have legal obligations to remove at the end of their

(a)

Net investment is the amount of utility plant in service less
    accumulated depreciation.

Consumers includes its share of the direct expenses of the
    jointly owned plants in Operating Expenses. Consumers shares
    operation, maintenance, and other expenses of these jointly
    owned utility facilities in proportion to each
    participant’s undivided ownership interest. Consumers is
    required to provide only its share of financing for the jointly
    owned utility facilities.

18:

VARIABLE INTEREST
    ENTITIES

Entities that are VIEs must be consolidated if the reporting
    entity determines that it has a controlling financial interest.
    The entity that is required to consolidate the VIE is called the
    primary beneficiary. Variable interests are contractual,
    ownership, or other interests in an entity that change as the
    fair value of the VIE’s net assets, excluding variable
    interests, changes. An entity is considered to be a VIE when its
    capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities
    without additional subordinated financial support or its equity
    investors, as a group, lack the characteristics of having a
    controlling financial interest.

Effective January 1, 2010, the accounting standards for
    consolidation of VIEs were amended. The most significant
    amendment changed the criteria for identifying the primary
    beneficiary. Under the amended standard, the primary beneficiary
    is the entity that has both (1) the power to direct the
    activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the
    VIE’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to
    absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant
    to the VIE.

As a result of adopting this amendment, effective
    January 1, 2010, CMS Energy has consolidated CMS Energy
    Trust I and deconsolidated three partnerships that it had
    previously consolidated.

CMS Energy has consolidated CMS Energy Trust I because CMS
    Energy is the variable interest holder that designed the entity
    and, through the design, has the power to direct the activities
    of CMS Energy Trust I that most significantly impact the
    trust’s economic performance. CMS Energy has guaranteed
    payment of the Trust Preferred Securities. The sole assets
    of the trust consist of subordinated notes issued by CMS Energy,
    and the sole liabilities of the trust consist of
    Trust Preferred Securities. Upon consolidation, CMS Energy
    reduced its equity method investment by $5 million and its
    Long-term debt by $34 million. CMS Energy also recorded a
    $29 million liability for the mandatorily redeemable
    preferred securities issued by the trust. No gain or loss was
    recognized on the consolidation of CMS Energy Trust I.

CMS Energy has deconsolidated T.E.S. Filer City, Grayling, and
    Genesee because CMS Energy determined that power is shared among
    unrelated parties, and that no one party has the power to direct
    the activities that most significantly impact the entities’
    economic performance. The partners must agree on all major
    decisions for each of the partnerships. As a result, CMS Energy
    is not the primary beneficiary of these partnerships.

    partnerships:

T.E.S. Filer City (50%)

Coal-fueled power generator

Non-recourse long-term debt that matured in December 2007.

Grayling (50%)

Wood waste-fueled  power generator

Sale of revenue bonds that mature in November 2012 and bear
    interest at variable rates.  The debt is recourse to the
    partnership, but not the individual partners, and secured by a
    letter of credit equal to the outstanding balance.

Genesee (50%)

Wood waste-fueled  power generator

Sale of revenue bonds that mature in 2021 and bear interest at
    fixed rates.  The debt is non-recourse to the partnership and
    secured by a CMS Energy guarantee capped at $3 million annually.

CMS Energy has operating and management contracts with Grayling
    and Genesee, and Consumers is the primary purchaser of power
    from each partnership through long-term PPAs. Consumers also has
    reduced dispatch agreements with Grayling and Genesee, which
    allow these facilities to be dispatched based on the market
    price of wood waste. This results in fuel cost savings that each
    partnership shares with Consumers’ customers.

CMS Energy’s investment in these partnerships is included
    in Investments on its Consolidated Balance Sheets in the amount
    of $49 million as of December 31, 2010. The
    partnerships were consolidated at December 31, 2009. Total
    assets of the partnerships were $189 million and total
    liabilities were $92 million at December 31, 2009. The
    partnerships had third-party debt obligations totaling
    $70 million at December 31, 2009. Plant, property, and
    equipment serving as collateral for these obligations had a
    carrying value of $137 million at December 31, 2009.
    The creditors of these partnerships do not have recourse to the
    general credit of CMS Energy or Consumers, except through a
    guarantee provided by CMS Energy of $3 million annually.
    CMS Energy has deferred collections on certain receivables owed
    by Genesee. CMS Energy’s maximum exposure to loss from
    these receivables is $6 million. Consumers has not provided
    any financial or other support during the periods presented that
    was not previously contractually required.

Asset
    Sales

The impacts of asset sales are included in Gain on asset sales,
    net and Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations in CMS
    Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income, and they are
    included in Loss (gain) on asset sales, net in Consumers’
    Consolidated Statements of Income. Asset sales for CMS Energy
    and Consumers were immaterial for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008.

In connection with the sale of CMS Energy’s Argentine and
    Michigan assets to Lucid Energy in 2007, CMS Energy entered into
    agreements that granted MEI, an affiliate of Lucid Energy, the
    right to any proceeds from an assignment of an arbitration award
    associated with TGN. The agreements also granted MEI an option
    to purchase CMS Gas Transmission’s ownership interests in
    TGN, and the rights to any proceeds CMS Enterprises would
    receive if it sold its stock interest in CMS Generation
    San Nicolas Company.

In 2008, CMS Energy executed an agreement with MEI and a third
    party to assign the arbitration award and to sell its interests
    in TGN directly to the third party. In accordance with the
    agreements executed in 2007, the proceeds from the assignment of
    the arbitration award and the sale of TGN were passed on to MEI,
    and in 2008, CMS Energy recognized an $8 million gain on
    the assignment of the award in Gain on asset sales, net on CMS
    Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income. CMS Energy also
    recognized a $197 million cumulative net foreign currency
    translation loss related to TGN, which had been deferred as a
    Foreign currency translation component of stockholders’
    equity. This charge was fully offset by the elimination of a
    $197 million Argentine currency impairment reserve on CMS
    Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, created when it
    impaired its investment in TGN in 2007.

In 2010, CMS Enterprises exercised its option to sell its stock
    interest in CMS Generation San Nicolas Company and
    transferred the sale proceeds to MEI. As a result, CMS
    Enterprises recognized a $3 million net gain. In 2010, CMS
    Enterprises also sold a cost-method investment with a carrying
    value of zero, and recognized a $3 million gain.

    ($2 million net of tax) related to the State Street Bank
    and TSU litigation at CMS Viron. For additional details on CMS
    Viron, see Note 5, Contingencies and Commitments.

Also includes a gain for the expiration of an indemnity
    obligation related to a 2007 asset sale. CMS Energy provided an
    indemnity to TAQA in connection with the sale of its ownership
    interests in businesses in the Middle East, Africa, and India,
    and recorded a $50 million provision for the contingent
    liability. This indemnity expired in 2009 and CMS Energy
    eliminated the liability from its Consolidated Balance Sheets,
    recognizing a $45 million benefit ($28 million net of
    tax) to Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations and a
    $5 million benefit to Gain on asset sales, net.

Discontinued operations include a provision for closing costs
    and a portion of CMS Energy’s parent company interest
    expense. CMS Energy allocated interest expense of less than
    $1 million in each of 2010 and 2009 and $1 million in
    2008. CMS Energy allocates its interest expense by applying its
    total interest expense to the net carrying amount of the asset
    sold divided by CMS Energy’s total capitalization.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, CMS Energy’s management
    committed to a plan to sell its interest in Exeter and initiated
    an active program to locate potential buyers. CMS Energy
    completed the sale of this business in

Impairment
    Charges

In 2010, CMS Energy wrote down its investment in Exeter from its
    carrying amount of $11 million to Exeter’s fair value
    of $5 million. This valuation was based on the price that
    CMS Energy received for the sale of Exeter, which closed in
    January 2011. The impairment resulted in a loss of
    $6 million, which was recorded in earnings as part of
    discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,
    2010.

In May 2010, Consumers announced plans to defer the development
    of its proposed 830 MW coal-fueled plant at its
    Karn/Weadock generating complex. At that time, Consumers
    recorded a charge of $3 million to write off certain
    capitalized development costs because the costs were deemed not
    to have long-term value in connection with the potential future
    construction of the plant. The project’s air permit, issued
    by the MDNRE in December 2009, will expire in August 2011 if
    construction of the coal plant has not commenced or if Consumers
    has not been granted an extension of the air permit. In December
    2010, Consumers determined that it would not begin construction
    before August 2011 as a means of preserving the air permit. As a
    result, the likelihood that the plant will be constructed has
    diminished significantly. In December 2010, in accordance with
    accounting standards governing impairment of plant costs for
    regulated utilities, Consumers recorded an additional charge of
    $19 million to write off the remaining previously
    capitalized development costs associated with the proposed
    plant. The total charge of $22 million was recorded in
    other operating expenses for the year ended December 31,
    2010.

CMS Energy and Consumers recorded no other impairments of
    long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009, and 2008.

    business activities, such as revenue, labor dollars, customers,
    other operation and maintenance expense, construction expense,
    leased property, taxes, or functional surveys. For example,
    customer receivables are allocated based on revenue, and pension
    provisions are allocated based on labor dollars.

Inter-segment sales and transfers are accounted for at current
    market prices and are eliminated in consolidated Net Income
    Available to Common Stockholders by segment.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

CMS Energy Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of income, of cash flows,
    and of changes in equity present fairly, in all material
    respects, the financial position of CMS Energy Corporation and
    its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and December 31,
    2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) present fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report
    on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of

Consumers Energy Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of income, of cash flows,
    and of changes in equity present fairly, in all material
    respects, the financial position of Consumers Energy Company and
    its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and December 31,
    2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria

ITEM 9A.
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

CMS Energy

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
    and Procedures:

Under the supervision and with the
    participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMS
    Energy conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and
    procedures (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, CMS
    Energy’s CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
    2010.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting:

CMS Energy’s management is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

CMS Energy’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    GAAP and includes policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of CMS Energy;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of CMS
    Energy are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of CMS Energy; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
    CMS Energy’s assets that could have a material effect on
    its financial statements.

Management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its
    internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all
    fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
    design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
    resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
    considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation
    of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those
    internal controls may become inadequate in future periods
    because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including its CEO and CFO, CMS Energy conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this
    evaluation, management used the criteria set forth in the
    framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, CMS Energy’s
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010. The
    effectiveness of CMS Energy’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
    under Item 8.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting:

There have been no changes in CMS
    Energy’s internal control over financial reporting during
    the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its
    internal control over financial reporting.



Consumers

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
    and Procedures:

Under the supervision and with the
    participation of management, including its CEO and CFO,
    Consumers conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and
    procedures (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation,
    Consumers’ CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
    2010.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting:

Consumers’ management is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Consumers’ internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    GAAP and includes policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of Consumers;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of
    Consumers are being made only in accordance with authorizations
    of management and directors of Consumers; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
    Consumers’ assets that could have a material effect on its
    financial statements.

Management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its
    internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all
    fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
    design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
    resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
    considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation
    of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those
    internal controls may become inadequate in future periods
    because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including its CEO and CFO, Consumers conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this
    evaluation, management used the criteria set forth in the
    framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, Consumers’
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010. The
    effectiveness of Consumers’ internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under
    Item 8.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting:

There have been no changes in
    Consumers’ internal control over financial reporting during
    the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its
    internal control over financial reporting.
