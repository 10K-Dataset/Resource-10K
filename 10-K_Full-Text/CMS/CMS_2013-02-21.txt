PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

CMS E

NERGY

CMS Energy was formed as a corporation in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several
subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers serves individuals and businesses operating in the
alternative energy, automotive, chemical, metal, and food products industries, as well as a diversified group of other industries. CMS Enterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is
engaged primarily in independent power production and owns power generation facilities fueled mostly by natural gas and biomass.

CMS
Energy manages its businesses by the nature of services each provides and operates, principally in three business segments: electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises, its
non-utility operations and investments. Consumers' consolidated operations account for substantially all of CMS Energy's total assets, income, and operating revenue. CMS Energy's
consolidated operating revenue was $6.3 billion in 2012, $6.5 billion in 2011, and $6.4 billion in 2010.

For
further information about operating revenue, net operating income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to all of CMS Energy's business segments and operations, see Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, CMS Energy's Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ONSUMERS

Consumers has served Michigan customers since 1886. Consumers was incorporated in Maine in 1910 and became a Michigan corporation in 1968. Consumers owns and
operates electric distribution and generation facilities and gas transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. It provides electricity and/or natural gas to 6.6 million of Michigan's
10 million residents. Consumers' rates and certain other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC and FERC, as described in "CMS Energy and Consumers Regulation" in
this Item 1.

Consumers'
consolidated operating revenue was $6.0 billion in 2012, $6.3 billion in 2011, and $6.2 billion in 2010. For further information about operating revenue, net operating
income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to Consumers' electric and gas utility operations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Consumers' Selected
Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consumers
owns its principal properties in fee, except that most electric lines and gas mains are located below public roads or on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through easements
and other rights. Almost all of Consumers' properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond Indenture. For additional information on Consumers' properties, see Consumers Electric
Utility – Electric Utility Properties and Consumers Gas Utility – Gas Utility Properties in the "Business Segments" section of this Item 1.



In
2012, Consumers served 1.8 million electric customers and 1.7 million gas customers in Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following map is Consumers' service territory:

TILITY

Electric Utility Operations:

Consumers' electric utility operations, which include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated
operating revenue of $4.0 billion in 2012, $3.9 billion in 2011, and $3.8 billion in 2010. Consumers' electric utility customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial,
and diversified industrial customers in Michigan's Lower Peninsula.

Presented
in the following illustration is Consumers' 2012 electric utility operating revenue of $4.0 billion by customer class:

Consumers'
electric utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers' largest customers is not reasonably likely
to have a material adverse effect on Consumers' financial condition.

In
each of 2012 and 2011, Consumers' electric deliveries were 38 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of four billion kWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 34 billion kWh.

Consumers'
electric utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling
equipment.



Presented
in the following illustration are Consumers' monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including ROA
deliveries, during 2012 and 2011:

Consumers'
2012 summer peak demand was 9,006 MW, which included ROA demand of 619 MW. For the 2011-2012 winter period, Consumers' peak demand was 5,864 MW, which
included ROA demand of 500 MW. As required by MISO reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through long-term contracts, capacity required to supply most of its
projected firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2013. Consumers expects to acquire the balance of its 2013 requirements through MISO's forward capacity auction scheduled to be
conducted in April 2013.

Electric Utility Properties:

Consumers' distribution system includes:

•

421 miles of high-voltage distribution radial lines operating at 120 kilovolts or above;

•

4,259 miles of high-voltage distribution
overhead lines operating at 23 kilovolts, 46 kilovolts, and 69
kilovolts;

•

17 miles of high-voltage distribution underground lines operating at 23 kilovolts and 46 kilovolts;

•

55,965
miles of electric distribution overhead lines;

•

10,162 miles of underground distribution lines; and

•

substations with an
aggregate transformer capacity of 24 million kVA.



Consumers
is interconnected to the interstate high-voltage electric transmission system owned by Michigan Electric Transmission Company, LLC, a non-affiliated company,
and operated by MISO, to neighboring utilities, and to other transmission systems.

At
December 31, 2012, Consumers' electric generating system consisted of the following:

In 2012, Consumers' four coal-fueled generating sites burned 8 million tons of coal and produced a combined total of 14,027 GWh of
electricity, which represented 39 percent of the energy provided by Consumers to meet customer demand.

In
order to obtain its coal requirements, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts. At December 31, 2012, Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2015; payment obligations
under these contracts totaled $214 million. All of Consumers' coal supply contracts have fixed prices. At December 31, 2012, Consumers had 78 percent of its 2013 expected coal
requirements under contract, as well as a 45-day supply of coal on hand.



In
conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of rail cars and has long-term transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail and vessel services
for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers' generating facilities. Consumers' coal transportation contracts expire from 2013 through 2014; payment obligations under these contracts totaled
$238 million.

During
2012, Consumers purchased 52 percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs, seasonal purchases, and the Midwest Energy Market. Consumers offers
its generation into the Midwest Energy Market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers. Consumers is a net
purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the Midwest Energy Market to meet its customers' needs during peak demand periods.

At
December 31, 2012, Consumers had unrecognized future commitments (amounts for which liabilities, in accordance with GAAP, have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase capacity
and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants' availability or deliverability. The payments for 2013
through 2040 total $12.5 billion and range from $911 million to $964 million annually for each of the next five years. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and
fuel costs. For further information about Consumers' future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A — Capital
Resources and Liquidity and Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments — Contractual Commitments.

Electric Utility Competition:

Consumers' electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and
retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services.

The
Customer Choice Act allows all of Consumers' electric customers to buy electric generation service from Consumers or from an alternative electric supplier. The 2008 Energy Law revised the Customer
Choice Act by limiting alternative electric supply to ten percent of weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At December 31, 2012, electric deliveries under the ROA
program were at the ten percent limit. Alternative electric suppliers were providing 777 MW of generation service to ROA customers.

Consumers
also has competition or potential competition from:

•

industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside Consumers' service territory for
economic reasons;

•

municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and

•

customer self-generation.

Consumers
addresses this competition by monitoring activity in adjacent areas and monitoring compliance with the MPSC's and FERC's rules, providing non-energy services,
providing value to customers through Consumers' rates and service, and offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development.

Gas Utility Operations:

Consumers' gas utility operations, which include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated
operating revenue of



$2.0 billion
in 2012, $2.3 billion in 2011, and $2.4 billion in 2010. Consumers' gas utility customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial
customers in Michigan's Lower Peninsula.

Presented
in the following illustration is Consumers' 2012 gas utility operating revenue of $2.0 billion by customer class:

Consumers'
gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers' largest customers is not reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on Consumers' financial condition.

In
2012, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers' pipeline and distribution network, totaled 329 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of
49 bcf. In 2011, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers' pipeline and distribution network, totaled 337 bcf, which
included GCC deliveries of 48 bcf. Consumers' gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use during the winter months when the
demand for natural gas is higher. Peak demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel. During 2012, 42 percent of the natural gas
supplied to all customers during the winter months was supplied from storage.



Presented
in the following illustration are Consumers' monthly weather-adjusted gas deliveries to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during 2012 and 2011:

Gas Utility Properties:

Consumers' gas distribution and transmission system located in Michigan's Lower Peninsula consists
of:

•

26,720 miles of distribution mains;

•

1,657 miles of transmission lines;

•

seven compressor stations with a total of 151,172 installed and available horsepower; and

•

15 gas storage fields with an aggregate storage capacity of 309 bcf and a working storage
capacity of 143 bcf.



Gas Utility Supply:

In 2012, Consumers purchased 62 percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers and 9 percent from Canadian producers. The
remaining 29 percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program. Presented in the following illustration are the supply arrangements
for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2012:

Firm
transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame. Consumers' firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR Pipeline
Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, L.P., Panhandle, and Trunkline. Under these contracts, Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers.
Consumers' firm gas transportation contracts expire through 2017 and provide for the delivery of 75 percent of Consumers' total gas supply requirements. Consumers purchases the balance of its
required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program.

Gas Utility Competition:

Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers' gas utility business. Competition comes from other gas suppliers taking advantage of
direct access to Consumers' customers (GCC) and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.

CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS REGULATION

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governmental
agencies, including those described in the following sections.



FERC

FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several independent power plants and exempt wholesale generators in which CMS
Enterprises has ownership interests, as well as over CMS ERM, CMS Gas Transmission, and DIG. Among other things, FERC has jurisdiction over acquisitions, operations, and disposals of certain assets
and facilities, services provided and rates charged, conduct among affiliates, and limited jurisdiction over holding company matters with respect to CMS Energy. FERC, in connection with NERC and with
regional reliability organizations, also regulates generation owners and operators, load
serving entities, purchase and sale entities, and others with regard to reliability of the bulk power system. FERC regulates limited aspects of Consumers' gas business, principally compliance with
FERC capacity release rules, shipping rules, the prohibition against certain buy/sell transactions, and the price-reporting rule.

FERC
also regulates certain aspects of Consumers' electric operations, including compliance with FERC accounting rules, wholesale rates, operation of licensed hydroelectric generating plants,
transfers of certain facilities, corporate mergers, and issuances of securities.

MPSC

Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail utility
rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities, corporate mergers, and other matters.

The
Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers. The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, and others often
appeal significant MPSC orders.

EGISLATION

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various legislative-driven matters, including Michigan's 2008 Energy Law. This law requires that at
least ten percent of Consumers' electric sales volume come from renewable energy sources by 2015, and includes requirements for specific capacity additions. The 2008 Energy Law also requires Consumers
to prepare an energy optimization plan and achieve annual sales reduction targets through at least 2015. The targets are incremental with the goal of achieving a six percent reduction in customers'



electricity
use and a four percent reduction in customers' natural gas use by December 31, 2015. The 2008 Energy Law also reformed the Customer Choice Act to limit alternative energy suppliers
to supplying no more than ten percent of Consumers' weather-adjusted sales. For additional information regarding Consumers' renewable energy and energy optimization plans and the Customer Choice Act,
see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A, Outlook, "Consumers Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties."

CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations for environmental quality,
including air and water quality, solid waste management, and other matters. For additional information concerning environmental matters, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments.

CMS
Energy has recorded a significant liability for its affiliates' obligations associated with Bay Harbor and Consumers has recorded a significant liability for its obligations at a number of MGP
sites. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4,
Contingencies and Commitments.

Air:

Consumers continues to install state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants and to
convert electric generating units to burn cleaner fuels. Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of $835 million from 2013 through 2018 to comply with present and future federal and
state regulations that will require extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, and mercury emissions. Consumers' estimate may increase if additional or more
stringent laws or regulations are adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide.

Solid Waste Disposal:

Costs related to the construction, operation, and closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant. Historically,
Consumers has worked with others to reuse 30 to 50 percent of ash produced by its coal-fueled plants, and sells ash for use as a Portland cement replacement in concrete products, as
feedstock for the manufacture of Portland cement, and for other environmentally sustainable uses. Consumers' solid waste disposal areas are regulated under Michigan's solid waste rules. Consumers has
converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems. All of Consumers' ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly MDEQ inspections. The EPA
has proposed new federal regulations for ash disposal areas. Consumers preliminarily estimates that it will incur expenditures of $125 million from 2013 through 2018 to comply with future
regulations relating to ash disposal, assuming ash is regulated as a non-hazardous solid waste.

Water:

Consumers uses significant amounts of water to operate and cool its electric generating plants. Water discharge quality is regulated and administered by the
MDEQ under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation, Consumers' facilities have discharge monitoring programs. The EPA is developing new regulations related to cooling water intake
systems, but these new regulations are not expected to take effect until after 2018. Accordingly, Consumers does not presently expect to incur any significant expenditures to comply with future
regulations relating to cooling water intake systems through 2018. Significant expenditures could be required beyond 2018, but until a rule is final, any potential expenditures are difficult to
predict. Consumers also expects the EPA to propose new federal regulations for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants in 2013, with a final rule in 2014. Consumers'



preliminary
estimate of expenditures to comply with these expected regulations is $180 million from 2013 through 2018.

For
further information concerning estimated capital expenditures related to air, solid waste disposal, and water see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A, Outlook,
"Consumers Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties – Electric Environmental Estimates."

INSURANCE

CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the
same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses. A portion of each
loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS Energy or Consumers renews its
policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets.

CMS
Energy's and Consumers' present insurance program does not cover the risks of certain environmental cleanup costs and environmental damages, such as claims for air pollution, damage to sites owned
by CMS Energy or Consumers, and some long-term storage or disposal of wastes.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Actual results in future periods for CMS Energy and Consumers could differ materially from historical results and the
forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors that might cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections.
CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, that involve uncertainties that may materially affect results, and that are often beyond
their control. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the companies' management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the companies. The risk factors described in
the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of
CMS Energy or
Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMS Energy. All of these risk factors are potentially significant.

CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations.

Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment
obligations. Consumers' ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers' preferred stock provisions and potentially by other
legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation, and by FERC requirements. At December 31, 2012, under its articles of incorporation, Consumers had
$536 million of unrestricted retained earnings available to pay common stock dividends. If sufficient dividends are not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy may not
be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's liquidity and financial condition.

CMS Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations.

At December 31, 2012, CMS Energy, including Consumers, had $7.2 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness.
CMS Energy had $2.4 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, there were no borrowings and $2 million of letters
of credit outstanding under CMS Energy's revolving credit agreement. CMS Energy and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future.

The
level of CMS Energy's present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among
others:

•

a significant portion of CMS Energy's cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and
interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes;

•

covenants contained in CMS Energy's existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain
financial tests,
could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business;

•

CMS Energy's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures,
 acquisitions, and
general corporate and other purposes could become limited;

•

CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged;



•

CMS Energy's vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase;
and

•

CMS Energy's future credit ratings could fluctuate.

CMS Energy's
ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions,
industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make
assurances that its business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness. If CMS Energy is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from
operations, it may be required to sell assets or obtain additional financing. CMS Energy cannot ensure that additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.

CMS Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. Potential disruption in the capital and
credit markets could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses, including the availability and cost of short-term funds for liquidity requirements and
their ability to meet long-term commitments. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of
operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands under commercial commitments, guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and
other contingent liabilities. Consumers' capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several
years as it implements renewable power generation and environmental projects, and those requirements may increase if additional laws or regulations are adopted or implemented.

CMS Energy
and Consumers rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term
liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from Consumers' operations and, in the case of CMS Energy, dividends from Consumers and its other subsidiaries. CMS Energy and
Consumers also use letters of credit issued under certain of their revolving credit facilities to support certain operations and investments.

Longer
term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could
adversely affect CMS Energy's and Consumers' access to liquidity needed for their respective businesses, as could Consumers' inability to obtain prior FERC authorization for any securities
issuances, including publicly offered debt, as is required under the Federal Power Act. Any disruption or inability to obtain FERC authorization could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take
measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for their business needs can be arranged. These measures could include deferring capital
expenditures, changing CMS Energy's and Consumers' commodity purchasing strategy to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend
payments, or other discretionary uses of cash.

CMS Energy
continues to explore financing opportunities to supplement its financial plan. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, preferred stock and/or
common equity, and bank financing. Similarly, Consumers plans to seek funds through the capital markets, commercial lenders, and leasing arrangements. Entering into new financings is subject in part
to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMS Energy's and Consumers' securities in particular. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot



guarantee
the capital markets' acceptance of their securities or predict the impact of factors beyond their control, such as actions of rating agencies. If CMS Energy or Consumers is unable to
obtain bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness, or is unable to obtain commercially reasonable terms for any financing, there could be a material adverse effect
on its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

Certain
of CMS Energy's securities and those of its affiliates, including Consumers, are rated by various credit rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit
ratings
could have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy's or Consumers' ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could make its cost of borrowing higher,
and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to reduce its capital expenditures. If it is unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers may have to post collateral or
make prepayments to certain of its suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a
lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy's credit ratings. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of their present ratings will remain in
effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.

There are risks associated with Consumers' significant capital investment program planned for the next five years.

Consumers' planned investments include the Smart Energy program, new power generation, gas compression, environmental controls, and other electric
and gas infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems. The success of these investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, effective cost and schedule
management during implementation, changes in commodity and other prices, operational performance, changes in environmental, legislative and regulatory requirements, and regulatory cost recovery.
Consumers cannot predict the impact that any of these factors could have on the success of its capital investment program. It is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a
material adverse effect on Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

Electric industry legislation in Michigan, coupled with increased competition in gas and electric markets, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and
Consumers' businesses.

The 2008 Energy Law, among other things, limits alternative electric supply to ten percent of weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding
calendar year. Lower natural gas prices due to a large supply of natural gas on the market, coupled with low capacity prices in the electric supply market, are placing increasing competitive pressure
on Consumers' electric supply. Presently, Consumers' electric rates are above the Midwest average, while the ROA level on Consumers' system is at the ten-percent cap and the proportion of
Consumers' electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is 25 percent. In February 2013, a proposal was made to raise the ROA limit above ten percent. If the bill is
enacted, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers' business. In addition, the Michigan legislature is conducting hearings on the subject of energy competition. If other bills to raise the
ROA limit above ten percent are proposed in the future and enacted, they could have a material adverse effect on Consumers' business.

Recently,
the Michigan governor announced a process pursuant to which a series of reports are to be completed in December 2013 addressing energy efficiency, renewable energy, the electricity market
and customer choice, and other subjects. The process is designed to help the



governor
and other lawmakers determine the state's next steps regarding energy policies. A series of public hearings have been scheduled in 2013 to gather input. Consumers expects to participate
actively in this process but cannot predict its outcome.

Other
new legislation or interpretations could change how the businesses of CMS Energy and Consumers operate, impact Consumers' ability to recover costs through rate increases, or require
CMS Energy and Consumers to incur additional expenses.

CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have an adverse effect on financial results.

CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Electric and gas rates for their utilities are set by the MPSC and cannot be
increased without regulatory authorization. While Consumers is permitted by the 2008 Energy Law to self-implement rate changes six months after a rate filing with the MPSC, subject to
certain limitations, if a final rate order from the MPSC provides for lower rates than Consumers self-implemented, Consumers must refund the difference, with interest. Also, the MPSC may
delay or deny implementation of a rate increase upon showing of good cause. In February 2011, the MPSC found good cause to delay Consumers' self-implementation of its requested gas rate
increase. Consumers did not experience delays in self-implementation of rate increases in 2012.

In
addition, Consumers' plans for making significant capital investments, including modifications to meet new environmental requirements and investment in new generation, could be affected adversely
or could have a material adverse effect on Consumers if rate regulators fail to provide timely rate relief or to approve a Certificate of Necessity for new generation. Regulators seeking to avoid or
minimize rate increases could resist raising customer rates sufficiently to permit Consumers to recover the full cost of modifications to meet environmental requirements and other prudent investments.
In addition, because certain costs are mandated by state requirements for cost recovery, such as resource additions to meet Michigan's renewable resource standard, regulators could be more inclined to
oppose rate increases for other required
items and investments. Rate regulators could also face pressure to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including failure of Michigan's economy to improve sufficiently or
diminishment of Consumers' customer base. In addition to potentially affecting Consumers' investment program, any limitation of cost recovery through rates could have a material adverse effect on
Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

Orders
of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service including, but not limited to, environmental and safety related expenditures for coal-fueled plants and other utility
properties, power supply and natural gas supply costs, operating and maintenance expenses, additional utility-based investments, sunk investment in mothballed or retired coal-fueled generating plants,
costs associated with the proposed retirement and decommissioning of facilities, depreciation expense, MISO energy and transmission costs, costs associated with energy efficiency investments and state
or federally mandated renewable resource standards, Smart Energy program costs, or expenditures subjected to tracking mechanisms. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of
other matters including, but not limited to, prevention or curtailment of shutoffs for non-paying customers, Consumers' gas revenue decoupling mechanism, prevention or curtailment of
rights to self-implement rate requests, or refunds of previously self-implemented rates.

FERC
authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell electricity at market-based rates. Failure of CMS Energy and Consumers to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a



timely
manner could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

The
various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory
proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any such agency decisions, could have a substantial negative effect on the companies' investment plans and results of
operations.

Electric industry regulation could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses.

Federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed dramatically in the last two decades and could continue to change over the next
several years. These changes could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS Energy
and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive federal and state utility regulation. In CMS Energy's and Consumers' business planning and management of operations,
they must address the effects of existing and proposed regulation on their businesses and changes in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by federal and state legislatures, regional
transmission organizations, utility regulators, and taxing authorities. Adoption of new regulations by federal or state agencies, or changes to present regulations and interpretations of these
regulations, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

There
are multiple proceedings pending before FERC involving transmission matters. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of these electric industry restructuring proceedings on
their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

Periodic reviews of the values of CMS Energy's and Consumers' assets could result in impairment charges.

CMS Energy and Consumers are required by GAAP to review periodically the carrying value of their assets, including those that may be sold.
Market conditions, the operational characteristics of their assets, and other factors could result in recording impairment charges for their assets, which could have an adverse effect on their
stockholders equity and their access to additional financing. In addition, CMS Energy and Consumers may be required to record impairment charges at the time they sell assets, depending on the
sale prices they are able to secure and other factors.

CMS Energy and Consumers could incur significant costs to comply with environmental requirements.

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to costly and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. They believe that
environmental laws and
regulations related to their operations will continue to become more stringent and require them to make additional significant capital expenditures for emissions control equipment.

In
2011, the EPA finalized and promulgated CSAPR as a replacement for CAIR. In August 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit voided CSAPR and held that CAIR would



remain
in place until the EPA promulgated a new rule. A request by the EPA for a rehearing of this ruling was denied.

In
December 2011, the EPA issued the maximum achievable control technology standard for electric generating units, also known as MATS. This rule is expected to have a significant impact on Consumers'
coal-fueled generating fleet.

In
addition, the EPA is continually in the process of tightening standards for air quality. The EPA recently proposed new rules relating to fine particulate matter and ozone. These changes could also
have a significant impact on Consumers' coal-fueled generating fleet.

In
May 2010, the EPA issued a final rule that addresses greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act permitting programs. The "tailoring rule" sets thresholds for
greenhouse gas emissions that define when permits under the NSR and Title V programs are required for new and existing industrial facilities. This regulation took effect in January 2011. In March
2012, the EPA released its proposed "Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units." The proposed rule applies only to new
fossil-fuel-fired steam electric generating units and would require that carbon dioxide emissions not exceed those of a modern, efficient natural gas combined-cycle-plant,
regardless of fuel type. The EPA is also expected to propose emissions guidelines within the next one to three years for states to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing generating stations.
In addition, legislation to regulate, control, or limit greenhouse gases could be enacted in the future by the U.S. Congress.

In
2012, 98 percent of the energy generated by Consumers came from fossil-fueled power plants, with 80 percent coming from coal-fueled power plants. CMS Enterprises
also has interests in fossil-fueled power plants and other types of power plants that produce greenhouse gases. The aforementioned federal laws and rules, as well as additional laws and rules, if
enacted, and international accords and treaties, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail
operations, invest in non-fossil-fuel generating capacity, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases.

The
following risks related to climate change and emissions could also have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of
operations:

•

litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy, Consumers, or their subsidiaries due to
CMS Energy's or Consumers' greenhouse gas or other emissions;

•

impairment of CMS Energy's or Consumers' reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public
perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation; and

•

extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms, that may affect customer demand,
company operations, or assets.

The
EPA is considering regulating CCRs, such as coal ash, as hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Michigan already regulates CCRs as low-hazard industrial
waste. If coal ash is regulated as a hazardous waste, Consumers would likely cease the beneficial re-use of this product, resulting in significantly more coal ash requiring costly
disposal. Additionally, it is possible that existing landfills could be closed if the upgrades to hazardous waste landfill standards are economically prohibitive. Costs associated with this potential
regulation could be substantial.



The
EPA is revising regulations that govern cooling water intake structures aimed at protecting aquatic life and that govern water discharges. Costs associated with these revisions could be material
to CMS Energy, Consumers, and CMS Enterprises and result in operational changes or possibly significant impacts on the economics of generating units. In addition, the EPA is expected to
propose new regulations in 2013 for wastewater discharges from electric generating
plants. These new regulations may require physical and/or chemical treatment facilities for all waste water.

CMS Energy
and Consumers expect to collect fully from their customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this
outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, it could negatively affect CMS Energy's and/or Consumers' liquidity, results of operations, and
financial condition and CMS Energy and/or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures.

For
additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item 1. Business, CMS Energy and Consumers Environmental Compliance and Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A, Outlook, "Consumers Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties."

CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements.

A delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits, approvals under the MISO tariff, or
approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission control equipment could:

•

prevent the construction of new facilities;

•

prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing facilities;

•

prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities;

•

prevent the modification of existing facilities; or

•

result in significant additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition,
and results of operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers expect to incur additional significant costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites.

Consumers is presently monitoring or remediating 23 former MGP sites. Consumers is working collaboratively with the MDEQ to agree upon executable
remediation plans. About one-third of the 23 sites have been remediated to the extent possible and are now being monitored. The remaining sites are being actively remediated through
excavation, treatment at the site, containment, and/or natural reduction; two of these sites require complex remediation plans due to the involvement of surface water.

The
MDEQ established a "No Further Action" status for these sites and others like them in late 2010 and is presently overhauling the implementation of the 2010 statutory revisions with a focus on
streamlining the process, reasonable and consistent implementation, and risk-based techniques.

CMS Energy
and Consumers expect to incur additional significant costs related to the remediation of these former MGP sites. Based upon prior MPSC orders, Consumers expects to



be
able to recover the costs of these cleanup activities through its gas rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome.

In
addition, CMS Energy retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection and treatment of leachate at Bay Harbor after selling its interests in the development in 2002.
Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. CMS Energy has signed agreements with the EPA and the MDEQ relating
to Bay Harbor. If CMS Energy were unable to meet its commitments under these agreements, or if unanticipated events occurred, CMS Energy could incur additional material costs relating to
its Bay Harbor remediation obligations.

Consumers
also expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of other sites under NREPA and Superfund. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but
cannot guarantee that outcome.

CMS Energy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities.

In 2002, CMS Energy notified appropriate regulatory and governmental agencies that some employees at CMS MST and CMS Field
Services appeared to have provided inaccurate information regarding natural gas trades to various energy industry publications which compile and report index prices. CMS Energy has cooperated
with the DOJ's investigation regarding this matter. CMS Energy is unable to predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation or the amount of any fines or penalties that may be imposed and what
effect, if any, the investigation will have on CMS Energy.

CMS Energy,
CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas, Inc., and Cantera Gas Company were named as defendants in various lawsuits arising as a result of alleged
false natural gas price reporting. Allegations included manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices
in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. CMS Energy cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits or the amount of damages for which CMS Energy may be liable. It is possible that the
outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

The
agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to:

•

retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions;

•

indemnify the buyers against
specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that
CMS Energy and Consumers make; and

•

make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other
reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions.

Many
of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers may ultimately seek to enforce their rights
under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's or Consumers' liquidity, financial condition,
and results of operations.



In
January 2002, CMS Energy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMS Energy owes $142 million in
taxes, plus interest, in connection with the sale. CMS Energy has concluded that the government's tax claim is without merit. The government of Equatorial Guinea indicated through a request for
arbitration in October 2011 that it still intends to pursue its claim. CMS Energy is vigorously contesting the claim, and cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter. It is
possible that the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS Energy's and Consumers' energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year.

CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses are seasonal. Demand for electricity is greater in the summer cooling season and the winter heating
season. Demand for natural gas peaks in the winter heating season. Accordingly, their overall results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer
cooling season and winter heating season could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories.

Consumers' electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. Although Consumers
believes that economic conditions in Michigan are improving, the economy in Consumers' service territories
continues to be affected adversely by the recession and its impact on the state's automotive and real estate sectors and by relatively high unemployment. In addition, Consumers' largest single
customer has experienced sharply reduced electric demand. The Michigan economy also has been affected negatively by the uncertainty in the financial and credit markets. If economic conditions in
Michigan decline further, Consumers may experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers'
service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas, which in turn impact its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures.

In the regular course of business, CMS Energy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. CMS Energy and Consumers
are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of CMS Energy's and Consumers' information
systems could involve theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, such as confidential customer information or, separately, system operating information. These events could
disrupt operations, subject CMS Energy and Consumers to possible financial liability, damage their reputation and diminish the confidence of customers, and have a material adverse effect on CMS
Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial conditions, and results of operations.

CMS
Energy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation
of security measures, CMS Energy's and Consumers' technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures, cyber crime, and unauthorized access. Those failures or breaches could impact the
reliability of electric and gas generation and delivery and also subject



CMS
Energy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMS
Energy and Consumers, has increased in frequency, scope, and potential impact in recent years. While CMS Energy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber crime incidents that have had a material
impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber attack in the future. If CMS Energy's and Consumers' technology systems were to fail
or be breached, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data
could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

A
variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of
these technologies, or the inability of CMS Energy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations
and materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses have safety risks.

Consumers' electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure, and energy products could be involved in accidents that result in
injury or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles and
self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident or accident, CMS Energy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, damage to its
reputation, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.

CMS Energy's and Consumers' revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, terrorist
attacks or related acts of war, hostile cyber intrusions, or other catastrophic events.

The impact of natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts, cyber intrusions, and other catastrophic events on the facilities and operations of CMS Energy
and Consumers could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. A terrorist attack on physical infrastructure or a major natural disaster could
result in severe damage to CMS Energy's and Consumers' assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies. Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information systems as well
as electronic control systems used at the generating plants and for the electric and gas distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, as
well as significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage. Terrorist attacks or acts of war could result in the disruption of power and fuel markets that could increase costs or disrupt
service. Widespread outages in Consumers' systems as a result of storms, floods, or other natural disasters could result in a prolonged loss of service to customers and significant expense to repair
system damages. There is a risk that the regulators could assess Consumers' preparedness or response as inadequate and take adverse actions as a result.

Instability
in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, credit crises, recessions, or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers'
liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.



CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks.

Consumers is actively engaged in multiple regulatory oversight processes and has a large electric and gas customer base. As a result, Consumers has a
highly visible public profile in Michigan. Consumers and CMS Energy could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate compliance
policies, regulatory violations, or other events. This could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. It could also
result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight.

The markets for alternative energy and distributed generation could impact financial results.

Advances in technology could reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity, such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills, and
photovoltaic (solar) cells, to a level that is competitive with that of fossil-fuel technology utilized by CMS Energy and Consumers to produce a majority of their electricity. It is also
possible that electric customers could reduce their electric consumption significantly through demand-side energy conservation programs. Changes in technology could also alter the channels
through which electric customers buy electricity. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.

Energy risk management strategies may not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMS Energy and
Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings.

Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, electricity, emission allowances, and RECs. Prices for natural gas, coal,
electricity, emission allowances, and RECs may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose Consumers to commodity price risk. A substantial portion of Consumers' operating
expenses for its plants consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. Consumers manages these risks using established policies and procedures, and it may use various contracts to manage these
risks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing Consumers' pricing risk or that they will not result in
net liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in these markets.

Natural
gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in
commodity prices associated with its gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred
costs associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers does
not always hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As
a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in greater unhedged positions than preferred at a
given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of
operations.



CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of those with whom they do business.

CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom they do business. Adverse economic conditions or financial
difficulties experienced by these counterparties could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for CMS Energy's and Consumers' services or fulfill their contractual obligations, including
performance and payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform services timely. Any delay or default in payment or performance of contractual
obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

In
recent years, the capital and credit markets have experienced unprecedented high levels of volatility and disruption. Market volatility and disruption could have a negative impact on CMS Energy's
and Consumers' lenders, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a negative impact on the loan
portfolio of CMS Energy's banking subsidiary, EnerBank.

Consumers may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal or natural gas, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its
natural gas customers.

Consumers is dependent on coal for a significant portion of its electric generating capacity. While Consumers has coal supply and transportation
contracts in place, there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal to Consumers. The suppliers under the agreements may experience
financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to Consumers
under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If Consumers were unable to obtain its coal requirements under existing or future coal supply and transportation contracts, it
might be required to purchase coal at higher prices or forced to purchase electricity from higher cost generating resources in the Midwest Energy Market, which would increase Consumers' working
capital requirements.

Consumers
has firm interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate deliveries of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to
Consumers in the event of a counterparty's failure to perform, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these firm interstate transportation and supply agreements will fulfill their
obligations to provide natural gas to Consumers. In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be required to deliver natural gas to Consumers in certain circumstances, such as in the event of
a natural disaster. If Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas supply requirements under existing or future natural gas supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to purchase
natural gas at higher prices from other sources or implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC, which would increase Consumers' working capital requirements and decrease its
natural gas revenues.

Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require significant funding.

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMS Energy's and
Consumers' pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to
market fluctuations and will



yield
uncertain returns, which may fall below CMS Energy's and Consumers' forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to
measure the required minimum funding levels may significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or
changes in life expectancy assumptions, may significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, while CMS Energy
and Consumers presently do not expect that the Health Care Acts will significantly increase obligations of their postretirement benefit plans, they cannot guarantee this outcome. If CMS Energy and
Consumers are unable to manage their pension and postretirement plan assets successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers.

Over 40 percent of Consumers' employees are represented by unions. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other
slowdown, or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. Additionally,
while Consumers presently has good relationships with the unions representing its employees, Consumers cannot predict the impact of recent Right to Work legislation on union negotiations and
relationships when existing union contracts expire.

Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm CMS Energy's and Consumers' results of operations.

The workforce of CMS Energy and Consumers is aging and a number of employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years. If CMS Energy
and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and
delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement
employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could affect CMS Energy's and Consumers' ability to manage and operate their businesses. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable
to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations could be affected negatively.

Unplanned power plant outages could be costly for Consumers.

Unforeseen maintenance of our power plants may be required for many reasons, including catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods, or
other acts of God, equipment failure, operator error, or to comply with environmental or safety regulations. When unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or other equipment, Consumers
will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but it may also have to make spot market purchases of replacement electricity that exceed Consumers' costs of generation. Additionally, unplanned
maintenance work may reduce the capacity credit Consumers receives from MISO and may cause Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years. If Consumers were unable to recover any of
these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.



Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMS Energy's and Consumers' results
of operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of
operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to
these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing
authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves at CMS Energy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results
of operations.

CMS
Energy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws. Increases in local, state, or federal tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts on their liquidity, financial
condition, and results of operations.

CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers and EnerBank, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations, which are subject to change and may
involve material costs or affect operations.

In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was passed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is a sweeping piece of legislation, and the financial
services industry is still assessing the impacts. Congress detailed some significant changes, but the Dodd-Frank Act leaves many details to be determined by regulation and further study.
Regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are being adopted by the appropriate agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Bureau of Consumer Financial
Protection, which is part of the Federal Reserve and has been granted significant rule-making authority in the area of consumer financial products and services. The direction that the
Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection will take, the regulations it will adopt, and its interpretation of existing laws and regulations are not yet fully known.

The
Dodd-Frank Act added a new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act. Known as the Volcker Rule, it generally restricts certain banking entities (such as EnerBank) and their
subsidiaries or affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading activities and from owning equity in or sponsoring any private equity or hedge fund. The statutory effective date of the Volcker Rule
was July 2012, but it is subject to certain transition periods and exceptions for "permitted activities." In April 2012, the Federal Reserve Board issued a statement clarifying that banks and other
financial institutions have until July 2014 to conform fully their activities and investments to the requirements, but final implementing regulations have not yet been issued. Under the statute and
based on draft regulations issued in October 2011, the activities of CMS Energy and its subsidiaries (including EnerBank) are not expected to be materially affected; however, they would be restricted
from engaging in proprietary trading, investing in third-party hedge or private equity funds, and sponsoring these funds in the future unless CMS Energy qualified for an exemption from the rule. CMS
Energy cannot predict the full impact of the Volcker Rule on CMS Energy's or EnerBank's operations or financial condition until final regulations are issued.

Furthermore,
effective July 2011, all companies that directly or indirectly control an FDIC-insured bank are required to serve as a source of financial strength for that institution. As a
result, CMS Energy could be called upon by the FDIC to infuse additional capital into EnerBank to the extent that EnerBank fails to satisfy its capital requirements. In addition, CMS



Energy
is contractually required (i) to make cash capital contributions to EnerBank in the event that EnerBank does not maintain required minimum capital ratios and (ii) to provide
EnerBank financial support, in an amount and duration as may be necessary for EnerBank to meet the cash needs of its depositors and other operations. EnerBank has exceeded these requirements
historically and exceeds them as of February 2013.

In
addition, the Dodd-Frank Act potentially provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain energy-related contracts. CMS Energy expects that it and its subsidiaries
will qualify for an end-user exception, but these regulations could affect the ability of CMS Energy and its subsidiaries to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight
over their contracting activities. Although CMS Energy and Consumers do not expect that this will have material impacts on their energy contracting activities, they cannot predict the outcome.

CMS Energy could be required to pay cash to certain security holders in connection with the optional conversion of their convertible securities.

CMS Energy has outstanding one series of cash-convertible securities, of which an aggregate principal amount of $172 million was
outstanding at December 31, 2012. If the trading price of CMS Energy's common stock exceeds a specified amount at the end of a particular fiscal quarter, then holders of these convertible
securities will have the option to convert their securities in the following fiscal quarter, with the principal amount payable in cash by CMS Energy. Accordingly, if the trading price minimum is
satisfied and security holders exercise their conversion rights, CMS Energy may be required to outlay a significant amount of cash to those security holders and recognize losses, which could have a
material adverse effect on CMS Energy's liquidity and results of operations.

CMS Energy's and Consumers' financial statements, including their reported earnings, could be significantly impacted by convergence with International Financial Reporting
Standards.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board is expected to make broad changes to GAAP as part of an overall initiative to converge U.S. standards with
International Financial Reporting Standards. These changes could have significant impacts on the financial statements of CMS Energy and Consumers. Also, the SEC is considering incorporating
International Financial Reporting Standards into the financial reporting system for U.S. registrants. A transition to International Financial Reporting Standards could significantly impact CMS
Energy's and Consumers' financial results, since these standards differ from GAAP in many ways. One of the major differences is the lack of special accounting treatment for regulated activities under
International Financial Reporting Standards, which could result in greater earnings volatility for CMS Energy and Consumers.

CMS Energy Corporation

Consumers Energy Company

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This MD&A is a combined report of CMS Energy and Consumers.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

CMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including
Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers' electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, distribution, and
sale of electricity, and Consumers' gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers' customer base consists of a mix of
residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. CMS Enterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, owns and operates power generation facilities.

CMS
Energy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMS Energy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and enterprises,
its non-utility investments and operations. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility.

CMS
Energy and Consumers earn revenue and generate cash from operations by providing electric and natural gas utility services; electric distribution and generation; gas transmission, storage, and
distribution; and other energy-related services. Their businesses are affected primarily by:

•

regulation and regulatory matters;

•

economic conditions;

•

weather;

•

energy commodity prices;

•

interest rates; and

•

CMS Energy's
and Consumers' securities' credit ratings.

CMS
Energy's business strategy emphasizes the key elements depicted below:



S

AFE,

E

XCELLENT

O

PERATIONS

The safety of employees, customers, and the general public remains a priority of CMS Energy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMS Energy and Consumers have worked to
integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs
and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. From 2006 to 2012, Consumers achieved a 76 percent reduction in the annual number of recordable safety incidents.

C

USTOMER

V

ALUE

Consumers is undertaking a number of initiatives that reflect its intensified customer focus. Consumers' planned investments in reliability are aimed at
improving safety, reducing customer outage frequency, reducing repetitive outages, and increasing customer satisfaction. Also, in
order to minimize increases in customer rates, Consumers has undertaken several initiatives to reduce costs through a voluntary separation plan, accelerated pension funding, health-care
cost sharing, negotiated labor agreements, information system efficiencies, and productivity improvement programs. Consumers considers these and other aspects of its customer value initiative to be
important to its success.

U

TILITY

I

NVESTMENT

Consumers expects to make capital investments of about $7 billion from 2013 through 2017, as presented in the following illustration:

Consumers
has limited its capital investment program to those investments it believes are needed to provide safe, reliable, and efficient service to its customers. Consumers' capital investment
program is expected to result in annual rate base growth of five to seven percent while allowing Consumers to maintain sustainable customer base rate increases (excluding PSCR and GCR charges) at or
below the rate of inflation.



Among
the key components of Consumers' investment program are projects that will enhance customer value. Consumers' planned base capital investments of $3.2 billion comprise $2.1 billion
of electric utility projects to improve reliability and increase capacity and $1.1 billion of gas utility projects to increase capacity and deliverability and enhance pipeline integrity. An
additional $1.4 billion of planned reliability investments at Consumers are aimed at reducing outages and improving customer satisfaction; these investments comprise $0.7 billion at the
electric utility to strengthen circuits and substations, replace poles, and upgrade the Ludington pumped-storage
plant, and $0.7 billion at the gas utility to replace mains and enhance transmission and storage systems. Consumers also expects to spend $1.1 billion on environmental investments needed
to comply with state and federal laws and regulations.

In
December 2012, Consumers announced plans to build a 700-MW gas-fueled plant at its Thetford complex in Genesee County, Michigan and filed an air permit application with the
MDEQ for the proposed plant. Construction of the plant, at an estimated cost of $750 million, is contingent upon obtaining a Certificate of Necessity from the MPSC and environmental permits.
Consumers expects the plant to be operational in 2017.

Renewable
energy projects are another major component of Consumers' planned capital investments. Consumers expects to spend $0.3 billion on renewable energy investments, under an
MPSC-approved renewable energy plan, from 2013 through 2017. The 2008 Energy Law requires that at least ten percent of Consumers' electric sales volume come from renewable energy sources
by 2015, and it includes requirements for specific capacity additions. Consumers has historically included renewable resources as part of its portfolio, with about eight percent of its present power
supply coming from such renewable sources as hydroelectric, landfill gas, biomass, and wind.

Consumers'
Smart Energy program, with an estimated total project capital cost of $0.8 billion, also represents a major capital investment. The full-scale deployment of advanced
metering infrastructure began in August 2012 and is planned to continue through 2019. Consumers has spent $0.2 billion through 2012 on its Smart Energy program, and expects to spend an
additional $0.3 billion, following a phased approach, from 2013 through 2017.

R

EGULATION

Regulatory matters are a key aspect of CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses, particularly Consumers' rate cases and regulatory proceedings before the MPSC.
Important regulatory events and developments are summarized below.

•

Electric Rate
Case:

In June 2012, the MPSC authorized an annual rate increase of $118 million, based on a 10.3 percent authorized return
on equity. Consumers filed an application in September 2012 to reconcile the total revenues collected under rates self-implemented in December 2011 to those that would have been collected
under final rates. This reconciliation requests that the MPSC find that no refund is required.

Consumers
filed a new general electric rate case with the MPSC in September 2012, seeking an annual rate increase of $148 million, based on a 10.5 percent authorized return on equity. In
January 2013, Consumers supplemented its electric rate case application to reflect changes to its environmental compliance and generation outage plans, which reduced its requested annual rate increase
to $145 million.



In
this filing, Consumers requested authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance, and technology enhancements. Costs associated with these investments represent
85 percent of the total annual rate increase requested. The filing also seeks approval of several rate adjustment mechanisms, including a mechanism that would reconcile annually Consumers'
actual nonfuel revenues with the revenues approved by the MPSC, and a mechanism that would allow recovery in 2014 of an additional $82 million associated with incremental 2014 investments,
subject to reconciliation.

•

Gas Rate
Case:

In June 2012, the MPSC authorized an annual rate increase of $16 million, based on a 10.3 percent authorized return
on equity. In January 2013, the MPSC approved Consumers' reconciliation of the total revenues under rates self-implemented in March 2012 to those that would have been collected under the
final rates. As a result of the reconciliation, which found that a refund was required, Consumers had a $2 million regulatory liability recorded at December 31, 2012. Consumers will
refund this amount to customers in March 2013.

In
February 2013, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $49 million, based on a 10.5 percent authorized return on equity. The filing requested
authority to recover new investments in customer reliability, deliverability, safety, and system enhancements. Costs associated with these investments represent 120 percent of the total annual
rate increase requested; this amount is offset partially by reductions in the revenue requirement associated with working capital.

The
filing also seeks approval of several rate adjustment mechanisms, including a mechanism that would reconcile annually Consumers' actual nonfuel revenues with the revenues approved by the MPSC, and
a mechanism that would allow recovery of an additional $70 million associated
with additional investments in the period July 2014 through December 2015, subject to reconciliation.

•

Revenue Decoupling
Mechanisms:

In April 2012, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in an appeal filed by ABATE that disputed the MPSC's decision to
authorize an electric revenue decoupling mechanism for DTE Electric. The Court concluded that the MPSC lacks statutory authority to approve or direct the use of a revenue decoupling mechanism for
electric providers. As a result, Consumers determined that it no longer met the accounting criteria for recognition of a regulatory asset under an alternative revenue program and, at March 31,
2012, wrote off its $59 million electric revenue decoupling mechanism regulatory asset.

In
November 2012, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in an appeal of the MPSC's 2010 order in Consumers' electric rate case; this appeal had been filed by the Attorney General and ABATE. In light of
the Court's previous ruling that the MPSC does not have authority to authorize electric decoupling, the Court reversed the portion of the 2010 order related to Consumers' electric revenue decoupling
mechanism, substantiating Consumers' decision to write off its associated regulatory asset in March 2012. In addition, the Court remanded this portion of the electric rate case to the MPSC for further
proceedings.

In
September 2011, Consumers filed its first reconciliation of the gas revenue decoupling mechanism, requesting recovery of $16 million from customers for the period June 2010 through May 2011.
This mechanism was extended through April 2012 and was not



affected
by the Court of Appeals decision on electric decoupling. The gas revenue decoupling mechanism allowed Consumers to adjust future gas rates to the degree that actual average weather-adjusted
sales per customer differed from the rate order. In December 2012, the MPSC approved Consumers' reconciliation of the gas revenue decoupling mechanism for the full amount of its request for the period
June 2010 through May 2011. The MPSC authorized recovery over three months beginning in February 2013.

Consumers
filed its final reconciliation of the gas revenue decoupling mechanism in August 2012, requesting recovery of $17 million from customers for the period June 2011 through April 2012.
At December 31, 2012, Consumers had a $33 million regulatory asset recorded for gas revenue decoupling for the period June 2010 through April 2012.

•

DOE
Settlement:

In 2011, Consumers entered into an agreement with the DOE to settle its claims related to the DOE's failure to accept spent
nuclear fuel and filed an application with the MPSC regarding the allocation of the settlement amount. In December 2012, the MPSC authorized Consumers to refund to customers $23 million
previously collected through rates for spent nuclear fuel costs over a six-month period beginning in January 2013. The MPSC also authorized Consumers to utilize $85 million of the
settlement amount as recovery of Consumers' regulatory asset for the Big Rock ISFSI.

The
2008 Energy Law limits alternative electric supply to ten percent of Consumers' weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. At December 31, 2012, Consumers' electric
deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten percent limit. In February 2013, a bill was introduced to the Michigan Senate that, if enacted, would revise the 2008 Energy Law and allow customers on
the ROA program waiting list to switch their service to an alternative electric supplier. Presently, the proportion of Consumers' electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list
is 25 percent. The revision also proposes an increase in the cap of six percentage points per year from 2014 through 2016. Consumers is unable to predict the outcome of this legislative
proposal.

Environmental
regulation is another area of importance for CMS Energy and Consumers, and they are monitoring numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives, including initiatives to regulate
greenhouse gases, and related litigation.

In
2011, the EPA finalized CSAPR, which was intended to replace CAIR; however, due to litigation surrounding CSAPR, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a stay of CSAPR, stating that
CAIR would remain in place while the court considers the issues. In August 2012, the Court voided CSAPR and held that CAIR would remain in place until the EPA promulgated a new rule. A request by the
EPA for a rehearing of this ruling was denied.

Additionally,
in February 2012, the EPA published its final MACT emission standards for electric generating units, based on Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, calling the final rule MATS.
Although numerous parties, including the State of Michigan, have sought to extend the deadline of MATS, it is expected to take effect in 2015. CMS Energy and Consumers are continuing to assess the
impact and cost associated with these rules and developments.

In 2012, CMS Energy's net income available to common stockholders was $382 million, and diluted EPS were $1.42. This compares with net income available
to common stockholders of $415 million and diluted EPS of $1.58 in 2011. The main factors contributing to the decline in earnings in 2012 were the write-off of Consumers' electric
revenue decoupling mechanism regulatory asset, as discussed above, and the absence of a tax benefit recognized in 2011 related to the enactment of the MCIT, offset partially by improved operating
results at Consumers.

A
more detailed discussion of the factors affecting CMS Energy's and Consumers' performance can be found in the Results of Operations section that follows this Executive Overview.

CMS
Energy and Consumers believe that economic conditions in Michigan are improving. Although Michigan's economy continues to be affected by the recession and its impact on the state's automotive
industry and by high unemployment rates, there are indications that the recession has eased in Michigan. Consumers expects its electric sales to increase by about 0.5 to 1.0 percent annually
through 2017, driven largely by the continued rise in industrial production. Excluding the impacts of energy efficiency programs, Consumers expects its electric sales to increase by about 1.0 to
1.5 percent annually through 2017. Consumers is projecting that its gas sales will remain stable through 2017. This outlook reflects growth in gas demand offset by energy efficiency and
conservation.

As
Consumers seeks to continue to receive fair and timely regulatory treatment, delivering customer value will remain a key strategic priority. To keep costs down for its utility customers, Consumers
has set goals to achieve further annual productivity improvements. Additionally, Consumers will strive to give priority to capital investments that increase customer value or lower costs.

Consumers
expects to continue to have sufficient capacity to fund its investment-based growth plans. CMS Energy also expects its sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet its cash
requirements. CMS Energy and Consumers will continue to monitor developments in the financial and credit markets, as well as government policy responses to those developments, for potential
implications for their businesses and their future financial needs.

Electric deliveries and rate increases:

For 2012, electric delivery revenues increased $81 million compared with 2011. This increase was due to additional
revenues of $106 million resulting from the June 2012 rate order and from Consumers' self-implemented rate increase in December 2011, $19 million from higher deliveries in
2012, and a $46 million increase in other revenues, primarily from energy optimization and renewable energy programs. These increases were offset partially by a $59 million charge to
write off Consumers' electric decoupling mechanism regulatory asset, and the absence, in 2012, of $31 million of electric decoupling revenues



recognized
in 2011. Deliveries to end-use customers were 38.1 billion kWh in 2012 and 37.8 billion kWh in 2011.

For
2011, electric delivery revenues increased $25 million compared with 2010. This increase was due to additional revenues of $92 million resulting from a November 2010 rate increase
and a $20 million increase in other revenues, offset largely by the absence, in 2011, of $87 million of surcharges in 2010 to recover retirement benefit expenses and certain regulatory
assets. Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.8 billion kWh in 2011 and 37.7 billion kWh in 2010.

Other income, net of expenses:

For 2012, other income, net of expenses, decreased $16 million compared with 2011, due primarily to expenses related to a
2012 Michigan ballot proposal associated with renewable energy.

For
2011, other income decreased $16 million compared with 2010, due to a reduction in the return on certain regulatory assets as a result of their declining balances.

Maintenance and other operating expenses:

For 2012, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $5 million compared with 2011. This decrease
reflected the authorized recovery of $14 million associated with Consumers' cancelled coal-fueled plant, an $11 million decrease in service restoration costs, a
$12 million benefit related to Consumers' settlement with the DOE, and an $8 million decrease in uncollectible accounts expense. These decreases were offset partially by an
$18 million increase in energy optimization program costs, a $14 million increase in other operating expenses, including higher costs related to system reliability, and an
$8 million increase associated with voluntary separation program expenses.

For
2011, maintenance and other operating expenses increased $31 million compared with 2010. This increase was due to $28 million of higher service restoration costs, caused by a series
of unusually severe storms in 2011, a $15 million increase in energy optimization program costs, and an $11 million increase in uncollectible accounts expense. Additionally, forestry,
plant maintenance, and other operating expenses increased $31 million in 2011. These increases were offset partially by the absence, in 2011, of $32 million of retirement benefit
expenses that were recovered in revenues in 2010 and a $22 million impairment charge recorded in 2010 associated with Consumers' cancelled coal-fueled plant.

Depreciation and amortization:

For 2012, depreciation and amortization expense increased $47 million compared with 2011, due primarily to increased plant in
service and an increase in depreciation expense authorized in a June 2012 rate order.

For
2011, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $38 million compared with 2010, due to a $54 million decrease in amortization expense on certain regulatory assets, offset
partially by a $16 million increase in depreciation expense from increased plant in service.

General Taxes:

For 2012, general taxes increased $10 million compared with 2011, due primarily to the absence, in 2012, of a favorable outcome to a Michigan
single business tax audit recorded in 2011.

Interest Charges:

For 2012, interest charges decreased $12 million compared with 2011, due to lower average debt levels and lower average interest rates in
2012.

For
2011, interest charges decreased $8 million compared with 2010, primarily from the absence, in 2011, of interest expense on a Michigan use tax assessment.



Income taxes:

For 2012, income taxes increased $35 million compared with 2011. This increase was due to higher electric utility earnings, a change from the
MBT to the MCIT in January 2012, and the absence, in 2012, of a $4 million benefit related to the Medicare Part D Subsidy.

For
2011, income taxes increased $4 million compared with 2010, due to higher electric utility earnings.

Gas deliveries and rate increases:

For 2012, gas delivery revenues decreased $29 million compared with 2011. This decrease reflected a $43 million
reduction resulting from lower customer deliveries, due primarily to milder weather in early 2012, and a $5 million decrease in other revenues. These decreases were offset partially by
$19 million of additional revenues from rate increases. Gas deliveries, including transportation to end-use customers, were 259 bcf in 2012, a decrease of 28 bcf, or ten percent,
compared with 2011.

For
2011, gas delivery revenues increased $64 million compared with 2010. This increase reflected $11 million in additional revenues from a May 2011 rate increase and $28 million
from higher customer usage, of which $16 million was due to colder weather in 2011. In addition, surcharge and other miscellaneous revenues increased $25 million. Gas deliveries,
including transportation to end-use customers, were 287 bcf in 2011, an increase of 14 bcf, or five percent, compared with 2010.

Other income, net of expenses:

For 2011, other income decreased $9 million compared with 2010, due primarily to a reduction in interest income related to
secured lending agreements.

Maintenance and other operating expenses:

For 2012, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $8 million compared with 2011. This decrease was due
to an $8 million reduction in uncollectible accounts expense and a $4 million reduction in other operating expenses, offset partially by a $4 million increase associated with
voluntary separation program expenses.

For
2011, maintenance and other operating expenses increased $34 million compared with 2010. This increase was due to $24 million of higher energy optimization program costs, a
$6 million



increase
in uncollectible accounts expense, and $4 million in higher distribution operating expenses.

Depreciation and amortization:

For 2012, depreciation and amortization expense increased $4 million compared with 2011, and for 2011, depreciation and
amortization expense increased $8 million compared with 2010. Both increases were due to higher depreciation expense from increased plant in service.

General Taxes:

For 2012, general taxes increased $7 million compared with 2011, due primarily to the absence, in 2012, of a favorable outcome to a Michigan
single business tax audit recorded in 2011.

Interest Charges:

For 2012, interest charges decreased $8 million compared with 2011, due to lower average debt levels and lower average interest rates in
2012.

Income taxes:

For 2012, income taxes decreased $6 million compared with 2011, due primarily to lower gas utility earnings.

For
2011, income taxes increased $10 million compared with 2010, due to higher gas utility earnings and the absence, in 2011, of a $3 million benefit related to the Medicare
Part D subsidy.

For 2012, net income of the enterprises segment decreased $16 million compared with 2011, due to the absence, in 2012, of a $28 million income tax
benefit resulting from the enactment of the MCIT in May 2011, offset partially by $6 million of tax benefits due primarily to law changes related to Medicare Part D and by
$6 million of additional earnings from an insurance settlement received in 2012 and from improved operating results.

For
2011, net income of the enterprises segment decreased $4 million compared with 2010, due to the absence, in 2011, of a $31 million insurance settlement recovery and the absence of a
$9 million benefit related to the MBT, lower electric revenues of $14 million, and lower mark-to-market gains of $3 million. These after-tax
decreases were offset largely by a $28 million income tax benefit resulting from the enactment of
the MCIT in May 2011 and by the absence, in 2011, of a $25 million increase in the environmental remediation liability associated with Bay Harbor.

For 2012, corporate interest and other net expenses decreased $6 million compared with 2011, due primarily to higher net earnings at EnerBank.

For
2011, corporate interest and other net expenses decreased $37 million compared with 2010, due to a $10 million after-tax decrease in interest expense, reflecting reduced

$5 million after-tax reduction in premiums paid on the early retirement of debt. Also contributing to the decrease were lower income tax expense resulting partially from the
enactment of the MCIT in May 2011 and a $4 million benefit from the impact of a final Michigan single business tax assessment for the years 2004 through 2007 that resulted in a tax deficiency
less than the amount previously accrued.

For 2012, net cash provided by operating activities at CMS Energy increased $72 million compared with 2011, and net cash provided by operating activities
at Consumers increased $30 million compared with 2011. The increases were due primarily to the absence of a pension
fund contribution and the impact of lower gas prices on inventory purchased in 2012, offset partially by lower cash collections resulting from the increase in accumulated credits applied to customer
accounts in 2012.

For
2011, net cash provided by operating activities at CMS Energy increased $210 million compared with 2010, and net cash provided by operating activities at Consumers increased
$413 million compared with 2010. The increases were due primarily to lower pension contributions and decreased refunds paid to customers, offset partially by the impact of lower gas prices on
inventory sold in 2011. Additionally, at Consumers, net cash provided by operating activities increased due to lower income tax payments to CMS Energy in 2011.

For 2012, net cash provided by financing activities at CMS Energy increased $240 million compared with 2011 and net cash used in financing activities at
Consumers decreased $204 million compared with 2011. These changes were due primarily to proceeds from Consumers' revolving accounts receivable sales program and an increase in net debt
issuances to fund Consumers' capital investment program.

For
2011, net cash used in financing activities at CMS Energy increased $401 million compared with 2010 and net cash used in financing activities at Consumers increased by $339 million
compared with 2010. These increases were due primarily to a decrease in net proceeds from borrowings and, at Consumers, a lower stockholder's contribution from CMS Energy in 2011.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

CMS Energy uses dividends from its subsidiaries and external financing and capital transactions to invest in its utility and
non-utility businesses, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. The ability of CMS Energy's subsidiaries, including Consumers, to pay dividends to CMS Energy depends
upon each subsidiary's revenues, earnings, cash needs, and other factors. In addition, Consumers' ability to
pay dividends is restricted by certain terms included in its debt covenants and articles of incorporation, and potentially by provisions under the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act and FERC
requirements. For additional details on Consumers' dividend restrictions, see Note 5, Financings and Capitalization – Dividend Restrictions. For the year ended
December 31, 2012, Consumers paid $393 million in common stock dividends to CMS Energy.



In June 2011, CMS Energy entered into a continuous equity offering program under which CMS Energy may sell, from time to time in "at the market" offerings, common stock having
an aggregate sales price of up to $50 million. In June 2012 and June 2011, CMS Energy issued common stock under this program and received net proceeds of $15 million in each period.

Consumers
uses cash flows generated from operations and external financing transactions, as well as stockholder contributions from CMS Energy, to fund capital expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends,
contribute to its employee benefit plans, and fund its other obligations.

CMS
Energy's and Consumers' access to the financial and capital markets depends on their credit ratings and on market conditions. As evidenced by past financing transactions, CMS Energy and Consumers
have had ready access to these markets and, barring major market dislocations or disruptions, they expect to continue to have such access. If access to these markets were to become diminished or
otherwise restricted, however, CMS Energy and
Consumers would implement contingency plans to address debt maturities, which could include reduced capital spending. CMS Energy and Consumers had the following secured revolving credit facilities

CMS Energy and Consumers use these credit facilities for general working capital purposes and to issue letters of credit. An additional source of liquidity is
Consumers' revolving accounts receivable sales program, which allows it to transfer up to $250 million of accounts receivable as a secured borrowing. At December 31, 2012,
$140 million of accounts receivable were eligible for transfer under this program.

Certain
of CMS Energy's and Consumers' credit agreements, debt indentures, and other facilities contain covenants that require CMS Energy and Consumers to maintain certain financial ratios, as defined
therein. At December 31, 2012, no events of default had occurred with respect to any financial covenants contained in CMS Energy's and Consumers' credit

Long-term
contracts for purchase of commodities and related services, and construction and technology services. The commodities and
related services include natural gas and associated transportation, electricity, and coal and associated transportation.

CMS Energy and Consumers also have recognized non-current liabilities for which the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. These items,
which are excluded from the table above, include regulatory liabilities, deferred income taxes, workers compensation liabilities, accrued liabilities under renewable energy programs, and other
liabilities. Retirement benefits are also not included in the table above. For details related to benefit payments, see Note 12, Retirement Benefits.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements:

CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries also enter into various arrangements in the normal course of
business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, and financial and performance guarantees. Indemnities are
usually agreements to reimburse a counterparty that may incur losses due to outside claims or breach of contract terms. The maximum payment that could be required under a number of these indemnity



obligations
is not estimable; the maximum obligation under indemnities for which such amounts were estimable was $512 million at December 31, 2012. While CMS Energy and Consumers believe
it is unlikely that they will incur any material losses related to indemnities they have not recorded as liabilities, they cannot predict the impact of these contingent obligations on their liquidity
and financial condition. For additional details on these and other guarantee arrangements, see Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments – Guarantees.

Capital Expenditures:

Over the next five years, CMS Energy and Consumers expect to make capital investments about $7 billion, including $750 million
for Consumers' proposed new gas-fueled plant. CMS Energy and Consumers may revise their forecasts of capital expenditures periodically due to a number of factors, including environmental regulations,
business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and the ability to access capital. Presented in the following table are CMS Energy's and Consumers' estimated capital expenditures,
including lease commitments, for 2013 through 2017:

NCERTAINTIES

Balanced Energy Initiative:

Consumers continues to experience increasing demand for electricity due to Michigan's recovering economy and increased use of air
conditioning, consumer electronics, and other electric devices, offset partially by the predicted effects of energy efficiency and conservation. In July 2012, customers set a new all-time
peak demand record of 9,006 MW.



Consumers
plans to mothball seven of its smaller coal-fueled units in 2015. Consumers will continue to evaluate its options for the plants, which include:

•

installing more environmental equipment on the units to reduce emissions further in order to meet new environmental
standards and continue to operate the units;

•

seeking an extension of compliance deadlines for new environmental standards;

•

converting the units to natural gas instead of coal;

•

decommissioning the units; and

•

a combination of these options,
depending on customer needs and market conditions.

With
the potential closure of these plants, Consumers could experience a shortfall in generation capacity of up to 1,500 MW in 2015. In order to address future capacity requirements and growing
electric demand in Michigan, Consumers updated its balanced energy initiative, a comprehensive energy resource plan designed to meet the short-term and long-term electricity
needs of its customers through:

•

energy efficiency;

•

demand management;

•

expanded use of renewable
energy;

•

development of new power plants;

•

power or generating asset purchases to complement existing generating sources;
and

•

continued operation or upgrade of existing units.

In
December 2012, Consumers announced plans to build a 700-MW gas-fueled plant at its Thetford complex in Genesee County, Michigan and filed an air permit application with the
MDEQ for the proposed plant. Construction of the plant is contingent upon obtaining a Certificate of Necessity from the MPSC and environmental permits. Consumers expects the plant to be operational in
2017.

Renewable Energy Plan:

Consumers' renewable energy plan details how Consumers will meet REC and capacity standards prescribed by the 2008 Energy Law. This law
requires Consumers to obtain RECs in an amount equal to at least ten percent of its electric sales volume (estimated to be 3.5 million RECs annually) in 2015 and each year thereafter. RECs
represent proof that the associated electricity was generated from a renewable energy resource. Under its renewable energy plan, Consumers expects to meet its renewable energy requirement each year
with a combination of newly generated RECs and previously generated RECs carried over from prior years.

The
2008 Energy Law also requires Consumers to obtain 500 MW of capacity from renewable energy resources by the end of 2015, either through generation resources owned by Consumers or through
agreements to purchase capacity from other parties. To meet its renewable capacity requirements, Consumers expects to add more than 500 MW of owned or contracted renewable capacity. Through December
2012, Consumers has contracted for the purchase of 299 MW of nameplate capacity from renewable energy suppliers and owns 100 MW of nameplate capacity at its recently constructed Lake
Winds® Energy Park. The combination of the contracted and owned capacity represents 80 percent of the 2015 renewable capacity requirement. Consumers expects to meet the balance of
the requirement through the completion of its Cross Winds® Energy Park in Tuscola County, Michigan, which is scheduled to begin operations in late 2015.

The
extension of the tax credits for wind projects for which construction begins prior to December 31, 2013 could reduce significantly the cost of meeting the renewable requirements of



the
2008 Energy Law; however, the requirements to qualify for the credit are not yet fully defined. Consumers cannot predict the overall impact of this legislative change.

Energy Optimization Plan:

The 2008 Energy Law requires Consumers to achieve energy savings equivalent to annual sales reduction targets through at least 2015. The
targets are incremental with the goal of achieving a six percent reduction in customers' electricity use and a four percent reduction in customers' natural gas use by December 31, 2015. At
December 31, 2012, Consumers had met 61 percent of its electric goal and 68 percent of its natural gas goal. Under its energy optimization plan, Consumers provides its customers
with incentives to reduce usage by offering energy audits, rebates and discounts on purchases of highly efficient appliances, and other incentives and programs. Consumers estimates that, through its
gas and electric energy optimization programs, its customers realized $184 million in energy savings during 2012.

Electric Customer Deliveries and Revenue:

Consumers' electric customer deliveries are largely dependent on Michigan's economy, which has suffered from economic and
financial instability in the automotive and real estate sectors. Consumers believes economic conditions in Michigan are improving, and expects weather-adjusted electric deliveries to remain stable in
2013 compared with 2012.

Consumers
expects average electric delivery growth of about 0.5 to 1.0 percent annually over the next five years. This increase reflects growth in electric demand, offset partially by the
predicted effects of energy efficiency programs and appliance efficiency standards. Actual deliveries will depend on:

•

energy conservation measures and results of energy efficiency programs;

•

fluctuations in weather; and

•

changes in economic conditions, including utilization, expansion, or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population
trends, and housing activity.

Electric ROA:

The Customer Choice Act allows Consumers' electric customers to buy electric generation service from Consumers or from an alternative electric
supplier. The 2008 Energy Law revised the Customer Choice Act by limiting alternative electric supply to ten percent of Consumers' weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. At
December 31, 2012, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten percent limit and alternative electric suppliers were providing 777 MW of generation service to ROA
customers. Based on 2012 weather-adjusted retail sales, Consumers expects 2013 electric deliveries under the ROA program to be at a similar level to 2012.

In
February 2013, a bill was introduced to the Michigan Senate that, if enacted, would revise the 2008 Energy Law and allow customers on the ROA program waiting list to switch their service to an
alternative electric supplier. Presently, the proportion of Consumers' electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is 25 percent. The revision also proposes an
increase in the cap of six percentage points per year from 2014 through 2016. Consumers is unable to predict the outcome of this legislative proposal.

Electric Transmission:

In 2011, FERC issued an order in a rulemaking proceeding concerning regional electric transmission planning and cost allocations. Consumers
and several other electric utilities filed a joint petition seeking clarification/rehearing of FERC's order and opposing the allocation methodology. In May 2012, FERC issued an order denying the
utilities' clarification/rehearing requests on this order. Following this denial, Consumers and several other electric utilities filed a petition for review of FERC's order with the U.S. Court of
Appeals.



In
a related matter, in 2010, MISO filed and FERC approved a tariff revision proposing a cost allocation methodology for a new category of transmission projects. Under this tariff revision, the cost
of these new transmission projects will be spread proportionally across the Midwest Energy Market. Consumers believes that Michigan customers will bear additional costs under MISO's tariff without
receiving comparable benefits from these projects. In 2011, Consumers, along with the Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, DTE Electric, and other parties, filed a
petition for review of FERC's order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit following FERC's denial of their request for rehearing opposing the allocation methodology in the MISO tariff
revision. Regardless of the outcome of this appeal, Consumers expects to continue to recover transmission expenses, including those associated with the MISO tariff revision, through the PSCR process.

In
May 2012, ReliabilityFirst Corporation informed Consumers that Consumers may not be properly registered to meet certain NERC electric reliability standards. Consumers is assessing its registration
status, taking into consideration FERC's December 2012 order on the definition of a bulk electric system. In light of this order, Consumers is reviewing the status of its electric distribution assets
under FERC's modified test and also reviewing prior correspondence from ReliabilityFirst Corporation as to the potential classification of its assets as within a bulk electric system for reliability
purposes. Consumers presently does not expect the resolution of any issues in this area to result in material unrecoverable costs.

Governor's Energy Initiative:

Recently, the Michigan governor announced a process pursuant to which a series of reports are to be completed in December 2013
addressing energy efficiency, renewable energy, the electricity market and customer choice, and other subjects. The process is designed to help the governor and other lawmakers determine the state's
next steps regarding energy policies. A series of public hearings have been scheduled in 2013 to gather input. Consumers expects to participate actively in this process but cannot predict its outcome.

Electric Rate Matters:

Rate matters are critical to Consumers' electric utility business. For additional details on electric rate matters, see Note 3,
Regulatory Matters.

Pending Electric Rate Case:

In September 2012, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $148 million, based on a
10.5 percent authorized return on equity. In January 2013, Consumers supplemented its electric rate case application to reflect changes to its environmental compliance and generation outage
plans, which reduced its requested annual rate increase to $145 million.

In
this filing, Consumers requested authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance, and technology enhancements. Costs associated with these investments represent
85 percent of the total annual rate increase requested. The filing also seeks approval of several rate adjustment mechanisms, including a mechanism that would reconcile annually Consumers'
actual nonfuel revenues with the revenues approved by the MPSC, and a
mechanism that would allow recovery in 2014 of an additional $82 million associated with incremental 2014 investments, subject to reconciliation.

Pending Power Supply Cost Recovery Plan:

Consumers submitted its 2013 PSCR plan to the MPSC in September 2012, and in accordance with its proposed plan,
self-implemented the 2013 PSCR charge beginning in January 2013.

Electric Environmental Estimates:

Consumers' operations are subject to various state and federal environmental laws and regulations. Consumers estimates that it
will incur expenditures of



$1.1 billion
from 2013 through 2018 to continue to comply with the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and numerous state and federal environmental regulations. Consumers expects to recover these
costs in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. Consumers' primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters:

Air Quality:

In 2011, the EPA released CSAPR, a final replacement rule for CAIR, which requires Michigan and 27 other states to improve air quality by reducing
power plant emissions that, according to EPA computer models, contribute to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in other downwind states. In August 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
D.C. Circuit voided CSAPR and held that CAIR would remain in place until the EPA promulgated a new rule. A request by the EPA for a rehearing of this ruling was denied.

In
February 2012, the EPA published its final MACT emission standards for electric generating units, based on Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, calling the final rule MATS. Under MATS, all of
Consumers' existing coal-fueled electric generating units are required to add additional controls for hazardous air pollutants. Existing units, unless granted extensions, must meet the
standards by mid-April 2015. In October 2012, Consumers requested a one-year extension for the J.H. Campbell facility under both MATS and the Michigan Mercury Rule in
order to have adequate time to construct emissions controls. In November 2012, the MDEQ granted that request for MATS only, moving the compliance date to April 2016 for the J.H. Campbell
facility. The MDEQ has assured Consumers that an
extension will also be granted in writing for the Michigan Mercury Rule, but Consumers has not yet received the extension. In addition, in December 2012 Consumers also submitted one-year
MATS and Michigan Mercury Rule extension requests to the MDEQ for the B.C. Cobb, J.C. Weadock, and J.R. Whiting facilities to accommodate the potential for construction to
alleviate transmission or reliability concerns. Consumers has not yet received a response from the MDEQ to these requests.

Presently,
Consumers' strategy to comply with CAIR, CSAPR or its replacement rule, and MATS involves the installation of emission control equipment at some facilities and the suspension of operations
at others; however, Consumers continues to evaluate these rules in conjunction with other EPA rulemakings, litigation, and congressional action. This evaluation could result
in:

•

changes in environmental compliance costs related to Consumers' coal-fueled power plants;

•

a change in the fuel mix at coal-fueled and
oil-fueled power plants;

•

changes in how certain plants are used; and

•

the retirement, mothballing, or repowering with an
alternative fuel of some of Consumers' generating units.

The
MDEQ renewed and issued the B.C. Cobb Renewable Operating Permit in August 2011 after an extensive review and a public comment period. In October 2011, the Sierra Club and the Natural
Resources Defense Council filed a petition with the EPA to object to the MDEQ's issuance of the state Renewable Operating Permit, alleging that the facility is not in compliance with certain
provisions of the Clean Air Act, including NSR and Title V. Consumers responded to these allegations in December 2011. The EPA could either deny the petition outright or grant the petition and
remand the matter to the MDEQ for further action. The Sierra Club or the Natural Resources Defense Council could also file suit in federal district court seeking EPA action on the petition. Consumers
believes these claims are baseless, but is unable to predict the outcome of this petition.



Fine Particulate Matter:

In December 2012, the EPA finalized a rule that strengthens the air quality standard for fine particulate matter. Consumers expects
short-term impacts to be limited, but this new standard could give rise to air quality concerns in states downwind of Michigan and put pressure on Michigan and other Midwestern states to
reduce emissions further. Given its present strategy for CAIR and MATS compliance, however, Consumers will already be achieving significant reductions in emissions that contribute to the formation of
fine particulate matter.

Greenhouse Gases:

In the recent past, there have been numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the state, regional, and national levels that involve the
regulation of greenhouse gases. Consumers continues to monitor and comment on these initiatives and to follow litigation
involving greenhouse gases. Consumers believes Congress may eventually pass greenhouse gas legislation, but is unable to predict the form and timing of any final legislation.

In
2010, the EPA released its Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which sets greenhouse gas emissions limits that define when permits are required
for new and existing industrial facilities under NSR PSD and Title V Renewable Operating Permit programs. Numerous parties challenged this rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit. In June 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the Tailoring Rule and dismissed challenges to it and to three other greenhouse gas rules. Rehearing requests for these
rules were denied. Consumers does not expect to incur significant expenditures to comply with this rule.

In
March 2012, the EPA released its proposed "Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units" pursuant to Section 111 of the
Clean Air Act. This proposed rule applies only to new fossil-fuel-fired steam electric generating units. The standard would require that carbon dioxide emissions not exceed
those of a modern, efficient natural gas combined-cycle plant, regardless of fuel type. Consumers submitted comments on the proposed rule in June 2012 and the EPA is scheduled to finalize this rule by
April 2013. The EPA is also expected to propose emissions guidelines within the next one to three years for states to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing generating units under
Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. Under the expected schedule, states will be required to submit plans to the EPA within nine months of issuance of the final rule and guidelines. Consumers
will continue to monitor activity regarding any proposed regulations involving new source performance standards.

Litigation,
as well as federal laws, EPA regulations regarding greenhouse gases, or similar treaties, state laws, or rules, if enacted or ratified, could require Consumers to replace equipment,
install additional emission control equipment, purchase emission allowances, curtail operations, arrange for alternative sources of supply, or take other steps to manage or lower the emission of
greenhouse gases. Although associated capital or operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to
recover these costs and capital expenditures in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations.

In
2012, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fueled power plants owned by Consumers, excluding the portion of Campbell Unit 3 that is owned by others, were 16 million metric tons.
During the same period, coal-fueled plants owned by the enterprises segment emitted 620,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

CCRs:

In June 2010, the EPA proposed rules regulating CCRs, such as coal ash, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Recent communications from the EPA
stress the need



to
coordinate CCR rulemaking guidelines for steam electric generating plants under the Clean Water Act. A final CCR rule could be issued in 2014. Michigan already regulates CCRs as
low-hazard industrial waste. The EPA proposed a range of alternatives for regulating CCRs, including regulation as either a non-hazardous waste or a hazardous waste. If coal
ash were regulated as a hazardous waste, Consumers would likely cease the beneficial reuse of this product, which would result in a significant increase in the amount of coal ash requiring costly
disposal. Additionally, if the cost of upgrading existing coal ash disposal areas to meet hazardous waste landfill standards were to become economically prohibitive, existing coal ash disposal areas
could close, requiring Consumers to find costly alternative arrangements for disposal. Consumers is unable to predict the impacts from this wide range of possible outcomes, but significant
expenditures are likely.

Water:

In March 2011, the EPA issued a proposed rule to regulate existing electric generating plant cooling water intake systems under Section 316(b) of the
Clean Water Act aimed at reducing alleged harmful impacts on fish and shellfish. Consumers continues to evaluate this proposed rule and its potential impacts on Consumers' plants. A final rule is
expected in June 2013. Consumers also expects the EPA to propose new regulations in 2013 for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants that will require physical and/or chemical treatment
facilities for all wastewater. A final rule is expected in 2014.

PCBs:

In April 2010, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, indicating that it is considering a variety of regulatory actions with respect to
PCBs. One approach would aim to phase out equipment containing PCBs by 2025. Another approach would eliminate an exemption for small equipment containing PCBs. To comply with any such regulatory
actions, Consumers could incur substantial costs associated with existing electrical equipment potentially containing PCBs. A proposed rule is expected in 2013.

Other
electric environmental matters could have a major impact on Consumers' outlook. For additional details on other electric environmental matters, see Note 4, Contingencies and
Commitments – Consumers Electric Utility Contingencies – Electric Environmental Matters.

NCERTAINTIES

Gas Deliveries:

Consumers expects weather-adjusted gas deliveries in 2013 to grow by about two percent compared with 2012. Over the next five years, Consumers
expects average gas deliveries to remain stable. This outlook reflects modest growth in gas demand offset by the predicted effects of energy efficiency and conservation. Actual delivery levels from
year to year may vary from this trend due to:

•

fluctuations in weather;

•

use by independent power producers;

•

availability and development of renewable energy sources;

•

changes in gas prices;

•

Michigan economic conditions,
including population trends and housing activity;

•

the price of competing energy sources or fuels; and

•

energy efficiency
and conservation impacts.

Gas Transmission:

In January 2013, Consumers announced plans to build a 24-mile, 36-inch natural gas pipeline in St. Joseph and
Branch Counties, Michigan. Consumers expects to spend $150 million for this project. Construction of the pipeline is contingent upon obtaining approval



from
the MPSC and environmental permits. Consumers expects the pipeline to be operational by the end of 2014.

Gas Transportation:

In July 2012, Trunkline filed a proposal with FERC to cease transporting natural gas through one of its two main transmission pipelines serving
Michigan. More than 60 percent of the natural gas supplied to Consumers' gas customers is delivered by Trunkline's two main transmission pipelines. In August 2012, Consumers filed a motion with
FERC to protest against the proposed abandonment on the grounds that it would negatively impact customers and that it could hamper the development of gas-fueled electric generation in
Michigan. The Governor, the MPSC, and various other parties have also filed protests with FERC. If Trunkline's proposal is granted, the abandonment could result in higher gas prices and reduced
availability for Michigan gas customers.

Gas Rate Matters:

Rate matters are critical to Consumers' gas utility business. For additional details on Consumers' gas rate matters, see Note 3,
Regulatory Matters.

Pending Gas Rate Case:

In February 2013, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $49 million, based on a
10.5 percent authorized return on equity. The filing requested authority to recover new investments in customer reliability, deliverability, safety, and system enhancements. Costs associated
with these investments represent 120 percent of the
total annual rate increase requested; this amount is offset partially by reductions in the revenue requirement associated with working capital.

The
filing also seeks approval of several rate adjustment mechanisms, including a mechanism that would reconcile annually Consumers' actual nonfuel revenues with the revenues approved by the MPSC, and
a mechanism that would allow recovery of an additional $70 million associated with additional investments in the period July 2014 through December 2015, subject to reconciliation.

Gas Depreciation:

In August 2012, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement in Consumers' gas depreciation case. The depreciation rates, which became effective in
January 2013, will result in a $5 million decrease in annual gas depreciation expense for Consumers.

Pending Gas Cost Recovery Plan:

Consumers submitted its 2013-2014 GCR plan to the MPSC in December 2012, and in accordance with its proposed plan,
expects to self-implement the 2013-2014 GCR charge beginning in April 2013.

Gas Pipeline Safety:

In January 2012, President Obama signed the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011. The law reauthorizes existing
federal pipeline safety programs of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration through 2015 and it contains provisions mandating:

•

an increase in the maximum fine for safety violations to $2 million;

•

an increase in the number of pipeline inspectors;

•

a study regarding application of integrity management requirements outside of "high consequence areas;"

•

a survey regarding
existing plans for safe management and replacement of cast iron pipelines;

•

prescribed notification and on-site incident response times;

•

installation of automatic or remotely controlled shut-off valves on new or replaced pipelines where feasible;



•

historical design and construction documentation to verify maximum allowable operating pressures; and

•

establishment of new regulations
for testing (pressure tests or equivalent methods) of previously untested pipelines in
high-consequence areas.

Consumers
continues to comply with laws and regulations governing natural gas pipeline safety. These laws and regulations could cause Consumers to incur significant additional costs related to its
natural gas pipeline safety programs. Consumers expects that it would be able to recover the costs in rates, consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with laws and
regulations.

Gas Environmental Estimates:

Consumers expects to incur response activity costs at a number of sites, including 23 former MGP sites. For additional details, see
Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments – Consumers Gas Utility Contingencies – Gas Environmental Matters.

The
Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule requires facilities engaging in the distribution of natural gas to collect data on greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the combustion of natural
gas. In 2012, Consumers estimated that carbon dioxide emissions from its customers were 17 million metric tons.

Smart Energy:

Consumers' grid modernization effort continues. In August 2012, Consumers began installing smart meters in Muskegon County, Michigan. One of the
functions of smart meters is to allow customers to monitor and manage their energy usage, which should help reduce demand during critical peak times, resulting in lower peak capacity requirements. The
installation of smart meters should also provide for both operational and customer benefits. At December 31, 2012, Consumers had upgraded 53,000 residential and small business customers in
Muskegon County, Michigan to smart meters. Consumers expects to install about 175,000 smart meters throughout western Michigan in each of the years 2013 and 2014. By mid-2013, Consumers
should be able to begin reading meters remotely; further functionality will be added in 2013 and 2014. Consumers also plans to install communication modules on gas meters in areas where Consumers
provides both electricity and natural gas to customers.

EnerBank:

EnerBank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CMS Capital, is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured home
improvement loans. EnerBank represented two percent of CMS Energy's net assets at December 31, 2012, and four percent of CMS Energy's net income available to common stockholders for the year
ended December 31, 2012. The carrying value of EnerBank's loan portfolio was $544 million at December 31, 2012. Its loan portfolio was funded primarily by deposit liabilities of
$527 million. Twelve-month rolling average default rates on loans held by EnerBank have declined from 0.9 percent at December 31, 2011 to 0.8 percent at December 31,
2012. CMS Energy is required both by law and by contract to provide financial support, including infusing additional capital, to ensure that EnerBank satisfies mandated capital requirements and has
sufficient liquidity to operate. EnerBank has exceeded these requirements historically and exceeds them as of February 2013.

Voluntary Separation Program:

In April 2012, CMS Energy announced a voluntary separation program for its salaried employees. The separation date for the majority
of employees who participated in the program was July 1, 2012. Management approved 232 employees for early separation and CMS Energy recorded a charge of $12 million related to this
program during the year ended December 31, 2012.

Litigation:

CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries are named as parties in various litigation matters, as well as in administrative proceedings
before various courts and governmental agencies, arising in the ordinary course of business. For additional details regarding these and other legal matters, see Note 4, Contingencies and
Commitments and Note 3, Regulatory Matters.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The following accounting policies and related information are important to an understanding of CMS Energy's and Consumers' results of
operations and financial condition. For additional accounting policies, see Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies.

E

STIMATES

AND

A

SSUMPTIONS

In the preparation of CMS Energy's and Consumers' consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions are used that may affect reported amounts and
disclosures. CMS Energy and Consumers use accounting estimates for asset valuations, unbilled revenue, depreciation, amortization, financial and derivative instruments, employee benefits, stock-based
compensation, the effects of regulation, indemnities, and contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimated results due to changes in the regulatory environment, regulatory decisions, lawsuits,
competition, and other factors. CMS Energy and Consumers consider all relevant factors in making these assessments.



Asset Retirement Obligations:

CMS Energy and Consumers are required to record the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their useful lives if there
is a legal obligation to remove them. CMS Energy and Consumers have legal obligations to remove some of their assets at the end of their useful lives. CMS Energy and Consumers calculate the fair value
of ARO liabilities using an expected present value technique that reflects assumptions about costs, inflation, and profit margin that third parties would require to assume the obligation. For
additional details, see Note 11, Asset Retirement Obligations.

Contingencies:

CMS Energy and Consumers make judgments regarding the future outcome of various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. For such matters,
they record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably estimable, based on all available information. In particular, CMS Energy and Consumers are participating in various
environmental remediation projects for which they have recorded liabilities. The recorded amounts represent estimates that may take into account such considerations as the number of sites, the
anticipated scope, cost, and timing of remediation work, the available technology, applicable regulations, and the requirements of governmental authorities. For remediation projects in which the
timing of estimated expenditures is considered reliably determinable, CMS Energy and Consumers record the liability at its net present value, using a discount rate equal to the interest rate on
monetary assets that are essentially risk-free and have maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. The amount recorded for any contingency may differ from actual costs
incurred when the contingency is resolved.

Fair Value Measurements:

CMS Energy and Consumers have assets and liabilities that are accounted for or disclosed at fair value. Fair value measurements
incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Development of these assumptions may require significant judgment. For a
detailed discussion of the valuation techniques and inputs used to calculate fair value measurements, see Note 6, Fair Value Measurements. Details about the fair value measurements for the
Pension Plan and OPEB plan assets are included in Note 12, Retirement Benefits.

Income Taxes:

The amount of income taxes paid by CMS Energy is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in
proposed assessments. An estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMS Energy believes adequate reserves have been provided for these exposures; however,
future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential
assessments expire. Additionally, CMS Energy's judgment as to the ability to recover its deferred tax assets may change. CMS Energy believes the valuation allowances related to its deferred tax assets
are adequate, but future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments. As a result, CMS Energy's effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly over time.

Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments:

CMS Energy and Consumers assess the recoverability of their long-lived assets and equity
method investments by performing impairment tests if certain triggering events occur or if there has been a decline in value that may be other than temporary. CMS Energy and Consumers base their
evaluations of impairment on such indicators as:

•

the nature of the assets;

•

projected future economic benefits;

•

regulatory and political environments;



•

historical and future cash flow and profitability measurements; and

•

other external market conditions and factors.

The
estimates CMS Energy and Consumers use may change over time, which could have a material impact on their consolidated financial statements. For additional details, see Note 20, Asset Sales,
Discontinued Operations, and Impairment Charges.

Unbilled Revenues:

CMS Energy's and Consumers' customers are billed monthly in cycles having billing dates that do not generally coincide with the end of a
calendar month. This results in customers having received electricity or gas that they have not been billed for as of the month-end. Consumers estimates its unbilled revenues by applying
an average billed rate to total unbilled deliveries for each customer class. Unbilled revenues, which are recorded as accounts receivable on CMS Energy's and Consumers' consolidated balance sheets,
were $403 million at December 31, 2012 and $387 million at December 31, 2011.

EGULATION

Because Consumers has regulated operations, it uses regulatory accounting to recognize the effects of the regulators' decisions on its financial statements.
Consumers continually assesses whether future recovery of its regulatory assets is probable by considering communications and experience with its regulators and changes in the regulatory environment.
If Consumers determined that recovery of a regulatory asset were not probable, Consumers would be required to write off the asset and immediately recognize the expense in earnings.

Alternative-Revenue Programs:

The MPSC's 2009 gas rate case order authorized Consumers to implement a gas revenue decoupling mechanism. This mechanism, which was
extended through April 2012 in the 2010 gas rate case order, allowed Consumers to adjust future gas rates to the degree that actual average weather-adjusted sales per customer differed from the rate
order. Consumers accounted for this program as an alternative-revenue program that met the criteria for recognizing the effects of decoupling adjustments on revenue as gas is delivered.

In
2009, the MPSC approved an energy optimization incentive mechanism that provides a financial incentive if the energy savings of Consumers' customers exceed annual targets established by the MPSC.
Consumers accounts for this program as an alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing revenue related to the incentive as soon as energy savings exceed the annual targets
established by the MPSC.

Revenue Subject to Refund:

Unless prohibited by the MPSC upon a showing of good cause, Consumers is allowed to self-implement new energy rates six
months after a new rate case filing; however, the rates that Consumers self-implements may be subject to refund, with interest. Consumers recognizes revenue associated with
self-implemented rates. If Consumers considers it probable that it will be required to refund a portion of its self-implemented rates, it records a provision for revenue
subject to refund. A final rate order could differ materially from Consumers' estimates underlying its self-implemented rates, giving rise to accounting adjustments. Under accounting rules
for prior period adjustments, CMS Energy and Consumers may need to record such differences, if they are specifically identifiable to prior interim periods, as revisions to those periods.

Financial Instruments:

Debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value as determined from quoted market prices or other
observable, market-based inputs. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these securities are reported, net of tax, in equity as part of AOCI, except that unrealized losses
determined to be other than temporary are reported in earnings.

Derivative Instruments:

CMS Energy and Consumers account for certain contracts as derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if an instrument qualifies
for derivative accounting are complex and often require significant judgment in application. If a contract is a derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, it is
recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. Each quarter, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract. The fair values
calculated for CMS Energy's and Consumers' derivatives may change significantly as commodity prices and volatilities change. The cash returns actually realized on derivatives may be different from
their estimated fair values. For additional details on CMS Energy's and Consumers' derivatives and how the fair values of derivatives are determined, see Note 6, Fair Value Measurements.

Market Risk Information:

CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to market risks including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and
investment security prices. They may enter into various risk management contracts to limit exposure to these risks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. CMS Energy and Consumers
enter into these contracts using established policies and procedures, under the direction of an executive oversight committee consisting of senior management representatives and a risk committee
consisting of business unit managers.

The
following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from financial instruments, assuming a hypothetical adverse change in market rates or
prices of ten percent. Potential losses could exceed the amounts shown in the sensitivity analyses if changes in market rates or prices were to exceed ten percent.

Interest-Rate Risk:

CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to interest-rate risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate and
variable-rate financing instruments. CMS Energy and Consumers use a combination of these instruments, and may also enter into interest-rate swap agreements, in order to manage
this risk and to achieve a reasonable cost of capital.

ENEFITS

Pension:

CMS Energy and Consumers have external trust funds to provide retirement pension benefits to their employees under a non-contributory, defined
benefit Pension Plan. On September 1, 2005, the defined benefit Pension Plan was closed to new participants and CMS Energy and Consumers implemented the qualified DCCP, which provides an
employer contribution of six percent of base pay to the existing 401(k) plan. An employee contribution is not required to receive the plan's employer cash contribution. All employees hired on or after
September 1, 2005 participate in this plan as part of their retirement benefit program. Previous cash balance Pension Plan participants also participate in the DCCP as of September 1,
2005. Additional pay credits under the cash balance Pension Plan were discontinued as of that date.



401(k):

CMS Energy and Consumers provide an employer match in their 401(k) plan equal to 60 percent on eligible contributions up to the first six percent of
an employee's wages.

OPEB:

CMS Energy and Consumers provide postretirement health and life benefits under their OPEB plan to qualifying retired employees.

CMS
Energy and Consumers record liabilities for pension and OPEB on their consolidated balance sheets at the present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets. The calculation of the
liabilities and associated expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and requires many assumptions, including:

•

life expectancies;

•

discount rates;

•

expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets;

•

rate of compensation increases; and

•

expected health care costs.

A
change in these assumptions could change significantly CMS Energy's and Consumers' recorded liabilities and associated expenses.

Presented
in the following table are estimates of CMS Energy's and Consumers' pension cost, OPEB cost, and cash contributions through 2015:

Contribution estimates include amounts required and discretionary contributions. Consumers' pension and OPEB costs are recoverable through its general
ratemaking process. Actual future pension cost and contributions will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates, and various other factors related to the populations
participating in the Pension Plan.

Lowering
the expected long-term rate of return on the Pension Plan assets by 0.25 percentage point (from 7.75 percent to 7.50 percent) would increase estimated pension
cost for 2013 by $4 million for both CMS Energy and Consumers. Lowering the discount rate by 0.25 percentage point (from 4.10 percent to 3.85 percent) would increase
estimated pension cost for 2013 by $5 million for both CMS Energy and Consumers.

CMS Energy Corporation

Consumers Energy Company

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1:    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Corporate Structure:

CMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including
Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. CMS Energy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides.
CMS Energy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and enterprises, its non-utility investments and operations. Consumers operates principally in
two business segments: electric utility and gas utility.

Principles of Consolidation:

CMS Energy and Consumers prepare their consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. CMS Energy's consolidated financial
statements comprise CMS Energy, Consumers, CMS Enterprises, and all other entities in which CMS Energy has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Consumers' consolidated
financial statements comprise Consumers and all other entities in which it has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. CMS Energy uses the equity method of accounting for
investments in companies and partnerships that are not consolidated, where they have significant influence over operations and financial policies but are not the primary beneficiary. CMS Energy and
Consumers eliminate intercompany transactions and balances.

Use of Estimates:

CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make estimates using assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition Policy:

CMS Energy and Consumers recognize revenue from deliveries of electricity and natural gas, and from the transportation, processing, and
storage of natural gas, when services are provided. CMS Energy and Consumers record unbilled revenue for the estimated amount of energy delivered to customers but not yet billed. CMS Energy and
Consumers record sales tax net and exclude it from revenue. CMS Energy recognizes revenue on sales of marketed electricity, natural gas, and other energy products at delivery.

Alternative-Revenue Programs:

The MPSC's 2009 gas rate case order authorized Consumers to implement a gas revenue decoupling mechanism. This mechanism, which was
extended through
April 2012 in the 2010 gas rate case order, allowed Consumers to adjust future gas rates to the degree that actual average weather-adjusted sales per customer differed from the rate order. Consumers
accounted for this program as an alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing the effects of decoupling adjustments on revenue as gas is delivered. For details on Consumers'
decoupling mechanisms, see Note 3, Regulatory Matters.

In
2009, the MPSC approved an energy optimization incentive mechanism that provides a financial incentive if the energy savings of Consumers' customers exceed annual targets established by the MPSC.
Consumers accounts for this program as an alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing revenue related to the incentive as soon as energy savings exceed the annual targets
established by the MPSC.



Self-Implemented Rates:

Unless prohibited by the MPSC upon a showing of good cause, Consumers is allowed to self-implement new energy rates
six months after a new rate case filing if the MPSC has not issued an order in the case. The MPSC then has another six months to issue a final order. If the MPSC does not issue a final order within
that period, the filed rates are considered approved. If the MPSC issues a final order within that period, the rates that Consumers self-implemented may be subject to refund, with
interest. Consumers recognizes revenue associated with self-implemented rates. If Consumers considers it probable that it will be required to refund a portion of its
self-implemented rates, then Consumers records a provision for revenue subject to refund. For details on Consumers' self-implemented rates, see Note 3, Regulatory
Matters.

Accounts Receivable:

Accounts receivable comprise trade receivables and unbilled receivables. CMS Energy and Consumers record their accounts receivable at cost,
which approximates fair value. CMS Energy and Consumers establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses, management's assessment of existing economic conditions, customer
trends, and other factors. CMS Energy and Consumers assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on contractual past-due terms established with customers. CMS Energy and Consumers
charge off accounts deemed uncollectible to operating expense.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Contingencies:

CMS Energy and Consumers record estimated liabilities for contingencies on their consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. CMS Energy and Consumers expense legal fees as incurred; fees incurred but not yet billed are accrued based on
estimates of work performed. This policy also applies to any fees incurred on behalf of employees and officers under indemnification agreements; such fees are billed directly to CMS Energy or
Consumers.

Debt Issuance Costs, Discounts, Premiums, and Refinancing Costs:

CMS Energy and Consumers defer issuance costs, discounts, and premiums associated with
long-term debt and amortize those amounts over the terms of the debt issues. For the non-regulated portions of CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses, refinancing costs are
expensed as incurred. For the regulated portions of CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses, any remaining unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premiums associated with refinanced debt are
amortized over the term of the newly issued debt.

Derivative Instruments:

In order to support ongoing operations, CMS Energy and Consumers enter into contracts for the future purchase and sale of various
commodities, such as electricity, natural gas, and coal. These forward contracts are generally long-term in nature and result in physical delivery of the commodity at a contracted price.
Most of these contracts are not subject to derivative accounting because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of
electricity or bcf of natural gas);

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception; or

•

there is not an active
market for the commodity.

Consumers'
coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is not an active market for the coal it purchases. If an active market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts may
qualify as derivatives. Since Consumers is subject to regulatory accounting, the resulting fair



value
gains and losses would be deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities and would not affect net income.

CMS
Energy and Consumers record derivative contracts that do not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value on their consolidated balance sheets. Each reporting period, the
resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract. Since none of CMS Energy's or Consumers' derivatives has been designated as an accounting hedge, all
changes in fair value are reported in earnings. CMS Energy and Consumers did not have significant amounts recorded as derivative assets or liabilities at December 31, 2012 or 2011.
Additionally, the gains and losses recognized in earnings were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, or 2010.

Determination of Pension and OPEB MRV of Plan Assets:

CMS Energy and Consumers determine the MRV for Pension Plan assets as the fair value of plan assets on the
measurement date, adjusted by the gains or losses that will not be admitted into the MRV until future years. CMS Energy and Consumers reflect each year's gain or loss in the MRV in equal amounts over
a five-year period beginning on the date the original amount was determined. CMS Energy and Consumers determine the MRV for OPEB plan assets as the fair value of assets on the measurement
date. CMS Energy and Consumers use the MRV in the calculation of net pension and OPEB costs. For further details, see Note 12, Retirement Benefits.

Earnings Per Share:

CMS Energy calculates basic and diluted EPS using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential common stock
outstanding during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted EPS, includes the effects of dilutive stock options, warrants, and convertible securities. CMS Energy
computes the effect on potential common stock using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of antidilutive securities, which
are those securities resulting in an increase in EPS or a decrease in loss per share. For EPS computations, see Note 15, Earnings Per Share – CMS Energy.

Financial Instruments:

CMS Energy and Consumers record debt and equity securities classified as available for sale at fair value as determined from quoted market
prices or other observable, market-based inputs. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these securities are determined on a specific-identification basis. CMS Energy and
Consumers report unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of tax, in equity as part of AOCI, except that unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary are reported in earnings.
For additional details regarding financial instruments, see Note 7, Financial Instruments.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments:

CMS Energy and Consumers perform tests of impairment if certain triggering events occur,
or if there has been a decline in value that may be other than temporary.

CMS
Energy and Consumers evaluate long-lived assets held in use for impairment by calculating the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposition. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, CMS Energy and Consumers recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount
exceeds the fair value. CMS Energy and Consumers estimate the fair value of the asset using quoted market prices, market prices of similar assets, or discounted future cash flow analyses.



CMS
Energy also assesses equity method investments for impairment whenever there has been a decline in value that is other than temporary. This assessment requires CMS Energy to determine the fair
value of the equity method investment. CMS Energy determines fair value using valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, and assesses the ability of the investee to sustain an earnings
capacity that justifies the carrying amount of the investment. CMS Energy records an impairment if the fair value is less than the carrying amount and the decline in value is considered to be other
than temporary.

For
additional details, see Note 20, Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations, and Impairment Charges.

Inventory:

CMS Energy and Consumers use the weighted-average cost method for valuing working gas, recoverable base gas in underground storage facilities, and
materials and supplies inventory. CMS Energy and Consumers also use this method for valuing coal inventory, and they classify these amounts as generating plant fuel stock on their consolidated balance
sheets.

CMS
Energy and Consumers account for RECs and emission allowances as inventory and use the weighted-average cost method to remove amounts from inventory. RECs and emission allowances are used to
satisfy compliance obligations related to the generation of power.

CMS
Energy and Consumers use the lower-of-cost-or-market method to evaluate inventory for impairment.

MISO Transactions:

MISO requires the submission of hourly day-ahead and real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO
region. CMS Energy and Consumers account for MISO transactions on a net hourly basis in each of the real-time and day-ahead markets, netted across all MISO energy market
locations. CMS Energy and Consumers record net hourly purchases in purchased and interchange power and net hourly sales in operating revenue on their consolidated statements of income. They record net
billing adjustments upon receipt of settlement statements, record accruals for future net purchases and sales adjustments based on historical experience, and reconcile accruals to actual expenses and
sales upon receipt of settlement statements.

Property Taxes:

Property taxes are based on the taxable value of Consumers' real and personal property assessed by local taxing authorities. Consumers records
property tax expense over the fiscal year of the taxing authority for which the taxes are levied based on Consumers' budgeted customer sales. The deferred property tax balance represents the amount of
Consumers' accrued property tax that will be recognized over future governmental fiscal periods.

Reclassifications:

CMS Energy and Consumers have reclassified certain prior-period amounts on their consolidated financial statements to conform to the
presentation for the current period. These reclassifications did not affect consolidated net income or cash flows for the periods presented.

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents:

CMS Energy and Consumers have restricted cash and cash equivalents dedicated for repayment of Securitization bonds and for
payment under performance guarantees. CMS Energy and Consumers classify these amounts as a current asset if they relate to payments that could or will occur within one year.

CCOUNTING

S

TANDARDS

ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income:

This standard, which became effective January 1, 2012 for CMS Energy and Consumers,
eliminates the option of reporting other comprehensive income and its components on the statement of changes in equity. Prior to the implementation of this standard, both CMS Energy and Consumers used
this option for their consolidated financial statements. Under the standard, entities are required to present either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income, containing both net income
and components of other comprehensive income, or two separate consecutive statements. CMS Energy and Consumers have chosen to present two separate consecutive statements. This standard affects only
the presentation of comprehensive income on CMS Energy's and Consumers' consolidated financial statements.

ASU 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs:

This standard, which became
effective January 1, 2012 for CMS Energy and Consumers, is the result of a joint project of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board. The
primary objective of the standard is to ensure that fair value has the same meaning under GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards and to establish common fair value measurement guidance
in the two sets of standards. The standard does not change the overall fair value model in GAAP, but it amends various fair value principles and establishes additional disclosure requirements. This
standard did not impact CMS Energy's or Consumers' consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position, but did require additional disclosures.

3:    REGULATORY MATTERS

Regulatory matters are critical to Consumers. The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC
proceedings concerning Consumers, such as Consumers' rate cases and PSCR and GCR processes. These parties often challenge various aspects of those proceedings, including the prudence of Consumers'
policies and practices, and seek cost disallowances and other relief. The parties also have appealed significant MPSC orders. Depending upon the specific issues, the outcomes of rate cases and
proceedings, including judicial proceedings challenging MPSC orders or other actions, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of
operations. Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.

There
are multiple appeals pending that involve various issues concerning cost allocation among customers, the allocation of refunds among customer groups, the adequacy of the record evidence
supporting the recovery of Smart Energy investments, and other matters. Consumers is unable to predict the outcome of these appeals.

R

EGULATORY

SSETS

AND

L

IABILITIES

Because Consumers is subject to the actions of the MPSC and FERC, Consumers prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of
regulatory accounting. A utility must apply regulatory accounting when its rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services. Under regulatory accounting, Consumers records
regulatory assets or liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as expense or revenue by non-regulated businesses.



Presented
in the following table are the regulatory assets and liabilities on Consumers' consolidated balance sheets:

Gas Revenue Decoupling Mechanism:

The MPSC's 2009 gas rate case order authorized Consumers to implement a gas revenue decoupling mechanism. This mechanism, which
was extended through April 2012 in the 2010 gas rate case order, allowed Consumers to adjust future gas rates to the degree that actual average weather-adjusted sales per customer differed from the
rate order. This mechanism was not affected by a separate Michigan Court of Appeals decision on electric revenue decoupling.

In
September 2011, Consumers filed its first reconciliation of the gas revenue decoupling mechanism with the MPSC, requesting recovery of $16 million from customers for the period June 2010
through May 2011. In December 2012, the MPSC approved Consumers' reconciliation for the full amount of its request and authorized recovery over three months beginning in February 2013. In January
2013, ABATE filed an appeal with the Michigan Court of Appeals to dispute the MPSC's order in this case that Consumers is eligible to recover the portion of this amount allocated to transport
customers.

Consumers
filed its final reconciliation of the gas revenue decoupling mechanism in August 2012, requesting recovery of $17 million from customers for the period June 2011 through April 2012.

Energy Optimization Plan Incentive:

The MPSC has authorized Consumers to collect $15 million as an incentive payment for exceeding savings targets under
both its gas and electric optimization plans during 2011. The incentive will be collected over seven months beginning in June 2013.

During
2012, Consumers achieved 123 percent of its electric savings target and 132 percent of its gas savings target. For achieving these savings levels, Consumers will request the
MPSC's approval to collect $17 million, the maximum incentive, in the energy optimization reconciliation to be filed in May 2013.

Cancelled Coal-Fueled Plant Costs:

In its June 2012 order in Consumers' electric rate case, the MPSC authorized recovery of $14 million of
development costs associated with Consumers' proposed 830-MW coal-fueled plant. The MPSC authorized Consumers to recover these costs over a three-year period. In
September 2012, a party in Consumers' electric rate case filed an appeal with the Michigan Court of Appeals to dispute the MPSC's conclusion that authorized Consumers to recover these costs.

Postretirement Benefits:

As part of the ratemaking process, the MPSC allows Consumers to defer the impact of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs
associated with postretirement benefits as a regulatory asset and to recover these costs from customers. The asset will decrease as the deferred items are amortized and recognized as components of net
periodic benefit cost.



Securitized Costs:

In 2000, the MPSC authorized recovery of securitization and tax charges related to Consumers' Securitization bonds over a period of up to
15 years.

MGP Sites:

Consumers expects to incur environmental remediation and other response activity costs at 23 former MGP facilities. The MPSC allows Consumers to recover
from its natural gas customers over a ten-year period the costs incurred to remediate the MGP sites.

ARO:

The recovery of the underlying asset investments and related removal costs of recorded AROs are approved by the MPSC in depreciation rate cases. Consumers
records a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability for timing differences between the recognition of AROs for financial reporting purposes and the recovery of these costs from customers.

Unamortized Debt Costs:

Under regulatory accounting, any unamortized debt costs related to debt redeemed with the proceeds of new debt are capitalized and
amortized over the life of the new debt.

Gas Storage Inventory Adjustments:

Consumers incurs inventory expenses related to the loss of gas
from its natural gas storage fields. The MPSC allows Consumers to recover these costs from its natural gas customers over a five-year period.

Major Maintenance:

In its June 2012 order in Consumers' electric rate case, the MPSC allowed Consumers to defer major maintenance costs associated with certain
plants in excess of the costs approved in the rate order and recover these excess costs from customers, subject to MPSC approval.

Big Rock Nuclear Decommissioning and DOE Settlement:

Consumers had recorded an $85 million regulatory asset for $30 million it paid to Entergy to
assume ownership responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI and for $55 million of nuclear fuel storage costs it incurred as a result of the DOE's failure to accept nuclear fuel. Consumers filed a
complaint against the DOE in 2002 for this failure.

In
July 2011, Consumers entered into an agreement with the DOE to settle its claims for $120 million. In September 2011, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC requesting authority to
utilize $85 million of the settlement amount as recovery of its regulatory asset, and to refund to customers $23 million previously collected through rates for spent nuclear fuel costs.
In December 2012, the MPSC approved this treatment. Consumers will refund $23 million to customers over a six-month period beginning in January 2013. Consumers recognized the
remaining $12 million of the settlement as a reduction of maintenance and other operating expenses.

Electric Revenue Decoupling Mechanism:

The MPSC's 2009 electric rate case order authorized Consumers to implement an electric revenue decoupling mechanism. This
decoupling mechanism allowed Consumers to adjust future electric rates to the degree that actual average sales per customer differed from the rate order. At December 31, 2011, Consumers had
recorded a $59 million regulatory asset related to this mechanism.

In
April 2012, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in an appeal filed by ABATE that disputed the MPSC's decision to authorize an electric revenue decoupling mechanism for DTE Electric. The Court
concluded that the MPSC lacks statutory authority to approve or direct the use of a revenue decoupling mechanism for electric providers. As a result, Consumers determined that it no longer met the
accounting criteria for recognition of a regulatory asset under an alternative



revenue
program, and wrote off its $59 million electric revenue decoupling mechanism regulatory asset at March 31, 2012.

In
November 2012, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in an appeal of the MPSC's 2010 order in Consumers' electric rate case; this appeal had been filed by the Attorney General and ABATE. In light of
the Court's previous ruling that the MPSC does not have authority to authorize electric decoupling, the Court reversed the portion of the 2010 order related to Consumers' electric revenue decoupling
mechanism, substantiating Consumers' decision to write off its associated regulatory asset in March 2012. In addition, the Court remanded this portion of the electric rate case to the MPSC for further
proceedings.

Stranded Costs:

These costs represent fixed generation costs that were incurred in 2002 and 2003 to serve customers who elected to receive electricity from
alternative energy suppliers. In 2004, the MPSC approved the recovery of stranded costs from these customers. Consumers completed its recovery of the stranded cost surcharge in December 2012.

Cost of Removal:

These amounts have been collected from customers to fund future asset removal activities. This regulatory liability is reduced as costs of removal
are incurred.

Income Taxes, Net:

These costs represent the difference between deferred income taxes recognized for financial reporting purposes and amounts previously reflected
in Consumers' rates. This net balance will decrease over the remaining life of the related temporary differences and flow through current income tax benefit.

In
December 2012, Consumers assigned $792 million of assets in the VEBA trust to pay future prescription drug costs. This preserved the tax benefits lost upon enactment of the Health Care Acts.
As a result, Consumers remeasured its deferred income taxes and recognized an offsetting $151 million increase in regulatory liabilities.

Renewable Energy Plan:

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, surcharges collected from customers to fund Consumers' renewable energy plan exceeded Consumers'
spending. This regulatory liability is amortized as costs are incurred to operate and depreciate Consumers' wind farms and as Consumers purchases RECs under renewable energy purchase agreements.

Energy Optimization Plan:

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, surcharges collected from customers to fund Consumers' energy optimization plan exceeded Consumers'
spending. The associated regulatory liability is amortized as costs are incurred under Consumers' energy optimization plan.

In June 2012, the MPSC authorized an annual rate increase of $118 million, based on a 10.3 percent authorized return on equity.
Consumers filed an application in September 2012 to reconcile the total revenues collected during self-implementation to those that would have been collected under final rates. This
reconciliation requests that the MPSC find that no refund is required.



The annual rate increase authorized by the MPSC included a $20 million increase in annual depreciation expense resulting from the new depreciation rates that the MPSC

The PSCR and GCR processes are designed to allow Consumers to recover all of its power supply and purchased natural gas costs if incurred under reasonable and
prudent policies and practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. Consumers adjusts its PSCR and GCR billing factors monthly in order
to minimize the overrecovery or underrecovery amount in the annual reconciliations.

PSCR Plans:

In July 2012, the MPSC approved Consumers' 2011 PSCR plan, authorizing the 2011 PSCR charge that Consumers self-implemented beginning in
January 2011.

Consumers

CMS Energy and Consumers are involved in various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. Depending on the specific issues, the resolution of these
contingencies could have a material effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In their disclosures of these matters, CMS Energy and Consumers
provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss when such an estimate can be made. Disclosures that state that CMS Energy or Consumers cannot predict the outcome of a matter indicate that
they are unable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss for the matter.

Gas Index Price Reporting Investigation:

In 2002, CMS Energy notified appropriate regulatory and governmental agencies that some employees at CMS MST and CMS Field
Services appeared to have provided inaccurate information regarding natural gas trades to various energy industry publications which compile and report index prices. Although CMS Energy has not
received any formal notification that the DOJ has completed its investigation, the DOJ's last



request
for information occurred in 2003, and CMS Energy completed its response to this request in 2004. CMS Energy is unable to predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation and what effect, if any,
the investigation will have on CMS Energy.

Gas Index Price Reporting Litigation:

CMS Energy, along with CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas, Inc., and Cantera Gas Company, are named as
defendants in various lawsuits arising as a result of alleged inaccurate natural gas price reporting to publications that report trade information. Allegations include manipulation of NYMEX natural
gas futures and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. The following
provides more detail on these proceedings:

•

In 2005, CMS Energy, CMS MST, and CMS Field Services were named as defendants in a putative class action filed in Kansas
state court, Learjet, Inc., et al. v. Oneok, Inc., et al. The complaint alleges that during the putative class period, January 1, 2000 through October 31, 2002, the
defendants engaged in a scheme to violate the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The plaintiffs are seeking statutory full consideration damages consisting of the full consideration paid by plaintiffs for
natural gas allegedly purchased from defendants.

•

In 2007, a class action complaint, Heartland Regional Medical Center, et al. v. Oneok, Inc. et al., was filed in
Missouri state court alleging violations of Missouri antitrust laws. Defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS Field Services, and CMS MST, are alleged to have violated the Missouri antitrust law in
connection with their natural gas reporting activities.

•

Breckenridge Brewery of Colorado, LLC and BBD Acquisition Co. v. Oneok, Inc., et al., a class action
complaint brought on behalf of retail direct purchasers of natural gas in Colorado, was filed in Colorado state court in 2006. Defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS Field Services, and CMS MST, are
alleged to have violated the Colorado Antitrust Act of 1992 in connection with their natural gas reporting activities. Plaintiffs are seeking full refund damages.

•

A class action complaint, Arandell Corp., et al. v. XCEL Energy Inc., et al., was filed in 2006 in Wisconsin state
court on behalf of Wisconsin commercial entities that purchased natural gas between January 1, 2000 and October 31, 2002. The defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS ERM, and Cantera Gas
Company, are alleged to have violated Wisconsin's antitrust statute. The plaintiffs are seeking full consideration damages, plus exemplary damages and attorneys' fees. After dismissal on
jurisdictional grounds in 2009, plaintiffs filed a new complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. In 2010, the MDL judge issued an opinion and order granting the CMS
Energy defendants' motion to dismiss the Michigan complaint on statute-of-limitations grounds and all CMS Energy defendants have been dismissed from the Arandell (Michigan)
action.

•

Another class action complaint, Newpage Wisconsin System v. CMS ERM, et al., was filed in 2009 in circuit court in Wood
County, Wisconsin, against CMS Energy, CMS ERM, Cantera Gas Company, and others. The plaintiff is seeking full consideration damages, treble damages, costs, interest, and attorneys' fees.



•

In 2005, J.P. Morgan Trust Company, in its capacity as Trustee of the FLI Liquidating Trust, filed an action in Kansas
state court against CMS Energy, CMS MST, CMS Field Services, and others. The complaint alleges various claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The plaintiff is seeking statutory full
consideration damages for its purchases of natural gas in 2000 and 2001.

After
removal to federal court, all of the cases described above were transferred to the MDL. CMS Energy was dismissed from the Learjet, Heartland, and J.P. Morgan cases in 2009, but other CMS Energy
defendants remained parties. All CMS Energy defendants were dismissed from the Breckenridge case in 2009. In 2010, CMS Energy and Cantera Gas Company were dismissed from the Newpage case and the
Arandell (Wisconsin) case was reinstated against CMS ERM. In July 2011, all claims against remaining CMS Energy defendants in the MDL cases were dismissed based on FERC preemption. Plaintiffs have
filed appeals in all of the cases. The issues on appeal are whether the district court erred in dismissing the cases based on FERC preemption and denying the plaintiffs' motions for leave to amend
their complaints to add a federal Sherman Act antitrust claim. The plaintiffs did not appeal the dismissal of CMS Energy as a defendant in these cases, but other CMS Energy entities remain as
defendants. Oral argument on the appeal was held before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in October 2012.

These
cases involve complex facts, a large number of similarly situated defendants with different factual positions, and multiple jurisdictions. Presently, any estimate of liability would be highly
speculative; the amount of CMS Energy's possible loss would be based on widely varying models previously untested in this context. If the outcome after appeals is unfavorable, these cases could have a
material adverse impact on CMS Energy's liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

Bay Harbor:

CMS Energy retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection and treatment of leachate at Bay Harbor after selling its interests in the
development in 2002. Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. In June 2012, CMS Energy and the MDEQ finalized an
agreement that established the final remedies and the future release criteria at the site. CMS Energy is in the process of completing all construction necessary to implement the remedies required by
the agreement and will continue to maintain and operate a system to discharge treated leachate into Little Traverse Bay under an NPDES permit issued in 2010. This permit requires renewal every five
years.

Various
claims have been brought against CMS Land or its affiliates, including CMS Energy, alleging environmental damage to property, loss of property value, insufficient disclosure of environmental
matters, breach of agreement relating to access, or other matters. In October 2010, CMS Land and other parties received a demand for payment from the EPA in the amount of $7 million, plus
interest, whereby the EPA is seeking recovery, as allowed under Superfund, of
the EPA's response costs incurred at the Bay Harbor site. CMS Land communicated to the EPA in November 2010 that it does not believe that this is a valid claim.

CMS
Energy has recorded a cumulative charge related to Bay Harbor of $227 million, which includes accretion expense. At December 31, 2012, CMS Energy had a recorded liability of
$61 million for its remaining obligations. CMS Energy calculated this liability based on discounted projected costs, using a discount rate of 4.34 percent and an inflation rate of one
percent on annual operating and maintenance costs. CMS Energy based the discount rate on the interest rate for 30-year U.S. Treasury securities at December 31, 2010. The
undiscounted



amount
of the remaining obligation is $80 million. CMS Energy expects to pay $12 million in 2013, $4 million in each of 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, and the remaining amount
thereafter on long-term liquid disposal and operating and maintenance costs.

CMS
Energy's estimate of response activity costs and the timing of expenditures could change if there are additional major changes in circumstances or assumptions, including but not limited
to:

•

a significant increase in the cost of the present long-term water disposal strategy;

•

requirements to alter the present long-term water
disposal strategy upon expiration of the NPDES permit if the
MDEQ or EPA identify a more suitable alternative;

•

an increase in the number of contamination areas;

•

the nature and extent
of contamination;

•

delays in the receipt of requested permits;

•

delays following the receipt of any requested permits due to
legal appeals of third parties;

•

unanticipated difficulties in meeting the technical commitments in the agreement with the MDEQ;

•

additional or new legal or regulatory requirements; or

•

new or different landowner claims.

Depending
on the size of any indemnity obligation or liability under environmental laws, an adverse outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's liquidity and financial
condition and could negatively affect CMS Energy's financial results. Although a liability for its present estimate of remaining response activity costs has been recorded, CMS Energy cannot predict
the ultimate financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Equatorial Guinea Tax Claim:

In January 2002, CMS Energy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea
claims that CMS Energy owes $142 million in taxes, plus interest, in connection with the sale. CMS Energy has concluded that the government's tax claim is without merit. The government of
Equatorial Guinea indicated through a request for arbitration in October 2011 that it still intends to pursue its claim. CMS Energy is vigorously contesting the claim, and cannot predict the financial
impact or outcome of this matter.

Panhandle Tax Indemnification:

CMS Energy recorded a liability in 2003 for an indemnification provided in conjunction with the sale of Panhandle. As of
March 31, 2012 the statute of limitations had expired for this indemnification. Accordingly, CMS Energy eliminated the liability during the year ended December 31, 2012 and recognized an
after-tax benefit of $7 million in discontinued operations.

Electric Environmental Matters:

Consumers' operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations. Historically, Consumers has generally been able to
recover, in customer rates, the costs to operate its facilities in compliance with these laws and regulations.

Cleanup and Solid Waste:

Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under NREPA. Consumers believes that these
costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. Consumers estimates that its liability for NREPA sites will be between $4 million and $6 million. At
December 31, 2012, Consumers



had
a recorded liability of $4 million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable NREPA liability.

Consumers
is a potentially responsible party at a number of contaminated sites administered under the Superfund. Superfund liability is joint and several. In 2010, Consumers received official
notification from the EPA that identified Consumers as a potentially responsible party for cleanup of PCBs at the Kalamazoo River Superfund site. The notification claimed that the EPA has reason to
believe that Consumers disposed of PCBs and arranged for the disposal and treatment of PCB-containing materials at portions of the site. In April 2011, Consumers received a
follow-up letter from the EPA requesting that Consumers agree to participate in a removal action plan along with several other companies for an area of lower Portage Creek, which is
connected to the Kalamazoo River. All parties, including Consumers, that were asked to participate in the removal action plan declined to accept liability. In August 2011, the EPA announced that it
would proceed with the removal action plan and would continue to pursue potentially responsible parties to perform or pay for some or all of the
work. Until further information is received from the EPA, Consumers is unable to estimate a range of potential liability for cleanup of the river.

Based
on its experience, Consumers estimates that its share of the total liability for other known Superfund sites will be between $2 million and $8 million. Various factors, including
the number of potentially responsible parties involved with each site, affect Consumers' share of the total liability. At December 31, 2012, Consumers had a recorded liability of
$2 million for its share of the total liability at these sites, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable Superfund liability.

The
timing of payments related to Consumers' remediation and other response activities at its Superfund and NREPA sites is uncertain. Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. Any
significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, different remediation techniques, the nature and extent of contamination, and legal and regulatory
requirements, could affect its estimates of NREPA and Superfund liability.

Ludington PCB:

In 1998, during routine maintenance activities, Consumers identified PCB as a component in certain paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington.
Consumers removed and replaced part of the PCB material with non-PCB material. Consumers has had several communications with the EPA regarding this matter. Consumers is not able to predict
when the EPA will issue a final ruling and cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Electric Utility Plant Air Permit Issues and Notices of Violation:

In 2007, Consumers received an NOV/FOV from the EPA alleging that fourteen utility boilers
exceeded the visible emission limits in their associated air permits. Consumers has responded formally to the NOV/FOV denying the allegations. In addition, in 2008, Consumers received an NOV for three
of its coal-fueled facilities alleging, among other things, violations of NSR PSD regulations relating to ten projects from 1986 to 1998 allegedly subject to review under the NSR. The EPA
has alleged that some utilities have classified incorrectly major plant modifications as RMRR rather than seeking permits from the EPA or state regulatory agencies to modify their plants. Consumers
responded to the information requests from the EPA on this subject in the past. Consumers believes that it has properly interpreted the requirements of RMRR.

Consumers
is engaged in discussions with the EPA on all of these matters. Depending upon the outcome of these discussions, the EPA could bring legal action against Consumers and/or Consumers could be
required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of



its
coal-fueled electric generating plants, surrender emission allowances, engage in Supplemental Environmental Projects, and/or pay fines. Additionally, Consumers would need to assess the
viability of continuing operations at certain plants. The potential costs relating to these matters could be material. Consumers expects that it would be able to recover some or all of the costs in
rates, consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations, but cannot reasonably estimate the extent of cost recovery. Although Consumers
cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of the entirety of these discussions, it does not expect any future loss from civil penalties and/or Supplemental Environmental Projects to be material.

Nuclear Matters:

The matters discussed in this section relate to Consumers' previously owned nuclear generating plants.

In
1997, a U.S. Court of Appeals decision confirmed that the DOE was to begin accepting deliveries of spent nuclear fuel for disposal by January 1998. Subsequent U.S. Court of Appeals litigation, in
which Consumers and other utilities participated, had not been successful in producing more specific relief for the DOE's failure to accept the spent nuclear fuel. A number of court decisions have
supported the right of utilities to pursue damage claims in the U.S. Court of Claims against the DOE. Consumers filed a complaint in 2002 for damages resulting from the DOE's failure to accept spent
nuclear fuel from Palisades and Big Rock.

In
July 2011, Consumers entered into an agreement with the DOE to settle its claims for $120 million. As part of this agreement, Consumers also settled its liability to the DOE to fund the
disposal of spent nuclear fuel used at Palisades and Big Rock before 1983. In December 2012, the MPSC issued an order establishing the regulatory treatment of the settlement amount. In this order, the
MPSC also relieved Consumers of its obligation to establish an independent trust fund for the amount that was payable to the DOE prior to the settlement. For further information on this order, see
Note 3, Regulatory Matters.

In
September 2012, Entergy, which purchased Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI from Consumers in 2007, filed a lawsuit against the DOE for damages resulting from the DOE's delay in receiving spent
nuclear fuel from those plants, dating from the close of the sale. Under Consumers' sales agreement relating to Big Rock and Palisades, Consumers paid Entergy $30 million to assume ownership
and responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI, and Consumers also reserved any claim against the DOE for the first $30 million in damages related to the Big Rock ISFSI that occurred following the
sale close. Entergy's damages claim, as presently stated,
includes a claim for this Big Rock amount. Although Consumers believes Entergy has no valid claim for the $30 million Big Rock amount, in the event that Entergy were successful in recovering
the $30 million from the DOE, the DOE would have the ability to recoup the payment from Consumers. In order to protect its interests, Consumers has filed a motion to intervene in Entergy's
lawsuit against the DOE. Consumers cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

portion of the original site.



At December 31, 2012, Consumers had a recorded liability of $122 million for its remaining obligations for these sites. This amount represents the present value
of long-term projected costs, using a discount rate of 2.57 percent and an inflation rate of 2.5 percent. Consumers based the discount rate on the interest rate for
20-year U.S. Treasury securities at December 31, 2011. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is $134 million. Consumers expects to incur remediation and other

in remediation techniques, or legal and regulatory requirements, could affect Consumers' estimates of annual response activity costs and the MGP liability.

Pursuant
to orders issued by the MPSC, Consumers defers its MGP-related remediation costs and recovers them from its customers over a ten-year period. At December 31,
2012, Consumers had a regulatory asset of $152 million related to the MGP sites.

Other Environmental Matters:

Consumers initiated preliminary investigations during 2012 at a number of potentially contaminated sites it presently owns with the
intention of determining whether any contamination exists and the extent of any identified contamination. The sites being investigated include combustion turbine sites, generating sites, compressor
stations, and above-ground storage tanks. Consumers will continue its preliminary investigations at potentially contaminated sites through 2013. Consumers cannot predict an outcome at this stage of
the investigations.

Consumers, indemnified the purchaser for losses resulting from various matters, including claims related to tax disputes, claims related to power purchase agreements, and defects in title to the
assets or stock sold to the purchaser by CMS Energy subsidiaries. Except for items described elsewhere in this Note, CMS Energy believes the likelihood of material loss to be remote for the indemnity
obligations not recorded as liabilities.

lawsuits and proceedings may involve personal injury, property damage, contracts, environmental matters, federal and state taxes, rates, licensing, employment, and other matters. Further, CMS Energy
and Consumers occasionally self-report certain regulatory non-compliance matters that may or may not eventually result in administrative proceedings. CMS Energy and Consumers
believe that the outcome of any one of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on their consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

The MCV PPA:

Consumers has a 35-year PPA that began in 1990 with the MCV Partnership to purchase 1,240 MW of electricity. The MCV PPA, as amended and
restated, provides for:

•

a capacity charge of $10.14 per MWh of available capacity;

•

a fixed energy charge based on Consumers' annual average baseload coal
generating plant operating and maintenance cost,
fuel inventory, and average administrative and general expenses;

•

a variable energy charge for all delivered energy that reflects the MCV Partnership's cost of production;

•

a $5 million annual contribution by the MCV Partnership to a renewable resources program; and

•

an option for Consumers
to extend the MCV PPA for five years or purchase the MCV Facility at the conclusion of the MCV
PPA's term in March 2025.

Capacity
and energy charges under the MCV PPA were $319 million in 2012, $292 million in 2011, and $285 million in 2010. Consumers estimates that capacity and energy charges under
the MCV PPA will average $250 million annually. These amounts are included in the table above.

The Palisades PPA:

Consumers has a PPA expiring in 2022 with Entergy to purchase all of the capacity and energy produced by Palisades, up to the annual average
capacity of 798 MW. Consumers estimates that capacity and energy payments under the Palisades PPA will average $360 million annually. A portion of these amounts is included in the table above.
Consumers' total purchases of capacity and energy under the PPA were $331 million in 2012, $311 million in 2011, and $286 million in 2010. For further details about Palisades, see

Outstanding
borrowings bear interest at an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.50 percent (2.71 percent at December 31,
2012). CMS Energy used these proceeds to retire the 7.75 percent Trust Preferred Securities and floating-rate senior notes due January 2013. In February 2013, the term loan facility
was amended, reducing the annual interest rate to LIBOR plus 2.00 percent.


In
June 2012, Consumers entered into a short-term credit agreement permitting Consumers to borrow up to $375 million. This
agreement was terminated using proceeds from FMBs issued in December 2012.


In
August 2012, Consumers utilized the Michigan Strategic Fund for the issuance of $68 million and $35 million of
tax-exempt Michigan Strategic Fund revenue bonds. The bonds, which are backed by letters of credit and collateralized by Consumers' FMBs, are subject to optional tender by the holders that
would result in remarketing. Consumers used the proceeds to redeem $103 million of tax-exempt bonds in August 2012.


CMS
Energy's contingently convertible notes. See the "Contingently Convertible Securities" section in this Note for further discussion of the
conversions.



FMBs:

Consumers secures its FMBs by a mortgage and lien on substantially all of its property. Consumers' ability to issue FMBs is restricted by certain provisions
in the First Mortgage Bond Indenture and the need for regulatory approvals under federal law. Restrictive issuance provisions in the First Mortgage Bond Indenture include achieving a
two-times interest coverage ratio and having sufficient unfunded net property additions.

Regulatory Authorization for Financings:

FERC has authorized Consumers to have outstanding at any one time, up to $500 million of secured and unsecured
short-term securities for general corporate purposes. The remaining availability was $500 million at December 31, 2012. FERC has also authorized Consumers to issue and sell
up to $1.9 billion of secured and unsecured long-term securities for general corporate purposes. The remaining availability was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2012. The
authorizations are for the period ending June 30, 2014. Any long-term issuances during the authorization period are exempt from FERC's competitive bidding and negotiated placement
requirements.

Securitization Bonds:

Certain regulatory assets owned by Consumers' subsidiary Consumers Funding collateralize Consumers' Securitization bonds. The bondholders
have no recourse to Consumers' other assets. Through its rate structure, Consumers bills customers for Securitization surcharges to fund the payment of principal, interest, and other related expenses.
The surcharges collected are remitted to a trustee and are not available to creditors of Consumers or creditors of Consumers' affiliates other than Consumers Funding.

Debt Maturities:

At December 31, 2012, the aggregate annual contractual maturities for long-term debt for the next five years were:

2012 were $12 million, with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 2.26 percent, representing LIBOR plus 2.00 percent.


Obligations
under this facility are secured by FMBs of Consumers.



Short-term Borrowings:

Under Consumers' revolving accounts receivable sales program, Consumers may transfer up to $250 million of accounts
receivable, subject to certain eligibility requirements. These transactions are accounted for as short-term secured borrowings. At December 31, 2012, $140 million of accounts
receivable were eligible for transfer, and $110 million had been transferred under the program. During the year ended December 31, 2012, Consumers' average short-term
borrowings totaled $20 million, with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.94 percent.

The securities become convertible for a calendar quarter if the price of CMS Energy's common stock remains at or above the trigger price for 20 of 30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous quarter. The trigger price at which these securities become convertible is 130 percent of the conversion price. The
conversion and trigger prices are subject to adjustments in certain circumstances, including payments or distributions to CMS Energy's common stockholders. The conversion and trigger price adjustment
is made when the cumulative change in conversion and trigger prices is one percent or more. During 20 of the last 30 trading days ended December 31, 2012, the adjusted trigger-price
contingencies were met for the contingently convertible senior notes, and as a result, the senior notes are convertible at the option of the note holders for the three months ending March 31,
2013.

CMS
Energy's contingently convertible securities, if converted, require CMS Energy to pay cash up to the principal amount of the securities. Any conversion value in excess of the principal amount can
be paid in cash or in shares of CMS Energy's common stock, at the election of CMS Energy.

Dividend Restrictions:

Under provisions of CMS Energy's senior notes indenture, at December 31, 2012, payment of common stock dividends by CMS Energy was
limited to $1.4 billion.

Under
the provisions of its articles of incorporation, at December 31, 2012, Consumers had $536 million of unrestricted retained earnings available to pay common stock dividends to CMS
Energy. Provisions of the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act appear to restrict



dividends
payable by Consumers to the amount of Consumers' retained earnings. Several decisions from FERC suggest that under a variety of circumstances common stock dividends from Consumers would not
be limited to amounts in Consumers' retained earnings. Any decision by Consumers to pay common stock dividends in excess of retained earnings would be based on specific facts and circumstances and
would result only after a formal regulatory filing process.

For
the year ended December 31, 2012, CMS Energy received $393 million of common stock dividends from Consumers.

Capitalization:

The authorized capital stock of CMS Energy consists of:

•

350 million shares of CMS Energy Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and

•

10 million shares of CMS Energy Preferred
Stock, par value $0.01 per share.

Issuance of Common Stock:

In June 2011, CMS Energy entered into a continuous equity offering program under which CMS Energy may sell, from time to time in "at the
market" offerings, common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $50 million. In June 2012, under this program, CMS Energy issued 650,235 shares of common stock at an average price of
$23.07 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $15 million. CMS Energy has issued a total of 1,413,160 shares of common stock under this program, resulting in net proceeds of
$30 million.

6:    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants. When measuring fair value, CMS Energy and Consumers are required to incorporate all assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including
assumptions about risk. A fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs used to measure fair value according to their observability in the market. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as
follows:

•

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 inputs are observable, market-based inputs, other than Level 1 prices. Level 2 inputs may
include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in inactive markets, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.



•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect CMS Energy's or Consumers' own assumptions about how market
participants would value their assets and liabilities.

To
the extent possible, CMS Energy and Consumers use quoted market prices or other observable market pricing data in valuing assets and liabilities measured at fair value. If this information is
unavailable, they use market-corroborated data or reasonable estimates about market participant assumptions. CMS Energy and Consumers classify fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy
based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents consist of money market funds with daily liquidity. Short-term debt instruments
classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets are not included since they are recorded at amortized cost.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Assets and Liabilities:

The nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets consist of mutual funds, which are valued using
the daily quoted NAVs that are publicly available and are the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in each fund. CMS Energy and Consumers value their nonqualified deferred compensation plan
liabilities based on the fair values of the plan assets, as they reflect what is owed to the plan participants in accordance with their investment elections. CMS Energy and Consumers report the assets
in other non-current assets and the liabilities in other non-current liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets.



DB SERP Assets:

CMS Energy and Consumers value their DB SERP assets using a market approach that incorporates quoted market prices. The DB SERP cash equivalents
consist of a
money market fund with daily liquidity. The DB SERP invests in mutual funds that hold primarily fixed-income instruments of varying maturities. In order to meet their investment objectives, the funds
hold investment-grade debt securities, and may invest a portion of their assets in high-yield securities, foreign debt, and derivative instruments. CMS Energy and Consumers value these
funds using the daily quoted NAVs that are publicly available and are the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in each fund. CMS Energy and Consumers report their DB SERP assets in other
non-current assets on their consolidated balance sheets. For additional details about DB SERP securities, see Note 7, Financial Instruments.

Derivative Instruments:

CMS Energy and Consumers value their derivative instruments using either a market approach that incorporates information from market
transactions, or an income approach that discounts future expected cash flows to a present value amount. CMS Energy values its exchange-traded derivative contracts based on Level 1 quoted
prices and values other derivatives using Level 2 inputs, including commodity forward prices and credit risk factors. CMS Energy and Consumers have classified certain derivatives as
Level 3 since the fair value measurements incorporate assumptions that cannot be observed or confirmed through market transactions.

In 2010, CMS Energy wrote down assets held for sale from their carrying amount of $11 million to their fair value of $5 million, resulting in a
loss of $6 million, which was recorded in earnings as part of discontinued operations. The fair value was determined based on the price that CMS Energy received for the sale of these assets,
which closed in January 2011. CMS Energy had no other nonrecurring fair value measurements and Consumers had no nonrecurring fair value measurements during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Notes receivable consist of EnerBank's fixed-rate installment loans. EnerBank estimates the fair value of these loans using a discounted cash flows
technique that incorporates market interest rates as well as assumptions about the remaining life of the loans and credit risk.

CMS
Energy and Consumers estimate the fair value of their long-term debt using quoted prices from market trades of the debt, if available. In the absence of quoted prices, CMS Energy and
Consumers calculate market yields and prices for the debt using a matrix method that incorporates market data for similarly rated debt. Depending on the information available, other valuation
techniques and models may be used that rely on assumptions that cannot be observed or confirmed through market transactions. CMS Energy includes the value of the conversion features in estimating the
fair value of its convertible debt, and incorporates, as appropriate, information on the market prices of CMS Energy common stock.

The
effects of third-party credit enhancements are excluded from the fair value measurements of long-term debt. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, CMS Energy's
long-term debt included $103 million principal amount that was supported by third-party credit enhancements. This entire principal amount was at Consumers.

The sales proceeds for all periods represent sales of investments that were held within the DB SERP and classified as available for sale. Realized gains and
losses on the sales were not significant for either CMS Energy or Consumers during each period. In 2011, CMS Energy and Consumers sold their DB SERP investments in state and municipal bonds, and
reinvested the proceeds in a mutual fund that holds fixed-income instruments of varying maturities.

Consumers
recognized gains of $5 million in 2012 and $4 million in 2011 from transferring shares of CMS Energy common stock to a related charitable foundation. The gains reflected the
excess
of fair value over cost of the stock donated and were included in income. Consumers did not transfer any shares of CMS Energy common stock in 2010.

EnerBank notes receivable are unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements.

The
allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance to reflect estimated credit losses. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by loan charge-offs net
of recoveries. Management estimates the allowance balance required by taking into consideration



historical
loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, economic conditions, and other factors. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the loss is confirmed, but no later
than the point at which a loan becomes 120 days past due.

Presented
in the following table are the changes in the allowance for loan losses:

Maintenance and Depreciation:

CMS Energy and Consumers record property repairs and minor property replacement as maintenance expense. CMS Energy and Consumers
record planned major maintenance activities as operating expense unless the cost represents the acquisition of additional long-lived assets or the replacement of an existing
long-lived asset.

Consumers
depreciates utility property on an asset-group basis, in which it applies a single MPSC-approved depreciation rate to the gross investment in a particular class of
property within the electric and gas segments. Consumers performs depreciation studies periodically to determine appropriate group lives. Presented in the following table are the composite
depreciation rates for Consumers' segment properties:

CMS Energy and Consumers record plant, property, and equipment at original cost when placed into service. The cost includes labor, material, applicable taxes,
overhead such as pension and other benefits, and AFUDC, if applicable. Consumers' plant, property, and equipment is generally recoverable through its general rate making process. For additional
details, see Note 3, Regulatory Matters.



When
utility property is mothballed, the property stays in rate base and continues to be depreciated at the same rate as before the mothball period. When utility property is retired or otherwise
disposed of in the ordinary course of business, Consumers records the original cost to accumulated depreciation, along with associated cost of removal, net of salvage. CMS Energy and Consumers
recognize gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of non-regulated assets in income. Consumers records cost of removal collected from customers, but not spent, as a regulatory
liability.

Consumers
capitalizes AFUDC on regulated major construction projects, except pollution control facilities on its fossil-fueled power plants. AFUDC represents the estimated cost of debt and authorized
return-on-equity funds used to finance construction additions. Consumers records the offsetting credit as a reduction of interest for the amount representing the borrowed funds
component and as other income for the equity funds component on the consolidated statements of income. When construction is completed and the property is placed in service, Consumers depreciates and
recovers the capitalized AFUDC from customers over the life of the related asset. Presented in the following table are Consumers' composite AFUDC capitalization rates:

CMS Energy and Consumers capitalize the purchase and development of internal-use computer software. These costs are expensed evenly over the
estimated useful life of the internal-use computer software. If computer software is integral to computer hardware, then its cost is capitalized and depreciated with the hardware. The
types of costs capitalized are consistent for all periods presented by the financial statements.

utility facilities in proportion to each participant's undivided ownership interest. Consumers is required to provide only its share of financing for the jointly owned utility facilities.

10:  LEASES

CMS Energy and Consumers lease various assets, including service vehicles, railcars, gas pipeline capacity, and buildings. In addition, CMS Energy and Consumers
account for a number of their PPAs as capital and operating leases.

Operating
leases for coal-carrying railcars have lease terms expiring without extension provisions over the next 11 years and with extension provisions over the next
14 years. These leases contain fair market value extension and buyout provisions, with some providing for predetermined extension period rentals. Capital leases for Consumers' vehicle fleet
operations have a maximum term of 120 months with some having end-of-lease rental adjustment clauses based on the proceeds received from the sale or disposition of the vehicles, and others
having fixed percentage purchase options.

Consumers
has capital leases for gas transportation pipelines to the Karn generating complex and Zeeland. The capital lease for the gas transportation pipeline into the Karn generating complex has a
term of 15 years with a provision to extend the contract from month to month. The remaining term of the contract was nine years at December 31, 2012. The capital lease for the gas
transportation pipeline to Zeeland, which had a term of 12 years, was extended in 2012 for five years pursuant to the renewal provision at the end of the contract. At December 31, 2012,
the remaining term of the contract was five years with a renewal provision of five years at the end of the contract. The remaining terms of Consumers' long-term PPAs accounted for as
leases range between one and 20 years. Most of these PPAs contain provisions at the end of the initial contract terms to renew the agreements annually.



Presented in the following table are Consumers' minimum lease expense and contingent rental expense. For each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, all
of CMS Energy's minimum lease expense and contingent rental expense were attributable to Consumers.

In
2007, Consumers sold Palisades to Entergy and entered into a 15-year PPA to buy all of the capacity and energy then capable of
being produced by Palisades. Consumers has continuing involvement with Palisades through security provided to Entergy for Consumers' PPA obligation and other arrangements. Because of these ongoing
arrangements, Consumers accounted for the transaction as a financing of Palisades and not a sale. Accordingly, no gain on the sale of Palisades was recognized on the consolidated statements of income.
Consumers accounted for the remaining non-real-estate assets and liabilities associated with the transaction as a sale.

Palisades remains on Consumers' consolidated balance sheets and Consumers continues to depreciate it. Consumers recorded the related proceeds as a finance
obligation with payments recorded to interest expense and the finance obligation based on the amortization of the obligation over the life of the Palisades PPA. The value of the finance obligation was
determined based on an allocation of the transaction proceeds to the fair values of the net assets sold and



fair value of the plant asset under the financing. Total amortization and interest charges under the financing were $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, $21 million
for the year ended December 31, 2011, and $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

11:  ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

CMS Energy and Consumers record the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their useful lives, if there is a legal obligation to remove them. No
market risk premiums were included in CMS Energy's and Consumers' ARO fair value estimates since reasonable estimates could not be made. If a five percent market risk premium were assumed, CMS
Energy's and Consumers' ARO liabilities at December 31, 2012 would increase by $16 million and at December 31, 2011 would increase by $13 million. In 2012, Consumers
updated the ARO for coal ash disposal areas to reflect a revised estimate of future obligations, and recorded the initial estimate for the Lake Winds® Energy Park ARO.

If
a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a reasonable estimate of
fair value can be made. CMS Energy and Consumers have not recorded liabilities for assets that have insignificant cumulative disposal costs, such as substation batteries.

Presented
below are the categories of assets that CMS Energy and Consumers have legal obligations to remove at the end of their useful lives and for which they have an ARO liability recorded:

Pension Plan:

Participants in the Pension Plan include CMS Energy's and Consumers' present employees, employees of their subsidiaries, and employees of Panhandle,
a former CMS Energy subsidiary. Pension Plan trust assets are not distinguishable by company.

CMS
Energy and Consumers provide an employer contribution of five percent of base pay to the DCCP 401(k) plan for employees hired on or after September 1, 2005. On January 1, 2011, the
employer contribution was increased to six percent. Employees are not required to contribute in order to receive the plan's employer contribution.

Participants
in the cash balance Pension Plan, effective July 1, 2003 to August 31, 2005, also participate in the DCCP as of September 1, 2005. Additional pay credits under the
cash balance Pension Plan were discontinued as of September 1, 2005. DCCP expense for CMS Energy and Consumers was $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012,
$7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, and $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

DB SERP:

The DB SERP is a non-qualified plan as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. DB SERP benefits are paid from a rabbi trust established in 1988.
DB SERP rabbi trust earnings are taxable. Presented in the following table are the fair value of trust assets, ABO, and contributions for CMS Energy's and Consumers' DB SERP:

DC SERP:

On April 1, 2006, CMS Energy and Consumers implemented a DC SERP and froze further new participation in the DB SERP. The DC SERP provides
participants benefits ranging from 5 percent to 15 percent of total compensation. The DC SERP requires a minimum of five years of participation before vesting. CMS Energy's and
Consumers' contributions to the plan, if any, are placed in a grantor trust. For CMS Energy and Consumers, trust assets were $1 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.
DC SERP assets are included in other non-current assets on CMS Energy's and Consumers' consolidated balance sheets. CMS Energy's and Consumers' DC SERP expense was less than
$1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010.

401(k):

The 401(k) plan employer match equals 60 percent of eligible contributions up to the first six percent of an employee's wages. The total 401(k) plan
cost for CMS Energy, including Consumers, was $16 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. The total 401(k) plan cost for Consumers was $16 million
for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

OPEB:

Participants in the OPEB plan include all regular full-time employees covered by the employee health care plan on the day before retirement from
either CMS Energy or Consumers at age 55 or older with at least ten full years of applicable continuous service. Regular full-time employees who qualify for Pension Plan disability
retirement and have 15 years of applicable continuous service may also participate in the OPEB plan. Retiree health care costs were based on the assumption that costs would increase
8.0 percent for those under 65 and 7.5 percent for those over 65 in 2013 and 7.5 percent in 2012 for all retirees. The rate of increase was assumed to decline to five percent for
all retirees by 2019 and thereafter.

The
assumptions used in the health care cost-trend rate affect service, interest, and PBO costs. Presented in the following table are the effects of a one-percentage-point

The
discount rate reflects the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from a
yield curve analysis. This analysis incorporated the projected benefit payments specific to CMS Energy's and Consumers' Pension Plan and OPEB plan and the yields on high quality corporate bonds rated
Aa or better.


The
mortality assumption was based on the RP-2000 mortality tables with projection of future mortality improvements using Scale AA,
which aligned with the IRS prescriptions for cash funding valuations under the Pension Protection Act of 2006.


CMS
Energy and Consumers determined the long-term rate of return using historical market returns, the present and expected future
economic environment, the capital market principles of risk and return, and the expert opinions of individuals and firms with financial market knowledge. CMS Energy and Consumers considered the asset
allocation of the portfolio in forecasting the future expected total return of the portfolio. The goal was to determine a long-term rate of return that could be incorporated into the
planning of future cash flow requirements in conjunction with the change in the liability. Annually, CMS Energy and Consumers review for reasonableness and appropriateness the forecasted returns for
various classes of assets used to construct an expected return model. CMS Energy's and Consumers' expected long-term rate of return on Pension Plan assets was 7.75 percent in 2012.
The actual return on Pension Plan assets was 14.1 percent in 2012, four percent in 2011, and 13 percent in 2010.

Regulatory
adjustments are the differences between amounts included in rates and the periodic benefit cost calculated. These regulatory
adjustments were offset by surcharge revenues, which resulted in no impact to net income for the years presented. The pension and OPEB regulatory asset was less than $1 million at
December 31, 2012 and 2011.

For CMS Energy, the estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit Pension Plans that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost in
2013 from the regulatory asset is $98 million and from AOCI is $2 million. For Consumers, the estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit Pension Plans that will be
amortized into net periodic benefit cost in 2013 from the regulatory asset is $98 million. For CMS Energy, the estimated net loss and prior service credit for the OPEB plans that will be
amortized into net periodic benefit cost in 2013 from the regulatory asset is $23 million, with a decrease from AOCI of $1 million. For Consumers, the estimated net loss and prior
service credit for the OPEB plans that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost in 2013 from the regulatory asset is $23 million.

CMS
Energy and Consumers amortize net gains and losses in excess of ten percent of the greater of the PBO or the MRV over the average remaining service period. The estimated period of amortization of
gains and losses for CMS Energy and Consumers was 11 years for pension and 13 years for OPEB for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and 12 years for pension
and 14 years for OPEB for the year ended December 31, 2010. Prior service cost amortization is established in the year in which the prior service cost first occurred, and is based on the
same amortization period for all future years until the prior service costs are fully amortized. CMS Energy and Consumers had new prior service credits for OPEB in 2010.



The
estimated period of amortization of these new prior service credits for CMS Energy and Consumers was ten years for OPEB for the year ended December 31, 2010.

At
December 31, 2012, $590 million of the total funded status of the Pension Plan was attributable to Consumers based on an
allocation of expenses. At December 31, 2011, $414 million of the funded status of the Pension Plan was attributable to Consumers based on an allocation of expenses.


CMS
Energy received payments of $5 million in each of 2012, 2011, and 2010 for the Medicare Part D subsidies. Consumers received
payments of $5 million in each of 2012, 2011, and 2010 for the Medicare Part D subsidies. The Medicare Part D subsidy payments are used to pay OPEB plan benefits.


The
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare
Part D) and a federal subsidy, which is tax-exempt, to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D.
In 2010, the Health Care Acts repealed these tax-exempt deductions for years beginning after December 31, 2012. The Medicare Part D annualized reduction in net OPEB cost for
CMS Energy was $20 million for 2012, $26 million for 2011, and $28 million for 2010. Consumers' Medicare Part D annualized reduction in net OPEB costs was
$19 million for 2012, $25 million for 2011, and $26 million for 2010. The reduction for CMS Energy and Consumers included $7 million for 2012, $9 million for 2011,
and $10 million for 2010 in capitalized OPEB costs.



At December 31, 2012, CMS Energy classified $7 million of DB SERP liabilities as current liabilities, and $627 million of Pension Plan,
$137 million of DB SERP, and $682 million of OPEB liabilities as non-current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2011, CMS Energy
classified $7 million of DB SERP liabilities as current liabilities, and $446 million of Pension Plan, $120 million of DB SERP, and $717 million of OPEB liabilities as
non-current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets.

At
December 31, 2012, Consumers classified $4 million of DB SERP liabilities as current liabilities, and $590 million of Pension Plan, $96 million of DB SERP, and
$692 million of OPEB liabilities as non-current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2011, Consumers classified $4 million of DB SERP
liabilities as current liabilities, and $414 million of Pension Plan, $81 million of DB SERP, and $724 million of OPEB liabilities as non-current liabilities on its
consolidated balance sheets.

CMS
Energy, including Consumers, plans to contribute $74 million to the OPEB plan in 2013, of which Consumers plans to contribute
$73 million.


CMS
Energy, including Consumers, planned to contribute $50 million to the Pension Plan in 2013, of which Consumers planned to contribute
$49 million. This Pension Plan contribution was made in January 2013.

Contributions include required and discretionary amounts. Actual future contributions will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates,
and various factors related to the populations participating in the plans.

In
2011, CMS Energy reached its target asset allocation for Pension Plan assets of 50 percent equity, 30 percent fixed income, and 20 percent alternative-strategy investments.
This target asset allocation is expected to continue to maximize the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function
of the liabilities of the plan. Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S&P 500 Index, with lesser allocations to the S&P MidCap and SmallCap Indexes and Foreign Equity Funds.
Fixed-income investments are diversified across investment grade instruments of government and corporate issuers as well as high-yield and global bond funds. Alternative strategies are
diversified across absolute return investment approaches and global tactical asset allocation. CMS Energy and Consumers use annual liability measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic
asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to the portfolio allocation.

CMS
Energy and Consumers established union and non-union VEBA trusts to fund their future retiree health and life insurance benefits. These trusts are funded through the ratemaking process
for Consumers and through direct contributions from the non-utility subsidiaries. In 2012, CMS Energy and Consumers adjusted their target asset allocation to 50 percent equity,
20 percent fixed income, and 30 percent alternative-strategy investments. This target allocation is expected to continue to maximize the long-term return on plan assets,
while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the liabilities of the plan. Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S&P 500 Index, with
lesser allocations to the S&P SmallCap Index
and Foreign Equity Funds. Fixed-income investments are diversified across investment grade instruments of government and corporate issuers. Alternative strategies



are

CMS
Energy's and Consumers' OPEB benefit payments are net of employee contributions and expected Medicare Part D prescription drug
subsidy payments. For CMS Energy, subsidies to be received are estimated to be $6 million for 2013, $7 million for each of 2014 and 2015, $8 million for each of 2016 and 2017, and
$51 million combined for 2018 through 2022. For Consumers, subsidies to be received are estimated to be $6 million for each of 2013 and 2014, $7 million for each of 2015 and 2016,
$8 million for 2017, and $48 million combined for 2018 through 2022.

Collective Bargaining Agreements:

At December 31, 2012, unions represented 43 percent of CMS Energy's employees and 45 percent of Consumers'
employees. The UWUA represents
Consumers' operating, maintenance, construction, and call center employees. The USW represents Zeeland employees. Union contracts expire in 2015.

13:  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

CMS Energy and Consumers provide a PISP to key employees and non-employee directors based on their contributions to the successful management of the
company. The PISP has a five-year term, expiring in May 2014.

All
grants under the PISP for 2012, 2011, and 2010 were in the form of TSR restricted stock and time-lapse restricted stock. Restricted stock recipients receive shares of CMS Energy common
stock. Restricted stock shares granted prior to August 1, 2010 have full dividend and voting rights. The TSR restricted stock shares granted after August 1, 2010 continue to have full
voting rights. In lieu of cash dividend payments, however, the TSR restricted stock shares granted after August 1, 2010 receive additional restricted shares equal to the value of the dividend.
These additional restricted shares are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying restricted stock shares.



TSR
restricted stock vesting is contingent on meeting a three-year service requirement and a specific market condition. The market condition is based entirely on a comparison of CMS
Energy's TSR with the median TSR of a peer group over the same three-year period. Depending on the outcome of the market condition, a recipient may earn a total award ranging from zero to
200 percent of the initial grant. Time-lapse restricted stock vests after a service period of three years.

Restricted
stock awards granted to officers in 2012 and 2011 were 75 percent TSR restricted stock and 25 percent time-lapse restricted stock. Awards granted to officers in
2010 were 67 percent TSR restricted stock and 33 percent time-lapse restricted stock.

For
awards granted prior to August 1, 2010, restricted shares may vest fully upon retirement, disability, or change of control of CMS Energy if certain minimum service requirements are met or
are waived by action of the C&HR Committees. If employment terminates for any other
reason (other than death) or the minimum service requirements are not met or waived, the restricted shares will be fully forfeited. For awards granted after August 1, 2010, a
pro-rata portion of the award equal to the portion of the service period served between the award grant date and the employee's termination date will vest upon termination of an employee
due to retirement, disability, or change of control of CMS Energy. For TSR awards, this vesting is contingent upon the outcome of the market condition. The remaining portion of the award will be
forfeited. All awards vest fully upon death.

The
PISP also allows for stock options, stock appreciation rights, phantom shares, performance units, and incentive options, none of which was granted in 2012, 2011, or 2010.

Shares
awarded or subject to stock options, phantom shares, or performance units may not exceed 6 million shares from June 2009 through May 2014, nor may such awards to any recipient exceed
500,000 shares in any fiscal year. CMS Energy and Consumers may issue awards of up to 2,972,977 shares of common stock under the PISP at December 31, 2012. Shares for which payment or exercise
is in cash, as well as shares or stock options forfeited for any reason other than failure to meet a market condition, may be awarded or granted again under the PISP.

During
2012, CMS Energy granted 306,917 TSR shares, 176,809 time-lapse shares, 38,401 shares from dividends paid on TSR shares, and
407,000 shares granted as a result of the outcome of the TSR awards' market condition. During 2012, Consumers granted 291,722 TSR shares, 169,754 time-lapse shares, 37,109 shares from
dividends paid on TSR shares, and 390,485 shares granted as a result of the outcome of the TSR awards' market condition.

CMS Energy and Consumers charge the fair value of the awards to expense over the required service period. As a result, for awards granted prior to
August 1, 2010, CMS Energy and Consumers recognize all compensation expense for share-based awards that have accelerated service provisions upon retirement by the period in which the employee
becomes eligible to retire. TSR restricted stock awards granted after August 1, 2010 have graded vesting features, and CMS Energy and Consumers recognize expense for those awards on a graded
vesting schedule over the required service period. Expense for time-lapse awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period. CMS Energy and
Consumers calculate the fair value of time-lapse restricted stock based on the price of CMS Energy's common stock on the grant date. CMS Energy and Consumers calculate the fair value of
TSR restricted stock awards on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. CMS Energy and Consumers base expected volatilities on the historical volatility of the price of CMS Energy common stock.

The
risk-free rate for each valuation was based on the three-year U.S. Treasury yield at the award grant date. Presented in the following table are the significant assumptions
used to estimate the fair value of the TSR restricted stock awards:

Stock options give the holder the right to purchase common stock at the market price on the grant date. Stock options are exercisable upon grant, and expire up
to ten years and one month from the grant date. CMS Energy and Consumers issue new shares when recipients exercise stock options. No stock options were exercised for CMS Energy or Consumers during
2012. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for CMS Energy and Consumers was $1 million



for
each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Neither CMS Energy nor Consumers has any stock options outstanding at December 31, 2012.

Since
CMS Energy has utilized tax loss carryforwards, CMS Energy was unable to realize excess tax benefits upon exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. Therefore, CMS Energy did not
recognize the related excess tax benefits in equity. As of December 31, 2012, CMS Energy has $49 million of unrealized excess tax benefits.

14:  INCOME TAXES

CMS Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and a unitary Michigan income tax return. Income taxes are allocated
based on each company's separate taxable income in accordance with the CMS Energy tax sharing agreement.

For
the year ended December 31, 2011, CMS Energy and Consumers remeasured their Michigan deferred income tax assets and liabilities due
to the enactment in May 2011 of the MCIT, which became effective January 1, 2012. The MCIT, a simplified six percent corporate income tax, replaced the MBT, a complex multi-part
tax. CMS Energy recognized a one-time non-cash deferred tax benefit of $32 million as a result of this remeasurement. Consumers recognized a $128 million
regulatory asset (not including the effects of income tax gross-ups) related to this change in tax law.


For
the year ended December 31, 2010, CMS Energy recognized deferred tax expense of $3 million to reflect the enactment of the
Health Care Acts. The law change prospectively repealed the tax deduction for the portion of the health care costs reimbursed by the Medicare Part D subsidy for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2012.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities
and the reported amounts on CMS Energy's and Consumers' consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current according to the
classification of the related assets or liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not related to assets or liabilities are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary
differences.

CMS Energy has provided a valuation allowance of $1 million for the local tax loss carryforward, a valuation allowance of $1 million for the state
capital loss carryforward, and a valuation allowance of $1 million for general business credits. Consumers has provided a valuation allowance of $1 million for the state capital loss
carryforward. CMS Energy and Consumers expect to utilize fully tax loss and credit carryforwards for which no valuation has been provided. It is reasonably possible that further adjustments will be
made to the valuation allowances within one year.

CMS Energy, including Consumers, had uncertain tax benefits of $1 million at December 31, 2012 and $4 million at December 31, 2011
and 2010 that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate in future years. Consumers had uncertain tax benefits of $1 million at December 31, 2012, $4 million at
December 31, 2011, and $3 million at December 31, 2010 that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate in future years.



CMS
Energy and Consumers recognize accrued interest and penalties, where applicable, as part of income tax expense. CMS Energy, including Consumers, recognized no interest for the years ended
December 31, 2012 and 2011 and less than $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. In 2010, CMS Energy settled with the IRS and, as a result, paid $6 million of
accrued interest.

In
November 2010, the IRS concluded its audit of CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, which increased taxable income by $132 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 through
December 31, 2007. Of this amount, $82 million resulted in a decrease to the existing net operating loss carryforward and the remaining $50 million increased taxable income. As a
result, CMS Energy paid $15 million in tax and accrued interest. Most of the adjustments related to the timing of deductions, not the disallowance of deductions. The tax adjustments were
allocated based on the companies' separate taxable income, in accordance with CMS Energy's tax sharing agreement. The impact to net income was less than $1 million.

In
May 2012, the IRS completed its audit of CMS Energy and its subsidiaries for 2008 and 2009, as well as its audit of research and development tax credit claims for 2001 through 2009. The audits
resulted in a $45 million increase in the net operating loss carryforward. The impact to net income as a result of the completion of the audits was a decrease of $1 million.

CMS
Energy's federal income tax returns for 2010 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the IRS. CMS Energy's MBT returns for 2008 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by
the State of Michigan.

The
amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. CMS Energy's and Consumers' estimate of
the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMS Energy and Consumers believe that their accrued tax liabilities at December 31, 2012 were adequate for all years.

WARDS

CMS Energy's non-vested stock awards are composed of participating and non-participating securities. The participating securities accrue
cash dividends when common stockholders receive dividends. Since the recipient is not required to return the dividends to CMS Energy if the recipient forfeits the award, the non-vested
stock awards are considered participating securities. As such, the participating non-vested stock awards were included in the computation of basic EPS. The non-participating
securities accrue stock dividends that vest concurrently with the stock award. If the recipient forfeits the award, the stock dividends accrued on the non-participating securities are also
forfeited. Accordingly, the non-participating awards and stock dividends were included in the computation of diluted EPS, but not basic EPS.

17:  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

Reportable segments consist of business units defined by the products and services they offer. CMS Energy and Consumers evaluate the performance of each segment
based on its contribution to net income available to CMS Energy's common stockholders. The reportable segments for CMS Energy and Consumers are:

CMS
Energy:

•

electric utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the generation and distribution of electricity in
Michigan;

•

gas utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the transportation, storage, and distribution of natural
gas in Michigan;

•

enterprises, consisting of various subsidiaries engaging primarily in domestic independent power production; and

•

other, including EnerBank, corporate interest and other expenses, and discontinued operations.

Consumers:

•

electric utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the generation and distribution of electricity in
Michigan;

•

gas utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the transportation, storage, and distribution of natural
gas in Michigan; and

•

other, including a consolidated special-purpose entity for the sale of accounts receivable.

Accounting
policies for CMS Energy's and Consumers' segments are as described in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies. The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses of the individual segments when appropriate. Accounts are allocated among the segments when common accounts are attributable to more than one segment. The allocations are based
on certain measures of business activities, such as revenue, labor dollars, customers, other operation and maintenance expense, construction expense, leased property, taxes, or functional surveys. For
example, customer receivables are allocated based on revenue, and pension provisions are allocated based on labor dollars.

Inter-segment
sales and transfers are accounted for at current market prices and are eliminated in consolidated net income available to common stockholders by segment.

had no international assets for any of the years presented.



18:  RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS – CONSUMERS

Consumers enters into a number of significant transactions with related parties. These transactions include:

•

purchase and sale of electricity from and to affiliates of CMS Enterprises;

•

payment of parent company overhead costs to CMS Energy;
and

•

investment in CMS Energy common stock.

Transactions
involving power supply purchases from certain affiliates of CMS Enterprises are based on avoided costs under PURPA, state law, and competitive bidding. The payment of parent company
overhead costs is based on the use of accepted industry allocation methodologies. These payments are for costs that occur in the normal course of business.

Consumers
owned 1.3 million shares of CMS Energy common stock with a fair value of $32 million at December 31, 2012. For additional details on Consumers' investment in CMS Energy
common stock, see Note 7, Financial Instruments.

19:  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

Variable interests are contractual, ownership, or other interests in an entity that change as the fair value of the VIE's net assets, excluding variable
interests, changes. An entity is considered to be a VIE when its capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or its equity
investors, as a group, lack the characteristics of having a controlling financial interest.

Entities
that are VIEs must be consolidated if the reporting entity determines that it has a controlling financial interest. The entity that is required to consolidate the VIE is called the primary
beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the
obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

CMS
Energy consolidates CMS Energy Trust I because CMS Energy is the variable interest holder that designed the entity and, through the design, has the power to direct the activities of CMS
Energy Trust I that most significantly impact the trust's economic performance. The sole assets of the trust consisted of subordinated notes issued by CMS Energy, and the sole liabilities of
the trust consisted of Trust Preferred Securities. CMS Energy guaranteed payment of the Trust Preferred Securities. CMS Energy redeemed all of the securities in February 2012.



CMS
Energy has variable interests in T.E.S. Filer City, Grayling, and Genesee. CMS Energy is not the primary beneficiary of any of these partnerships because power is shared among unrelated parties,
and no one party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance. The partners must agree on all major decisions for each of the partnerships.

Presented
in the following table is information about these partnerships:

Name (Ownership Interest)

Nature of the Entity

Financing of Partnership

T.E.S. Filer City (50%)

Coal-fueled power generator

Non-recourse long-term debt that matured in December 2007.

Grayling (50%)

Wood waste-fueled power generator

Sale of revenue bonds that were retired in March 2012.

Genesee (50%)

Wood waste-fueled power generator

Sale of revenue bonds that mature in 2021 and bear interest at fixed rates. The debt is non-recourse to the partnership and secured by a CMS Energy guarantee capped at $3 million annually.

CMS Energy has operating and management contracts with Grayling and Genesee, and Consumers is the primary purchaser of power from each partnership through
long-term PPAs. Consumers also has reduced dispatch agreements with Grayling and Genesee, which allow these facilities to be dispatched based on the market price of wood waste. This
results in fuel cost savings that each partnership shares with Consumers' customers.

CMS
Energy's investment in these partnerships is included in investments on its consolidated balance sheets in the amount of $56 million as of December 31, 2012 and $52 million as
of December 31, 2011. The creditors of these partnerships do not have recourse to the general credit of CMS Energy or Consumers, except through a guarantee provided by CMS Energy of
$3 million annually. CMS Energy has deferred collections on certain receivables owed by Genesee. CMS Energy's maximum exposure to loss from these receivables is $7 million. Consumers has
not provided any financial or other support during the periods presented that was not previously contractually required.

ALES

The impacts of asset sales are included in gain on asset sales, net and income (loss) from discontinued operations on CMS Energy's consolidated statements of
income. CMS Energy had no significant asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2012. Consumers had no significant asset sales during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, or
2010.

In
2010, CMS Enterprises exercised its option to sell its stock interest in CMS Generation San Nicolas Company and transferred the sale proceeds to Michigan Energy Investments LLC, a
non-affiliated company. As a result, CMS Enterprises recognized a $3 million net gain. In 2010,



CMS
Enterprises also sold a cost-method investment with a carrying value of zero, and recognized a $3 million gain.

with the 2003 sale of Panhandle.


Includes
an operating gain of $3 million related to a litigation settlement at CMS Viron.


Includes
an operating loss of $2 million ($1 million net of tax) at Exeter, whose assets and liabilities were reclassified as held
for sale in 2009.

Also
includes disposal-related losses of $10 million in additional tax expense resulting from an IRS audit adjustment related to a 2003 asset sale, a $6 million ($4 million net of
tax) loss for the write down of CMS Energy's investment in Exeter, a $5 million ($3 million net of tax) loss for the increase in a liability for a 2007 asset sale, and a
$5 million ($3 million net of tax) loss on the settlement of a 2002 asset sale indemnity.

Discontinued operations include a provision for closing costs and a portion of CMS Energy's parent company interest expense. CMS Energy allocated no interest
expense in 2012 and allocated less than $1 million of interest expense in each of 2011 and 2010. CMS Energy allocates its interest expense by applying its total interest expense to the net
carrying amount of the asset sold divided by CMS Energy's total capitalization.

CMS
Energy sold its interest in Exeter in January 2011. Major classes of assets and liabilities of Exeter classified as held for sale on CMS Energy's consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2010 were insignificant.

I

MPAIRMENT

C

HARGES

In 2010, CMS Energy wrote down its investment in Exeter from its carrying amount of $11 million to Exeter's fair value of $5 million. This
valuation was based on the price that CMS Energy received for the sale of Exeter, which closed in January 2011. The impairment resulted in a loss of $6 million, which was recorded in
earnings as part of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.

In
May 2010, Consumers announced plans to defer the development of its proposed 830-MW coal-fueled plant at its Karn/Weadock generating complex. At that time, Consumers
recorded a charge of $3 million to write off certain capitalized development costs because the costs were



deemed
not to have long-term value in connection with the potential future construction of the plant. The project's air permit, issued by the MDEQ in December 2009, was set to
expire in August 2011 if construction of the coal plant had not commenced or if Consumers had not been granted an extension of the air permit. In December 2010, Consumers determined that
it would not begin construction before August 2011 as a means of preserving the air permit. As a result, the likelihood that the plant would be constructed had diminished significantly. In
December 2010, in accordance with accounting standards governing impairment of plant costs for regulated utilities, Consumers recorded an additional charge of $19 million to write off
the remaining previously capitalized development costs associated with the proposed plant. The total charge of $22 million was recorded in other operating expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2010. In December 2011, Consumers announced the cancellation of the proposed plant.

CMS
Energy and Consumers recorded no other impairments of long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

CMS Energy Corporation

In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of cash flows, and of changes in equity present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of CMS Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on
our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

CMS E

NERGY

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its CEO and
CFO, CMS Energy conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act). Based on such evaluation, CMS Energy's CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2012.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:

CMS Energy's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). CMS Energy's internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes
policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of CMS Energy;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of CMS Energy are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of CMS Energy; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
CMS Energy's assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.

Management,
including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become
inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMS Energy conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2012. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, CMS Energy's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2012. The effectiveness of CMS Energy's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an



independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

There have been no changes in CMS Energy's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently
completed fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO THE
CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1:    BASIS OF PRESENTATION

CMS Energy's condensed financial statements have been prepared on a parent-only basis. In accordance with Rule 12-04 of
Regulation S-X, these parent-only financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for annual financial statements, and therefore
these parent-only financial statements and other information included should be read in conjunction with CMS Energy's audited consolidated financial statements contained within
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

2:    GUARANTEES

CMS Energy has issued guarantees with a maximum potential obligation of $165 million on behalf of some of its wholly owned subsidiaries. CMS Energy's
maximum potential obligation consists primarily of payment obligations to third parties under commodity purchase and swap agreements at CMS ERM and to the DOE for non-payment by Consumers
in relation to the DOE settlement. The expiry dates of these guarantees vary, depending upon contractual provisions or upon the statute of limitations under the relevant governing law.
