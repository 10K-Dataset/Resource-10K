    to provide electric utility service in 61 of the
    68 counties of Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Principal
    cities served include Battle Creek, Flint, Grand Rapids,
    Jackson, Kalamazoo, Midland, Muskegon and Saginaw.
    Consumers’ electric utility customer base comprises a mix
    of residential, commercial and diversified industrial customers,
    the largest segment of which is the automotive industry (which
    represents four percent of Consumers’ 2008 revenues).
    Consumers’ electric utility operations are not dependent
    upon a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of
    any one or even a few of these customers is not reasonably
    likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition.

Consumers’ electric utility operations are seasonal. The
    consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer
    months, primarily due to the use of air conditioners and other
    cooling equipment. In 2008, Consumers’ electric deliveries
    were 39 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of
    1.5 billion kWh. In 2007, Consumers’ electric
    deliveries were 39 billion kWh, which included ROA
    deliveries of 1.4 billion kWh.

Consumers’ 2008 summer peak demand was 7,488 MW
    excluding ROA loads and 7,705 MW including ROA loads. For
    the

2007-08

winter period, Consumers’ peak demand was 5,739 MW
    excluding ROA loads and 5,925 MW including ROA loads.
    Alternative electric suppliers were providing generation
    services to ROA customers of 332 MW at December 31,
    2008 and 315 MW at December 31, 2007. Consumers had a
    13.7 percent Reserve Margin target for summer 2008,
    which was achieved. Consumers owns or controls, through
    long-term contract, capacity necessary to supply
    96.4 percent of projected firm peak load for summer 2009
    and has purchased the remainder from others.

Consumers has four generating sites that burn coal. In 2008,
    these plants produced a combined total of 17,701 million
    kWh of electricity, which represents 95 percent of the
    energy produced by Consumers’ plants. These plants burned
    9.5 million tons of coal in 2008. On December 31,
    2008, Consumers had on hand a

40-day

supply of coal.

Consumers has entered into coal supply contracts with various
    suppliers and associated rail transportation contracts for its
    coal-based generating plants. Under the terms of these
    agreements, Consumers is obligated to take physical delivery of
    the coal and make payment based upon the contract terms.
    Consumers’ coal supply contracts expire through 2011 and
    total an estimated $478 million. Its coal transportation
    contracts expire through 2009 and total an estimated
    $163 million. Long-term coal supply contracts have
    accounted for approximately 60 to 90 percent of
    Consumers’ annual coal requirements over the last
    10 years.

At December 31, 2008, Consumers had future unrecognized
    commitments to purchase capacity and energy under long-term
    power purchase agreements with various generating plants. These
    contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the
    plants’ availability or deliverability. These payments for
    2009 through 2030 total an estimated $13.770 billion and
    average $626 million per year. This amount may vary
    depending upon plant availability and fuel costs. Consumers is
    obligated to pay capacity charges based upon the amount of
    capacity available at a given time, whether or not power is
    delivered to Consumers.



Consumers
    Gas Utility

Gas
    Utility Operations

Consumers’ gas utility operating revenue was
    $2.827 billion in 2008, $2.621 billion in 2007, and
    $2.374 billion in 2006. Consumers’ gas utility
    operations purchase, transport, store, distribute and sell
    natural gas. Consumers is authorized to provide gas utility
    service in 46 of the 68 counties in Michigan’s Lower
    Peninsula. Principal cities served include Flint, Jackson,
    Kalamazoo, Lansing, Pontiac, Saginaw, Macomb, Royal Oak, Howell,
    and Livonia, where more than 1.5 million of Consumers’
    gas customers are located. Consumers’ gas utility
    operations are not dependent upon a single customer, or even a
    few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of these
    customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse
    effect on its financial condition.

Consumers’ gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers
    injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for
    use during the winter months when the demand for natural gas is
    higher. Peak demand occurs in the winter due to colder
    temperatures and the resulting use of heating fuels. In 2008,
    deliveries of natural gas sold through Consumers’ pipeline
    and distribution network totaled 344 bcf.

Gas Utility Properties:

Consumers’ gas
    distribution and transmission system located throughout
    Michigan’s Lower Peninsula consists of:

•

26,451 miles of distribution mains;

•

1,656 miles of transmission lines;

•

7 compressor stations with a total of 159,250 installed
    horsepower; and

•

15 gas storage fields with an aggregate storage capacity of 307
    bcf and a working storage capacity of 142 bcf.

Gas Supply:

In 2008, Consumers purchased
    67 percent of the gas it delivered from United States
    producers and 23 percent from Canadian producers.
    Authorized suppliers in the gas customer choice program supplied
    the remaining 10 percent of gas that Consumers delivered.

Consumers’ firm gas transportation agreements are with ANR
    Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, L.P., Trunkline
    Gas Co., Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, and Vector
    Pipeline. Consumers uses these agreements to deliver gas to
    Michigan for ultimate deliveries to market. Consumers’ firm
    transportation and city gate arrangements are capable of
    delivering over 90 percent of Consumers’ total gas
    supply requirements. As of December 31, 2008,
    Consumers’ portfolio of firm transportation from pipelines
    to Michigan is as follows:

Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under
    incremental firm transportation contracts, firm city gate
    contracts and, as needed, interruptible transportation
    contracts. The amount of interruptible transportation service
    and its use vary primarily with the price for this service and
    the availability and price of the spot supplies being purchased
    and transported. Consumers’ use of interruptible
    transportation is generally in off-peak summer months and after
    Consumers has fully utilized the services under the firm
    transportation agreements.



Enterprises

Enterprises, through various subsidiaries and certain equity
    investments, is engaged primarily in domestic independent power
    production and the marketing of independent power production. In
    2007, Enterprises made a significant change in business strategy
    by exiting the international marketplace and refocusing its
    business strategy to concentrate on its independent power
    business in the United States.

Enterprises’ operating revenue included in Continuing
    Operations in our consolidated financial statements was
    $379 million in 2008, $383 million in 2007, and
    $438 million in 2006. Operating revenue included in
    Discontinued Operations in our consolidated financial statements
    was $235 million in 2007 and $684 million in 2006.

Independent Power
    Production

CMS Generation was formed in 1986. It invested in and operated
    non-utility power generation plants in the United States and
    abroad. In 2007, Enterprises sold CMS Generation and all of its
    international assets and power production facilities and
    transferred its domestic independent power plant operations to
    its subsidiary, HYDRA-CO. For more information on the asset
    sales, see ITEM 8. CMS ENERGY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA — NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — NOTE 3. ASSET SALES,
    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES — ASSET
    SALES.

The independent power production’s operating revenue
    included in Continuing Operations in our consolidated financial
    statements was $36 million in 2008, $41 million in
    2007, and $103 million in 2006. Operating revenue included
    in Discontinued Operations in our consolidated financial
    statements was $124 million in 2007 and $437 million
    in 2006.

Independent Power Production Properties:

At
    December 31, 2008, CMS Energy had ownership interests in
    independent power plants totaling 1,199 gross MW or
    1,078 net MW (net MW reflects that portion of the
    gross capacity in relation to CMS Energy’s ownership
    interest).

    ENERGY’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS — CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY.

Energy Resource
    Management

CMS ERM was formed in 1996. It purchases and sells energy
    commodities in support of CMS Energy’s generating
    facilities. In 2004, CMS ERM discontinued its natural gas retail
    program as customer contracts expired and changed its name from
    CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company to CMS Energy
    Resource Management Company.



In 2008, CMS ERM marketed approximately 22 bcf of natural gas
    and 1,778 GWh of electricity. Its operating revenue was
    $343 million in 2008, $342 million in 2007, and
    $334 million in 2006.

Natural Gas
    Transmission

CMS Gas Transmission was formed in 1988 and owned, developed and
    managed domestic and international natural gas facilities. In
    March 2007, CMS Gas Transmission sold a portfolio of its
    businesses in Argentina and its northern Michigan non-utility
    natural gas assets to Lucid Energy. In August 2007, CMS Gas
    Transmission sold its investment in GasAtacama to Endesa S.A. In
    June 2008, CMS Gas Transmission completed the sale of TGN in
    Argentina. For more information on these asset sales see
    ITEM 8. CMS ENERGY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
    SUPPLEMENTARY DATA — NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — NOTE 3. ASSET SALES,
    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES — ASSET
    SALES.

CMS Gas Transmission’s operating revenue included in
    Continuing Operations in our consolidated financial statements
    was less than $1 million in 2008 and 2007, and
    $1 million in 2006. Operating revenue included in
    Discontinued Operations in our consolidated financial statements
    was $3 million in 2007 and $17 million in 2006.

International
    Energy Distribution

In April 2007, CMS Energy sold its ownership interest in SENECA.
    In June 2007, CMS Energy sold CPEE. For more information on
    these asset sales, see ITEM 8. CMS ENERGY’S FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA — NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — NOTE 3. ASSET
    SALES, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND IMPAIRMENT

The international energy distribution’s operating revenue,
    all of which was reflected in Discontinued Operations in our
    consolidated financial statements was $108 million in 2007
    and $230 million in 2006.

CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS REGULATION

CMS Energy, Consumers and their subsidiaries are subject to
    regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign
    governmental agencies, including those described in the
    following sections.

Michigan Public
    Service Commission

Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which
    regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail
    utility rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities
    and other matters.

The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, and the MPSC staff
    typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers.
    The Michigan Attorney General or ABATE often appeal significant
    MPSC orders.

Rate Proceedings:

In 2008, the MPSC issued an order
    that established the electric authorized rate of return on
    common equity at 10.7 percent. During 2008, we filed an
    electric rate case with the MPSC requesting an 11 percent
    authorized rate of return, which is still pending. In February
    2008, we filed a gas rate case with the MPSC requesting an
    11 percent authorized rate of return. In December 2008, the
    MPSC approved a settlement agreement that established the gas
    authorized rate of return on common equity at 10.55 percent.

The PSCR and GCR processes allow for recovery of reasonable and
    prudent power supply and gas costs. The MPSC reviews these costs
    for reasonableness and prudency in annual plan proceedings and
    in plan reconciliation proceedings. For additional information,
    see ITEM 8. CMS ENERGY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
    SUPPLEMENTARY DATA — NOTE 4 OF CMS ENERGY’S
    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    (CONTINGENCIES) — CONSUMERS’ ELECTRIC UTILITY
    RATE MATTERS and CONSUMERS’ GAS UTILITY RATE MATTERS and
    ITEM 8. CONSUMERS’ FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
    SUPPLEMENTARY DATA — NOTE 4 OF CONSUMERS’
    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    (CONTINGENCIES) — ELECTRIC RATE MATTERS and GAS RATE
    MATTERS.



MPSC Regulation and Michigan Legislation:

In October
    2008, the Michigan governor signed into law a comprehensive
    energy reform package. Significant features of the new
    legislation include:

•

a provision to streamline the regulatory process by generally
    allowing utilities to self-implement rates six months after
    filing, subject to refund, and requiring the MPSC to issue an
    order 12 months after filing or the rates as filed become
    permanent,

•

reform of the Customer Choice Act to limit generally alternative
    energy suppliers to no more than 10 percent of our
    weather-adjusted sales,

•

establishment of a certificate-of-necessity process at the MPSC
    for existing or proposed power plants, or power purchase
    agreements if the construction, investment, or purchase costs
    more than $500 million,

•

a requirement that 10 percent of electric sales volume come
    from renewable energy sources by 2015 with interim
    targets, and

•

new programs and incentives to encourage greater energy
    efficiency among customers, along with the requirement that the
    utility prepare energy cost savings optimization plans and
    achieve sales reduction targets beginning in 2009 through 2015.

Consumers transports some of the natural gas it sells to
    customers through facilities owned by competitors including gas
    producers, marketers and others. Pursuant to a self-implemented
    gas customer choice program, all of Consumers’ gas
    customers are eligible to select an alternative gas commodity
    supplier.

Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission

The FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several
    independent power plants and exempt wholesale generators in
    which Enterprises has ownership interests, as well as over CMS
    ERM, CMS Gas Transmission, and DIG. Among other things, the FERC
    has jurisdiction over acquisitions, operation and disposal of
    certain assets and facilities, services provided and rates
    charged, conduct among affiliates, and limited jurisdiction over
    holding company matters with respect to CMS Energy. The FERC, in
    connection with the North American Electric Reliability
    Corporation and regional reliability organizations, also
    regulates generation owners and operators, load serving
    entities, purchase and sale entities and others with regard to
    reliability of the bulk power system. Some of Consumers’
    gas business is also subject to regulation by the FERC,
    including a blanket transportation tariff pursuant to which
    Consumers may transport gas in interstate commerce.

The FERC also regulates certain aspects of Consumers’
    electric operations including compliance with the FERC
    accounting rules, wholesale rates, operation of licensed
    hydro-electric generating plants, transfers of certain
    facilities, and corporate mergers and issuance of securities.

Other
    Regulation

The Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural
    gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to
    the FERC and the DOE’s Office of Fossil Fuels.

Consumers’ pipelines are subject to the Natural Gas
    Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and the Pipeline Safety Improvement
    Act of 2002, which regulate the safety of gas pipelines.

CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

CMS Energy, Consumers and their subsidiaries are subject to
    various federal, state and local regulations for environmental
    quality, including air and water quality, waste management,
    zoning and other matters.

Consumers continues to install modern emission controls at its
    electric generating plants and convert electric generating units
    to burn cleaner fuels. Consumers expects that the cost of future
    environmental compliance, especially compliance with the federal
    Clean Air Act, will be significant because of the EPA
    regulations and



proposed regulations regarding nitrogen oxides,
    particulate-related emissions, and mercury. Consumers plans to
    spend $817 million for equipment installation through 2017
    to comply with a number of these environmental regulations,
    including regulations limiting nitrogen oxides and sulfur
    dioxide emissions. The MDEQ is currently reviewing public
    comments on Michigan’s proposed mercury rule. If the
    proposed rule is enacted, Consumers expects to spend
    approximately $782 million by 2015 to comply with the rule.
    For additional information concerning estimated capital
    expenditures related to environmental compliance, including
    capital expenditures to reduce nitrogen oxides-related
    emissions, see ITEM 7. CMS ENERGY’S MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — OUTLOOK — ELECTRIC
    UTILITY BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES — ELECTRIC
    ENVIRONMENTAL ESTIMATES.

Construction, operation, and closure of a modern solid waste
    disposal area for ash can be expensive because of strict federal
    and state requirements. In order to achieve significant
    reductions in ash field closure costs, Consumers has worked with
    others to use bottom ash and fly ash as part of a temporary and
    final cover for ash disposal areas instead of native materials,
    in cases where the use of bottom ash and fly ash is compatible
    with environmental standards. To reduce disposal volumes,
    Consumers sells coal ash for use as a Portland cement
    replacement in concrete products, as a filler for asphalt, as
    feedstock for the manufacture of Portland cement and for other
    environmentally compatible uses.

The EPA has been considering the development of new federal
    standards for ash disposal areas for several years.
    Michigan’s solid waste rules that regulate coal ash
    landfills were developed in 1993 and have been updated since
    that time. All Consumers’ ash facilities have groundwater
    monitoring programs and are subject to quarterly MDEQ
    inspections. With the installation of a new dry ash handling
    system at its Karn and Weadock plants in the fourth quarter of
    2008, the vast majority of Consumers’ fly ash is collected
    dry. Consumers is working through industry groups to ensure the
    development of cost-effective rules that are consistent with
    protection of the environment.

Like most electric utilities, Consumers has PCB in some of its
    electrical equipment. During routine maintenance activities,
    Consumers identified PCB as a component in certain paint, grout
    and sealant materials at Ludington. Consumers removed and
    replaced part of the PCB material with non-PCB material. Since
    proposing a plan to deal with the remaining materials, Consumers
    has had several communications with the EPA. We are not able to
    predict when the EPA will issue a final ruling. Consumers is
    awaiting a response from the EPA.

Certain environmental regulations affecting CMS Energy and
    Consumers include, but are not limited to, the NREPA and
    Superfund. Despite some differences between the statutes, both
    NREPA and Superfund can require the sharing of remediation and
    other response costs among current site owners and operators,
    owners and operators at the time of disposal, transporters, and
    those who arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at the
    site. For additional information on Consumers’ NREPA and
    Superfund sites and information on notices of violation from the
    EPA related to alleged violations of NSR regulations at three of
    Consumers’ coal-based facilities and alleged emission
    limits violations related to fourteen of Consumers’ utility
    boilers, see ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
    DATA — NOTE 4 (CONTINGENCIES) OF CMS
    ENERGY’S NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    AND NOTE 4 OF CONSUMERS’ NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CMS Energy has recorded a significant liability for its
    obligations associated with Bay Harbor. For additional
    information, see ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
    SUPPLEMENTARY DATA — NOTE 4 (CONTINGENCIES) OF
    CMS ENERGY’S NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS and ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ current insurance program
    does not extend to cover the risks of certain environmental
    cleanup costs or environmental damages, such as claims for air
    pollution, damage to sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, and
    for some past PCB contamination, and for some long-term storage
    or disposal of pollutants.



CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS COMPETITION

Electric
    Competition

Consumers’ electric utility business experiences actual and
    potential competition from many sources, both in the wholesale
    and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric
    delivery, and retail services.

The Customer Choice Act allows all of our electric customers to
    buy electric generation service from us or from an alternative
    electric supplier. However, legislation enacted in Michigan in
    October 2008 revised the Customer Choice Act and generally
    limits alternative electric supply to 10 percent of our
    weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year.
    At December 2008, alternative electric suppliers were providing
    332 MW of generation service to ROA customers, which is
    equivalent to 4 percent of our weather-adjusted retail
    sales from the preceding calendar year.

Consumers also has competition or potential competition from:

•

industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their
    production capacity outside Consumers’ service territory
    for economic reasons;

•

municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery
    systems;

•

customer self-generation; and

•

adjacent utilities that extend lines to customers in contiguous
    service territories.

Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in
    adjacent areas and enforcing compliance with the MPSC and the
    FERC rules, providing non-energy services, and providing
    tariff-based incentives that support economic development.

Consumers offers non-energy revenue-producing services to
    electric customers, municipalities and other utilities in an
    effort to offset costs. These services include engineering and
    consulting, construction of customer-owned distribution
    facilities, sales of equipment (such as transformers), power
    quality analysis, energy management services, meter reading, and
    joint construction for phone and cable. In these activities,
    Consumers faces competition from many sources, including energy
    management services companies, other utilities, contractors, and
    retail merchandisers.

CMS ERM, a non-utility electric subsidiary, continues to focus
    on optimizing CMS Energy’s independent power production
    portfolio. CMS Energy’s independent power production
    business, a non-utility electric subsidiary, faces competition
    from generators, marketers and brokers, as well as other
    utilities marketing power in the wholesale market.

Gas
    Competition

Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas
    utility business, and is likely to increase. Competition comes
    from other gas suppliers taking advantage of direct access to
    Consumers’ customers and from alternative fuels and energy
    sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.

INSURANCE

CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain
    insurance coverage similar to comparable companies in the same
    lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms,
    conditions, limitations and exclusions that might not fully
    compensate CMS Energy for all losses. A portion of each loss is
    generally assumed by CMS Energy in the form of deductibles and
    self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As
    CMS Energy renews its policies it is possible that some of the
    current insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on
    commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance
    markets.

ITEM 1A. RISK
    FACTORS

Actual results in future periods for CMS Energy and Consumers
    could differ materially from historical results and the
    forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors
    that might cause or contribute to these differences include, but
    are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections.
    The companies’ business is influenced by many factors that
    are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may
    materially affect actual results and are often beyond the
    companies’ control. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known or that the companies’ management currently
    believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the
    companies. The risk factors described in the following sections,
    as well as the other information included in this annual report
    and in the other documents filed with the SEC, should be
    considered carefully before making an investment in securities
    of CMS Energy and Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also
    risk factors of CMS Energy.

CMS
    Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its
    debt service obligations.

Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on
    dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service
    obligations. Restrictions contained in Consumers’ preferred
    stock provisions and other legal restrictions, such as certain
    terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements,
    limit Consumers’ ability to pay dividends or acquire its
    own stock from CMS Energy. At December 31, 2008, Consumers
    had $331 million of unrestricted retained earnings
    available to pay common stock dividends. If sufficient dividends
    are not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy may
    not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its cash
    obligations, thereby adversely affecting its liquidity and
    financial condition.

CMS
    Energy has substantial indebtedness that could limit its
    financial flexibility and hence its ability to meet its debt
    service obligations.

As of December 31, 2008, CMS Energy had $1.881 billion
    aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, including
    $178 million of subordinated indebtedness relating to its
    convertible preferred securities. Subsidiary debt of
    $4.549 billion is not included in the preceding total. As
    of December 31, 2008, there were $105 million of
    borrowings and $24 million of letters of credit outstanding
    under CMS Energy’s revolving credit agreement. CMS Energy
    and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the
    future.

The level of CMS Energy’s present and future indebtedness
    could have several important effects on its future operations,
    including, among others:

•

a significant portion of its cash flow from operations will be
    dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its
    indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes;

•

covenants contained in its existing debt arrangements require it
    to meet certain financial tests, which may affect its
    flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its
    business;

•

its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital,
    capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and
    other purposes may be limited;

•

it may be at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that
    are less leveraged;

•

its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions
    may increase; and

•

its future credit ratings.

CMS Energy’s ability to meet its debt service obligations
    and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future
    performance, which will be subject to general economic
    conditions, industry cycles, regulatory decisions and financial,
    business and other factors affecting its operations, many of
    which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances
    that its business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow
    from operations to service its indebtedness. If it is unable to
    generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it may be
    required to sell additional assets or obtain additional
    financing. CMS Energy cannot assure that additional financing
    will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.



CMS
    Energy cannot predict the outcome of claims regarding its
    participation in the development of Bay Harbor.

As part of the development of Bay Harbor by certain subsidiaries
    of CMS Energy, pursuant to an agreement with the MDEQ, third
    parties constructed a golf course and park over several
    abandoned CKD piles, left over from the former cement plant
    operations on the Bay Harbor site. The third parties also
    undertook a series of remedial actions, including removing
    abandoned buildings and equipment; consolidating, shaping and
    covering CKD piles with soil and vegetation; removing CKD from
    streams and beaches; and constructing a leachate collection
    system at an identified seep. Leachate is formed when water
    passes through CKD. In 2002, CMS Energy sold its interest in Bay
    Harbor, but retained its obligations under environmental
    indemnifications entered into at the start of the project.

In 2005, the EPA along with CMS Land and CMS Capital voluntarily
    executed an AOC under Superfund and approved a Removal Action
    Work Plan to address issues at Bay Harbor. Collection systems
    required under the plan have been installed and shoreline
    monitoring is ongoing. In February 2008, CMS Land and CMS
    Capital submitted a proposed augmentation plan to the EPA to
    address areas where pH measurements are not satisfactory. CMS
    Land, CMS Capital and the EPA have agreed upon the augmentation
    measures and a schedule for their installation. The augmentation
    measures are being implemented and are anticipated to be
    completed in 2009.

In February 2008, the MDEQ and the EPA granted permits for CMS
    Land or its affiliate, Beeland, to construct and operate a deep
    injection well near Alba, Michigan in eastern Antrim County.
    Certain environmental groups, a local township, and a local
    county filed an appeal of the EPA’s decision and, following
    denial by the MDEQ of a right to a hearing, filed lawsuits in
    the Ingham Circuit Court appealing the permits. The EPA has
    denied the appeal. One appeal relating to the state permit
    remains pending in the state court. Groups opposed to the
    injection well filed a lawsuit in Antrim County seeking an
    injunction against development of the well. In January 2009, the
    trial judge issued a preliminary injunction. Beeland is
    considering an appeal of the court’s order.

CMS Land and CMS Capital, the MDEQ, the EPA, and other parties
    are having ongoing discussions concerning the long-term remedy
    for the Bay Harbor sites. These discussions are addressing,
    among other things, issues relating to:

•

the disposal of leachate,

•

the capping and excavation of CKD,

•

the location and design of collection lines and upstream
    diversion of water,

•

potential flow of leachate below the collection system,

•

applicable criteria for various substances such as
    mercury, and

•

other matters that are likely to affect the scope of remedial
    work that CMS Land and CMS Capital may be obligated to undertake.

CMS Energy has recorded a cumulative charge of
    $141 million, which includes accretion expense, for its
    obligations. Depending on the size of any indemnification
    obligation or liability under environmental laws, an adverse
    outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on
    CMS Energy’s liquidity and financial condition and could
    negatively impact CMS Energy’s financial results. CMS
    Energy cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this
    matter.

CMS
    Energy may be adversely affected by regulatory investigations
    and civil lawsuits regarding pricing information that CMS MST
    and CMS Field Services provided to market
    publications.

CMS Energy notified appropriate regulatory and governmental
    agencies that some employees at CMS MST and CMS Field Services
    appeared to have provided inaccurate information regarding
    natural gas trades to various energy industry publications which
    compile and report index prices. CMS Energy is cooperating with
    an ongoing investigation by the DOJ regarding this matter. CMS
    Energy is unable to predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation
    and what effect, if any, the investigation will have on CMS
    Energy.



CMS Energy, CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas,
    Inc. (the company that purchased CMS Field Services) and Cantera
    Gas Company were named as defendants in various lawsuits arising
    as a result of alleged false natural gas price reporting.
    Allegations included manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures
    and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies and artificial
    inflation of natural gas retail prices in California, Colorado,
    Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee and Wisconsin. CMS Energy cannot
    predict the outcome of the lawsuits. It is possible that the
    outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could affect adversely
    CMS Energy’s liquidity, financial condition and results of
    operations.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers retain contingent liabilities in connection
    with their asset sales.

The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the
    sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are
    required to:

•

retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes,
    pensions or environmental conditions;

•

indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the
    inaccuracy of representations and warranties they make; and

•

make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of
    post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits or other reviews.

Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for
    extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending
    on the extent to which the buyers may ultimately seek to enforce
    their rights under these contractual provisions, and the
    resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a
    material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers have financing needs and may be unable to
    obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. If the
    national and worldwide financial crisis intensifies, potential
    disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely
    affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses,
    including the availability and cost of short-term funds for
    liquidity requirements and their ability to meet long-term
    commitments; each could adversely affect their liquidity,
    financial condition and results of operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands
    pursuant to commercial commitments, under guarantees,
    indemnities and letters of credit. Consumers’ capital
    requirements are expected to be substantial over the next
    several years as it implements generation and environmental
    projects.

CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets,
    particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking
    and commercial paper markets, to meet their financial
    commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are
    not available from CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    respective operations. CMS Energy and Consumers also use letters
    of credit issued under each of their revolving credit facilities
    to support certain operations and investments. Disruptions in
    the capital and credit markets, as have been experienced during
    2008, and continuing in 2009, could adversely affect CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ ability to draw on their
    respective bank revolving credit facilities. CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ access to funds under those credit
    facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are
    parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments.
    Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to
    CMS Energy and Consumers if they experience shortages of capital
    and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of
    borrowing requests from CMS Energy and Consumers and other
    borrowers within a short period of time.

Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a
    result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced
    alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions
    could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    access to liquidity needed for their respective businesses. Any
    disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take
    measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until
    alternative credit arrangements or other funding for their
    business needs can be arranged. These measures could include
    deferring capital expenditures, changing CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ commodity purchasing strategy to avoid
    collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating
    future share repurchases, dividend payments or other
    discretionary uses of cash.



CMS Energy continues to explore financing opportunities to
    supplement its financial plan. These potential opportunities
    include refinancing

and/or

issuing new capital markets debt, preferred stock

and/or

common equity, and bank financing. CMS Energy cannot guarantee
    the capital markets’ acceptance of its securities or
    predict the impact of factors beyond its control, such as
    actions of rating agencies. If CMS Energy is unable to obtain
    bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or
    refinance indebtedness, there could be a material adverse effect
    on its liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
    Similarly, Consumers currently plans to seek funds through the
    capital markets, commercial lenders and leasing arrangements.
    Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital
    market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and
    to Consumers’ securities issuances in particular. Consumers
    cannot guarantee the capital markets’ acceptance of its
    securities or predict the impact of factors beyond its control,
    such as actions of rating agencies. If Consumers is unable to
    obtain bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or
    refinance indebtedness, there could be a material adverse effect
    on its liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain of CMS Energy’s securities and those of its
    affiliates, including Consumers, are rated by various credit
    rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of
    its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS
    Energy’s or Consumers’ ability to access capital on
    acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit and
    could make its cost of borrowing higher. If it is unable to
    maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers may
    have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain of its
    suppliers pursuant to existing contracts with them. Further, any
    adverse developments to Consumers, which provides dividends to
    CMS Energy, that result in a lowering of Consumers’ credit
    ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy’s credit
    ratings. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of
    their current ratings will remain in effect for any given period
    of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
    entirely by a rating agency.

Electric
    industry regulation could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ business, including their ability to recover
    costs from their customers.

Federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed
    dramatically in the last two decades and could continue to
    change over the next several years. These changes could have a
    material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by,
    extensive federal and state utility regulation. In CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ business planning and
    management of operations, they must address the effects of
    existing and proposed regulation on their businesses and changes
    in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by federal
    and state legislatures, regional transmission organizations,
    utility regulators and taxing authorities. Adoption of new
    regulations by federal or state agencies, or changes to current
    regulations and interpretations of these regulations may
    adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

There are multiple proceedings pending before the FERC involving
    transmission rates, regional transmission organizations and
    electric bulk power markets and transmission. The FERC reviewed
    the standards under which electric utilities are allowed to
    participate in wholesale power markets without price
    restrictions. In June 2007, the FERC issued a final rule on
    these standards that did not impact negatively Consumers’
    ability to retain its market-based rate authority. The
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has been
    petitioned to review portions of this final rule. CMS Energy and
    Consumers cannot predict the impact of these electric industry
    restructuring proceedings on their liquidity, financial
    condition or results of operations.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers could incur significant costs to comply
    with environmental standards and face difficulty in recovering
    these costs on a current basis.

CMS Energy, Consumers and their subsidiaries are subject to
    costly and increasingly stringent environmental regulations.
    They expect that the cost of future environmental compliance,
    especially compliance with clean air and water laws, will be
    significant. Federal rules governing coal-based electric
    generating plant emission controls for nitrogen oxides, sulfur
    dioxide and mercury are being reviewed by the courts.

The U.S. Supreme Court, in Massachusetts v. EPA, has
    remanded a claim to the EPA to consider whether greenhouse gases
    should be regulated as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. The
    EPA is reviewing the matter. There



are also pending regulatory and judicial actions which seek to
    have either existing or new coal-based power plants be subject
    to greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act. In
    addition, legislative proposals have been before the
    U.S. Congress pertaining to the potential regulation or
    control of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases.
    These or similar proposals are considered likely to be enacted
    in some form and could have a significant impact upon the
    operation and cost of existing and planned future coal-based
    power plants.

In 2008, Consumers obtained 52 percent of its energy from
    purchased and interchange power and 48 percent of its
    energy from Consumers-owned generation. Of the amount of energy
    obtained from Consumers-owned generation, 95 percent came
    from coal-based power plants. The electric energy from its coal,
    gas and oil-based power plants would be subject to carbon
    dioxide emissions regulations. In 2008, it is estimated that
    carbon dioxide emissions from Consumers-owned coal-based power
    plants, excluding the portion of jointly-owned Campbell Unit 3,
    exceeded approximately 19 million tons of carbon dioxide.
    Enterprises also has interests in coal-based power plants and
    other types of power plants that produce carbon emissions. These
    plants would also be subject to carbon dioxide emissions
    regulations. These proposals, if enacted, could require the
    purchase of allowances for, or taxation of, carbon emissions,
    could require the curtailment of use of coal-based power plants,
    or could require the use of other alternatives to fossil-fuel
    based generating capacity

and/or

otherwise could significantly affect Consumers’ and
    Enterprises operations and plans for, and costs associated with
    their fossil-fuel generating plants and purchased power.

There are ongoing state-level and Midwest regional greenhouse
    gas regulatory initiatives. The State of Michigan has convened
    the Michigan Climate Action Council, a climate change
    stakeholder process. Michigan is also a signatory participant in
    the Midwest Governors Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord process.
    The governor of Michigan recently proposed a 45 percent
    reduction in the use of fossil fuel for electric generation by
    2020. The governor’s office has subsequently advised us
    that the 45 percent is only a suggested target, and is
    intended to apply only to coal-based generation. She also issued
    an executive directive requiring the MDEQ to determine whether
    an electric generation need exists that would be served by a
    proposed coal-based power plant; and if such need exists, to
    consider reasonable and prudent alternatives to coal before
    issuing an air permit for the proposed coal-based power plant.
    The Michigan attorney general issued an opinion that invalidated
    the governor’s directive on the basis that the
    governor’s directive exceeded the governor’s
    authority. If the attorney general’s action is challenged
    and the directive is ultimately upheld, it will have a
    significant impact upon the operation and cost of existing and
    planned future coal-based power plants.

Other laws, proposals, rules and judicial interpretations of
    presently existing laws that govern areas such as electric
    generating plant cooling water intake systems and electric
    generating plant modifications could have a significant impact
    upon their generating plants. The EPA is currently contesting
    the applicability of NSR standards to certain of Consumers’
    coal-based plant projects, which if the EPA’s position is
    sustained, could lead to costly environmental upgrades, monetary
    sanctions, or both. If these measures or similar state measures
    are enacted or become effective, CMS Energy and Consumers could
    be required to replace equipment, install additional equipment,
    restructure or shut down operations at various facilities.

CMS Energy and Consumers expect to collect fully from their
    customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred
    to comply with environmental regulations. However, if these
    expenditures are not recovered from customers in Consumers’
    rates, CMS Energy

and/or

Consumers may be required to seek significant additional
    financing to fund these expenditures. This action could strain
    their cash resources. We can give no assurances that CMS Energy

and/or

Consumers will have access to bank financing or capital markets
    to fund these environmental expenditures.

Market
    performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit
    plan assets, which then could require significant
    funding.

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of
    assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations
    under CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ pension and
    postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have
    significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets
    in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations
    and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ forecasted return rates. A
    decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the
    level of interest rates used to



measure the required minimum funding levels may increase the
    funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in
    demographics, including increased number of retirements or
    changes in life expectancy assumptions, may increase the funding
    requirements of the obligations related to the pension and
    postretirement benefit plans. If CMS Energy and Consumers are
    unable to successfully manage their pension and postretirement
    plan assets, it could affect negatively their liquidity,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Periodic
    reviews of the values of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    assets could result in accounting charges.

CMS Energy and Consumers are required by GAAP to review
    periodically the carrying value of their assets, including those
    that may be sold. Market conditions, the operational
    characteristics of their assets and other factors could result
    in recording additional impairment charges for their assets,
    which could have an adverse effect on their stockholders’
    equity and their access to additional financing. In addition,
    CMS Energy and Consumers may be required to record impairment
    charges at the time they sell assets, depending on the sale
    prices they are able to secure and other factors.

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ revenues and results of
    operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control,
    including but not limited to future terrorist attacks or related
    acts of war.

The cost of repairing damage to CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ facilities due to storms, natural disasters,
    wars, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events, in excess of
    insurance recoveries and reserves established for these repairs,
    may affect adversely their liquidity, financial condition and
    results of operations. The occurrence or risk of occurrence of
    future terrorist activity and the high cost or potential
    unavailability of insurance to cover this terrorist activity may
    affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of
    operations in unpredictable ways. These actions could also
    result in disruptions of power and fuel markets. Instability in
    the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war or natural
    disasters, credit crises, recessions or other factors may
    adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

Energy
    risk management strategies may not be effective in managing fuel
    and electricity pricing risks, which could result in
    unanticipated liabilities to Consumers and CMS Energy or
    increased volatility of its earnings.

Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural
    gas, coal, electricity and emission credits. Prices for natural
    gas, coal, electricity and emission credits may fluctuate
    substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose
    Consumers to commodity price risk. A substantial portion of
    Consumers’ operating expenses for its plants consists of
    the costs of obtaining these commodities. Consumers manages
    these risks using established policies and procedures, and it
    may use various contracts to manage these risks, including
    swaps, options, futures and forward contracts. No assurance can
    be made that these strategies will be successful in managing
    Consumers’ pricing risk or that they will not result in net
    liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in
    these markets.

Natural gas prices in particular have historically been
    volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate
    exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather and
    changes in commodity prices associated with its gas distribution
    business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the
    GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover
    prudently incurred costs associated with those positions.
    However, Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of
    its operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the
    ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends
    on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the
    commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers may not be able to
    execute its risk management strategies, which could result in
    greater unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To
    the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity
    prices can improve or worsen CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition and results of
    operations.

In addition, Consumers included in its

2009-10

GCR
    filing a proposal to extend the GCR forward purchase period by
    two years beyond the typical three-year period, through the

2013-14

GCR
    period. These potential additional gas purchases could have a
    significant impact on Consumers’ credit requirements and
    could result in significant margin calls if prices were to fall
    below the forward purchase prices of gas purchased.



Changes
    in taxation as well as inherent difficulty in quantifying
    potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively
    impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of
    operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments
    regarding the potential tax effects of various financial
    transactions and results of operations in order to estimate
    their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations
    include income, real estate, sales and use taxes,
    employment-related taxes and ongoing issues related to these tax
    matters. The judgments include reserves for potential adverse
    outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that may
    be subject to challenge by the IRS

and/or

other
    taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues
    related to these reserves at CMS Energy or Consumers could
    adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Consumers
    is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in
    its service territories.

Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are impacted
    by the economic conditions of the customers it serves. In its
    service territories in Michigan, the economy has been hampered
    by the continued downturn and financial uncertainty in the
    automotive industry. Michigan’s economy has also been
    impacted negatively by the uncertainty in the financial and
    credit markets resulting from the subprime mortgage crisis. In
    the event economic conditions in Michigan or the region continue
    to decline, Consumers may experience reduced demand for
    electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased
    earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in its
    service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable,
    liquidity and financial condition.

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ energy sales and operations
    are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions
    from year to year.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses are generally
    seasonal. Demand for electricity is greater in the summer and
    winter months associated with cooling and heating, and demand
    for natural gas peaks in the winter heating season. Accordingly,
    their overall results in the future may fluctuate substantially
    on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling
    season and winter heating season will adversely affect CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition
    and results of operations.

Unplanned
    power plant outages may be costly for Consumers.

Unforeseen maintenance may be required to produce electricity.
    As a result of unforeseen maintenance, Consumers may be required
    to incur unplanned expenses and to make spot market purchases of
    electricity that exceed its costs of generation. Its liquidity,
    financial condition and results of operations may be adversely
    affected if it is unable to recover those increased costs.

Failure
    to succeed in implementing new processes and information systems
    could interrupt our operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers depend on numerous information systems
    for operations and financial information and billings. They
    completed recently a multi-year company-wide initiative to
    improve existing processes and implement new core information
    systems. Failure to implement successfully new processes and new
    core information systems could interrupt their operations.

Consumers
    may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal, which
    could limit its ability to operate its facilities.

Consumers is dependent on coal for much of its electric
    generating capacity. While Consumers has coal supply and
    transportation contracts in place, there can be no assurance
    that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their
    obligations to supply coal to Consumers. The suppliers under the
    agreements may experience financial or operational problems that
    inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers.
    In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be
    required to supply coal to Consumers under certain
    circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If it
    is unable to obtain its coal requirements under existing or
    future coal supply and transportation contracts, Consumers may
    be required to purchase coal at higher prices, or it may be
    forced to make additional MWh purchases through other
    potentially higher cost generating resources in the Midwest
    Energy Market. Higher coal costs increase its working capital
    requirements.



CMS
    Energy and Consumers are subject to rate
    regulation.

CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation.
    Electric and gas rates for their utilities are set by the MPSC
    and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. The
    FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell
    electricity at market-based rates. CMS Energy and Consumers may
    be impacted negatively by new regulations or interpretations by
    the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. Failure of CMS
    Energy and Consumers to obtain adequate rates or regulatory
    approvals in a timely manner may adversely affect CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations. New legislation,
    regulations or interpretations could change how the business of
    CMS Energy and Consumers operates, impact the ability of CMS
    Energy and Consumers to recover costs through rate increases or
    require CMS Energy and Consumers to incur additional expenses.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of those with
    whom they do business.

CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of
    counterparties with whom they do business. Adverse economic
    conditions affecting, or the financial difficulties of,
    counterparties with whom they do business could impair the
    ability of these counterparties to pay for CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ services or fulfill their contractual
    obligations, including performance

and/or

payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these
    counterparties to remit payments and perform services on a
    timely basis. Any delay or default in payment

and/or

performance of contractual obligations could adversely affect
    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition and results of operations. The capital and credit
    markets have been experiencing levels of volatility and
    disruption unprecedented in recent years. Market disruption and
    volatility could have a negative impact on CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ lenders, suppliers and other counterparties or
    Consumers’ customers, causing them to fail to meet their
    obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a
    negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMS Energy’s
    banking subsidiary, EnerBank.

CMS
    Energy could be required to pay cash to certain security holders
    in connection with the optional conversion of their convertible
    securities.

CMS Energy has issued three series of cash-convertible
    securities, of which an aggregate principal amount (or par value
    in the case of preferred stock) of approximately
    $677 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2008.
    If the trading price of CMS Energy’s common stock exceeds
    specified amounts at the end of a particular fiscal quarter,
    then holders of one or more series of these convertible
    securities will have the option to convert their securities in
    the following fiscal quarter, with the principal amount (or par
    value) payable in cash by CMS Energy. Accordingly, if these
    trading price minimums are satisfied and security holders
    exercise their conversion rights, CMS Energy may be required to
    outlay a significant amount of cash to those security holders,
    which could adversely affect CMS Energy’s liquidity and
    financial condition.

Consumers
    has a significant capital investment program planned for the
    next five years.

Consumers’ planned investments include a new coal-based
    power generation plant, an advanced metering infrastructure
    program, renewable power generation, gas compression, and other
    electric and gas infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems. The
    success of these investments depends on or could be affected by
    a variety of factors including, but not limited to, effective
    cost and schedule management during implementation, changes in
    commodity and other prices, operational performance, changes in
    environmental, legislative and regulatory requirements and
    regulatory cost recovery. Consumers cannot predict the impact
    that any of these factors may have on the success of its capital
    investment program. It is possible that adverse events reflected
    in these factors could adversely affect Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

GAS INDEX PRICE
    REPORTING LITIGATION

Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc. filed a putative class action lawsuit in
    the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
    California in November 2003 against a number of energy companies
    engaged in the sale of natural gas in the United States
    (including CMS Energy). The complaint alleged defendants entered
    into a price-fixing scheme by engaging in activities to
    manipulate the price of natural gas in California. The complaint
    alleged violations of the federal Sherman Act, the California
    Cartwright Act, and the California Business and Professions Code
    relating to unlawful, unfair and deceptive business practices.
    The complaint sought both actual and exemplary damages for
    alleged overcharges, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief
    regulating defendants’ future conduct relating to pricing
    and price reporting. In April 2004, a Nevada MDL panel ordered
    the transfer of the Texas-Ohio case to a pending MDL matter in
    the Nevada federal district court that at the time involved
    seven complaints originally filed in various state courts in
    California that made similar allegations. The court granted the
    defendants’ motion to dismiss on the basis of the
    “filed rate doctrine” and entered a judgment in favor
    of the defendants on April 11, 2005. Texas-Ohio appealed
    the dismissal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

While that appeal was pending, CMS Energy agreed to settle the
    Texas-Ohio case and three other cases originally filed in
    California federal courts (Fairhaven, Abelman Art Glass and
    Utility Savings), for a total payment of $700,000. On
    September 10, 2007, the court entered an order granting
    final approval of the settlement and dismissing the CMS Energy
    defendants from these cases. On September 26, 2007, the
    Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case to
    the federal district court. While CMS Energy is no longer a
    party to the Texas-Ohio case, the Ninth Circuit Court of
    Appeals’ ruling may affect the positions of CMS Energy
    entities in other pending cases, as it did in the Leggett case
    discussed in a following paragraph.

Commencing in or about February 2004, 15 state law
    complaints containing allegations similar to those made in the
    Texas-Ohio case, but generally limited to the California
    Cartwright Act and unjust enrichment, were filed in various
    California state courts against many of the same defendants
    named in the federal price manipulation cases discussed in the
    preceding paragraphs. In addition to CMS Energy, CMS MST is
    named in all 15 state law complaints. Cantera Gas Company
    and Cantera Natural Gas, LLC (erroneously sued as Cantera
    Natural Gas, Inc.) are named in all but one complaint. In
    February 2005, these 15 separate actions, as well as nine other
    similar actions that were filed in California state court but do
    not name CMS Energy or any of its former or current
    subsidiaries, were ordered coordinated with pending coordinated
    proceedings in the San Diego Superior Court. The
    24 state court complaints involving price reporting were
    coordinated as Natural Gas Antitrust Cases V. Plaintiffs in
    Natural



Gas Antitrust Cases V were ordered to file a consolidated
    complaint, but a consolidated complaint was filed only for the
    two putative class action lawsuits. Pursuant to a ruling dated
    August 23, 2006, CMS Energy, Cantera Gas Company and
    Cantera Natural Gas, LLC were dismissed as defendants in the
    master class action and the 13 non-class actions, due to lack of
    personal jurisdiction. In September 2006, CMS MST reached an
    agreement in principle to settle the master class action for
    $7 million. In March 2007, CMS Energy paid $7 million
    into a trust fund account following preliminary approval of the
    settlement by the judge. On June 12, 2007, the court
    entered a judgment, final order and decree granting final
    approval to the class action settlement with CMS MST. Certain of
    the individual cases filed in the California State Court remain
    pending against CMS MST.

Samuel D. Leggett, et al. v. Duke Energy Corporation, et al., a
    class action complaint brought on behalf of retail and business
    purchasers of natural gas in Tennessee, was filed in the
    Chancery Court of Fayette County, Tennessee in January 2005. The
    complaint contains claims for violations of the Tennessee Trade
    Practices Act based upon allegations of false reporting of price
    information by defendants to publications that compile and
    publish indices of natural gas prices for various natural gas
    hubs. The complaint seeks statutory full consideration damages
    and attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief regulating
    defendants’ future conduct. The defendants include CMS
    Energy, CMS MST and CMS Field Services. On February 2,
    2007, the state court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss
    the complaint. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on
    April 4, 2007. Oral arguments were heard on
    November 8, 2007. On October 29, 2008, the appellate
    court reversed the trial court and remanded the case for further
    proceedings, finding that the trial court had mis-applied the
    filed rate doctrine. The CMS defendants have filed an
    applications for leave to appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court
    which stays further proceedings in the trial court until the
    Supreme Court rules on the application.

J.P. Morgan Trust Company, in its capacity as Trustee of
    the FLI Liquidating Trust, filed an action in Kansas state court
    in August 2005 against a number of energy companies, including
    CMS Energy, CMS MST and CMS Field Services. The complaint
    alleges various claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act
    relating to reporting false natural gas trade information to
    publications that report trade information. Plaintiff is seeking
    statutory full consideration damages for its purchases of
    natural gas between January 1, 2000 and December 31,
    2001. The case was removed to the United States District Court
    for the District of Kansas on September 8, 2005 and
    transferred to the MDL proceeding on October 13, 2005. CMS
    Energy filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal
    jurisdiction, which was initially granted on December 18,
    2006. The court later reversed its ruling on reconsideration and
    allowed plaintiffs personal jurisdiction discovery. On
    September 7, 2007, CMS MST and CMS Field Services filed an
    answer to the complaint. CMS Energy has renewed its motion to
    dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and is awaiting the
    court’s decision. On September 26, 2008, defendants
    filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that
    the claims are barred by implied antitrust immunity arising from
    the Commodity Exchange Act. Plaintiffs have filed a motion for
    class certification to which defendants’ response is due on
    March 16, 2009.

On November 20, 2005, CMS MST was served with a summons and
    complaint which named CMS Energy, CMS MST and CMS Field Services
    as defendants in a putative class action filed in Kansas state
    court, Learjet, Inc., et al. v. Oneok, Inc., et al. Similar
    to the other actions that have been filed, the complaint alleges
    that during the putative class period, January 1, 2000
    through October 31, 2002, defendants engaged in a scheme to
    violate the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act by knowingly reporting
    false or inaccurate information to the publications, thereby
    affecting the market price of natural gas. Plaintiffs, who
    allege they purchased natural gas from defendants and others for
    their facilities, are seeking statutory full consideration
    damages consisting of the full consideration paid by plaintiffs
    for natural gas. On December 7, 2005, the case was removed
    to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas
    and later transferred to the MDL proceeding. On
    September 7, 2007, CMS MST and CMS Field Services filed an
    answer to the complaint. CMS Energy has a pending motion to
    dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and is awaiting the
    court’s decision. On September 26, 2008, defendants
    filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that
    the claims are barred by implied antitrust immunity arising from
    the Commodity Exchange Act. Plaintiffs filed their motion for
    class certification on October 17, 2008. On
    October 27, 2008, Defendants filed a second motion for
    judgment on the pleadings on statute of limitations grounds.
    Defendants’ response to the class certification motion is
    due on March 16, 2009.

Breckenridge Brewery of Colorado, LLC and BBD Acquisition
    Co. v. Oneok, Inc., et al., a class action complaint
    brought on behalf of retail direct purchasers of natural gas in
    Colorado, was filed in Colorado state court in May 2006.
    Defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS Field Services, and CMS
    MST, are alleged to have violated



the Colorado Antitrust Act of 1992 in connection with their
    natural gas price reporting activities. Plaintiffs are seeking
    full refund damages. The case was removed to the United States
    District Court for the District of Colorado on June 12,
    2006, and later transferred to the MDL proceeding. CMS Energy
    filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,
    which was initially granted. The court later reversed its ruling
    on reconsideration and allowed plaintiffs personal jurisdiction
    discovery. CMS Energy has re-filed its personal jurisdiction
    motion and is awaiting the court’s decision. The remaining
    CMS Energy defendants filed a summary judgment motion which the
    court granted in March 2008 on the basis that the named
    plaintiffs made no natural gas purchases from any named
    defendant. Plaintiffs requested reconsideration and the court
    ordered further briefing which was done. On January 8,
    2009, the judge denied plaintiffs’ motion for
    reconsideration, thereby dismissing CMS MST and CMS Field
    Services. On September 26, 2008, defendants filed a motion
    for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the claims are
    barred by implied antitrust immunity arising from the Commodity
    Exchange Act. Plaintiffs filed their motion for class
    certification on October 17, 2008. On February 23,
    2009, the court granted CMS Energy’s motion to dismiss for
    lack of jurisdiction. The January 8, 2009 ruling also
    renders moot the defendants’ motion for judgment on the
    pleadings filed in September 2008 and the plaintiffs’
    motion for class certification. An appeal of the dismissal is
    expected.

On October 30, 2006, CMS Energy and CMS MST were each
    served with a summons and complaint which named CMS Energy, CMS
    MST and CMS Field Services as defendants in an action filed in
    Missouri state court, titled Missouri Public Service
    Commission v. Oneok, Inc. The Missouri Public Service
    Commission purportedly is acting as an assignee of six local
    distribution companies, and it alleges that from at least
    January 2000 through at least October 2002, defendants knowingly
    reported false natural gas prices to publications that compile
    and publish indices of natural gas prices, and engaged in wash
    sales. The complaint contains claims for violation of the
    Missouri antitrust law, fraud and unjust enrichment. Defendants
    removed the case to Missouri federal court and then transferred
    it to the Nevada MDL proceeding. On October 30, 2007, the
    court granted the plaintiff’s motion to remand the case to
    state court in Missouri. CMS Energy filed a motion to dismiss
    for lack of personal jurisdiction, and in November 2008,
    plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed CMS Energy as a party to this
    case. Defendants, including CMS MST and CMS Field Services,
    filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing. On
    January 13, 2009, the state court judge in Kansas City,
    Missouri entered an order finding that the plaintiff Missouri
    Public Service Commission lacks standing to sue and the case was
    dismissed as to all defendants. All other pending motions were
    overruled as moot. An appeal of the dismissal is expected.

A class action complaint, Heartland Regional Medical Center, et
    al. v. Oneok Inc. et al., was filed in Missouri state court
    in March 2007 alleging violations of Missouri antitrust laws.
    Defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS Field Services, and CMS
    MST, are alleged to have violated the Missouri AntiTrust Law in
    connection with their natural gas price reporting activities.
    The action was removed to Missouri federal court, and later
    transferred to the MDL proceeding. Plaintiffs filed a motion to
    remand the case back to state court but later withdrew that
    motion and filed an amended complaint. CMS Energy filed a motion
    to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. CMS MST and CMS
    Field Services filed answers to the amended complaint. On
    September 26, 2008, defendants filed a motion for judgment
    on the pleadings on the ground that the claims are barred by
    implied antitrust immunity arising from the Commodity Exchange
    Act. Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification on
    October 17, 2008. Defendants’ response to the class
    certification motion is due on March 16, 2009.

A class action complaint, Arandell Corp., et al. v. XCEL
    Energy Inc., et al., was filed on or about December 15,
    2006 in Wisconsin state court on behalf of Wisconsin commercial
    entities that purchased natural gas between January 1, 2000
    and October 31, 2002. Defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS
    ERM and Cantera Gas Company, LLC, are alleged to have violated
    Wisconsin’s Anti-Trust statute by conspiring to manipulate
    natural gas prices. Plaintiffs are seeking full consideration
    damages, plus exemplary damages in an amount equal to three
    times the actual damages, and attorneys’ fees. The action
    was removed to Wisconsin federal district court and later
    transferred to the MDL proceeding. All of the CMS Energy
    defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal
    jurisdiction, which has been fully briefed. The court has not
    yet ruled on the motion. On September 26, 2008, defendants
    filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that
    the claims are barred by implied antitrust immunity arising from
    the Commodity Exchange Act. Plaintiffs filed their motion for
    class certification on October 17, 2008. Defendants’
    response to the class certification motion is due on
    March 16, 2009.



CMS Energy and the other CMS Energy defendants will defend
    themselves vigorously against these matters but cannot predict
    their outcome.

QUICKSILVER
    RESOURCES, INC.

On November 1, 2001, Quicksilver sued CMS MST in Texas
    state court in Fort Worth, Texas for breach of contract in
    connection with a base contract for the sale and purchase of
    natural gas. The contract outlines Quicksilver’s agreement
    to sell, and CMS MST’s agreement to buy, natural gas.
    Quicksilver believes that it is entitled to more payments for
    natural gas than it has received. CMS MST disagrees with
    Quicksilver’s analysis and believes that it has paid all
    amounts owed for delivery of gas according to the contract.
    Quicksilver sought damages of up to approximately
    $126 million, plus prejudgment interest and attorney fees.

The jury verdict awarded Quicksilver no compensatory damages but
    $10 million in punitive damages. The jury found that CMS
    MST breached the contract and committed fraud but found no
    actual damage related to such a claim.

On May 15, 2007, the trial court vacated the jury award of
    punitive damages but held that the contract should be rescinded
    prospectively. The judicial rescission of the contract caused
    CMS Energy to record a charge in the second quarter of 2007 of
    $24 million, net of tax. To preserve its appellate rights,
    CMS MST filed a motion to modify, correct or reform the judgment
    and a motion for a judgment contrary to the jury verdict with
    the trial court. The trial court dismissed these motions. CMS
    MST has filed a notice of appeal with the Texas Court of
    Appeals. Quicksilver has filed a notice of cross appeal. Both
    Quicksilver and CMS MST have filed their opening briefs and
    briefs of cross appeal. Oral arguments were made on
    October 29, 2008. Quicksilver claims that the contract
    should be rescinded from its inception, rather than merely from
    the date of the judgment. Although CMS Energy believes
    Quicksilver’s position to be without merit, if the court
    were to grant the relief requested by Quicksilver, it could
    result in a loss of up to $10 million.

STATE STREET
    BANK/TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY LITIGATION

In 1998, CMS Viron installed a number of energy savings measures
    at Texas Southern University. CMS Viron sold the master lease
    for the project to Academic Capital which transferred its
    interest to State Street Bank. Although the university accepted
    the improvements, it refused to pay on the technicality that the
    Texas Board of Higher Education had not approved the
    expenditure. In 2002, State Street Bank sued CMS Viron in the
    District Court of Harris County, Texas because state law made it
    difficult to sue the university. Presently, the plaintiffs are
    seeking approximately $6 million from CMS Viron. CMS Viron
    believes it has a valid defense to the claim, but cannot predict
    the outcome of this litigation.

MARATHON
    INDEMNITY CLAIM REGARDING F.T. BARR CLAIM

On December 3, 2001, F. T. Barr, an individual with an
    overriding royalty interest in production from the Alba field,
    filed a lawsuit in Harris County District Court in Texas against
    CMS Energy, CMS Oil and Gas and other defendants alleging that
    his overriding royalty payments related to Alba field production
    were improperly calculated. CMS Oil and Gas believes that Barr
    was properly paid on gas sales and that he was not entitled to
    the additional overriding royalty payment sought. All parties
    signed a confidential settlement agreement on April 26,
    2004. The settlement resolved claims between Barr and the
    defendants, and the involved CMS Energy entities reserved all
    defenses to any indemnity claim relating to the settlement.
    Issues exist between Marathon and certain current or former CMS
    Energy entities as to the existence and scope of any indemnity
    obligations to Marathon in connection with the settlement.
    Between April 2005 and April 2008, there were no further
    communications between Marathon and CMS Energy entities
    regarding this matter. In April 2008, Marathon indicated its
    intent to pursue the indemnity claim. Present and former CMS
    Energy entities and Marathon entered into an agreement tolling
    the statute of limitations on any claim by Marathon under the
    indemnity. CMS Energy entities dispute Marathon’s claim,
    and will vigorously oppose it if raised in any legal proceeding.
    CMS Energy entities also will assert that Marathon has suffered
    minimal, if any, damages. CMS Energy cannot predict the outcome
    of this matter. If Marathon’s claim were sustained, it
    would have a material effect on CMS Energy’s future
    earnings and cash flow.



FERC
    INVESTIGATION

On February 11, 2008, the FERC issued a data request to
    Consumers in conjunction with an investigation being conducted
    into possible violations of the FERC’s posting and
    competitive bidding regulations regarding releases of firm
    capacity on interstate natural gas pipelines. The request asked
    Consumers to provide documents relating to capacity releases by
    Consumers, among other things. The FERC is presently
    investigating certain parties with regard to a practice known as
    “flipping,” which involves the release, at below the
    maximum tariff rate, of capacity on a short term basis to a
    party followed by a release of the same capacity to an affiliate
    of the original recipient of the released capacity in the
    subsequent month. In other cases, the FERC has taken the
    position that this practice violates the FERC’s regulations
    that require posting and competitive bidding of some capacity
    releases. Consumers has provided responses to the questions
    posed in the February 11, 2008 data request. In June 2008,
    Consumers received a second set of data requests from the FERC.
    Consumers has provided responses to the questions posed in the
    June 2008 request as well as to several telephonic

follow-up

data requests. Consumers is fully cooperating with the FERC
    staff.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

The EPA has alleged that some utilities have incorrectly
    classified major plant modifications as RMRR rather than seeking
    permits from the EPA to modify their plants. Consumers responded
    to information requests from the EPA on this subject in 2000,
    2002 and 2006. Consumers believes that it has properly
    interpreted the requirements of RMRR. In October 2008, Consumers
    received another information request from the EPA under
    Section 114 of the Clean Air Act. Consumers responded to
    this information request in December 2008.

In addition to the EPA’s information request, in October
    2008, Consumers received a NOV for three of its coal-based
    facilities relating to violations of NSR regulations, alleging
    ten projects from 1986 to 1998 were subject to NSR review.
    Consumers met with the EPA in January 2009 and has additional
    meetings scheduled. If the EPA does not accept Consumers’
    interpretation of RMRR, Consumers could be required to install
    additional pollution control equipment at some or all of its
    coal-based electric generating plants, surrender emission
    allowances, engage in supplemental environmental programs or pay
    fines. Additionally, Consumers would need to assess the
    viability of continuing operations at certain plants. Consumers
    cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.

CMS Energy and Consumers, as well as their subsidiaries and
    affiliates, are subject to various other federal, state and
    local laws and regulations relating to the environment. Several
    of these companies have been named parties to other
    administrative or judicial proceedings involving environmental
    issues. Based on their present knowledge and subject to future
    legal and factual developments, they believe it is unlikely that
    any of these other actions will have a material adverse effect
    on their financial condition or future results of operations.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis

This MD&A is a consolidated report of CMS Energy. The terms
    “we” and “our” as used in this report refer
    to CMS Energy and its subsidiaries as a consolidated entity,
    except where it is clear that such term means only CMS Energy.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION

This

Form 10-K

and other written and oral statements that we make contain
    forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities
    Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our intention with the use of
    words such as “may,” “could,”
    “anticipates,” “believes,”
    “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,”
    “plans,” and other similar words is to identify
    forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. We
    designed this discussion of potential risks and uncertainties to
    highlight important factors that may impact our business and
    financial outlook. We have no obligation to update or revise
    forward-looking statements regardless of whether new
    information, future events, or any other factors affect the
    information contained in the statements. These forward-looking
    statements are subject to various factors that could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated
    in these statements. These factors include our inability to
    predict or control:

•

the price of CMS Energy Common Stock, capital and financial
    market conditions and the effect of these market conditions on
    our postretirement benefit plans, interest rates, and access to

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

CMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan.
    We are the parent holding company of several subsidiaries,
    including Consumers and Enterprises. Consumers is a combination
    electric and gas utility company serving Michigan’s Lower
    Peninsula. Enterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity
    investments, is engaged in primarily domestic independent power
    production. We manage our businesses by the nature of services
    each provides and operate principally in three business
    segments: electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises.

We earn our revenue and generate cash from operations by
    providing electric and natural gas utility services, electric
    power generation, gas distribution, transmission, and storage,
    and other energy-related services. Our businesses are affected
    primarily by:

•

weather, especially during the normal heating and cooling
    seasons,

•

economic conditions, primarily in Michigan,

•

regulation and regulatory issues that affect our electric and
    gas utility operations,

•

energy commodity prices,

•

interest rates, and

•

our debt credit ratings.

During the past several years, our business strategy has
    emphasized improving our consolidated balance sheet and
    maintaining focus on our core strength: utility operations and
    service.

Our forecast calls for investing in excess of $6 billion in
    the utility over the period from 2009 through 2013, with a key
    aspect of our strategy being our Balanced Energy Initiative. Our
    Balanced Energy Initiative is a comprehensive energy resource
    plan to meet our projected short-term and long-term electric
    power requirements

CMS-5


with energy efficiency, demand management, expanded use of
    renewable energy, development of new power plants, and pursuit
    of additional power purchase agreements to complement existing
    generating sources.

In October 2008, the Michigan governor signed into law a
    comprehensive energy reform package. In February 2009, we filed
    our renewable energy plan and energy optimization plan with the
    MPSC in order to conform to various aspects of this legislation.

As we work to implement plans to serve our customers in the
    future, the cost of energy and related cash flow issues continue
    to challenge us. Natural gas prices and eastern coal prices have
    been volatile. These costs are recoverable from our utility
    customers; however, as prices increase, the amount we pay for
    these commodities will require additional liquidity due to the
    lag in cost recoveries. There is additional uncertainty
    associated with state and federal legislative and regulatory
    proposals related to regulation of carbon dioxide emissions,
    particularly associated with coal-based generation. We are
    closely monitoring these developments for the effect on our
    future plans.

We are developing an advanced metering infrastructure system
    that will provide enhanced controls and information about our
    customer energy usage and notification of service interruptions.
    We expect to develop integration software and pilot this new
    technology over the next two to three years.

In the future, we will focus our strategy on:

•

continuing investment in our utility business,

•

growing earnings while controlling operating and fuel costs and
    parent debt,

•

managing cash flow, and

•

maintaining principles of safe, efficient operations, customer
    value, fair and timely regulation, and consistent financial
    performance.

As we execute our strategy, we will need to overcome a Michigan
    economy that has been adversely impacted by the continued
    downturn and uncertainty in Michigan’s automotive industry.
    There also has been a sharp economic downturn, uncertainty, and
    extreme volatility in the financial and credit markets resulting
    from the subprime mortgage crisis, bank failures and
    consolidation, and other market weaknesses. While we believe
    that our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our
    requirements, we continue to monitor closely developments in the
    financial and credit markets and government response to those
    developments for potential implications for our business.

In 2008, net income was $289 million compared with a net
    loss of $227 million for 2007. Combined net income from our
    electric and gas utility segments increased, compared with 2007,
    reflecting the positive impact of the MPSC rate orders and the
    elimination of certain costs from the power purchase agreement
    with the MCV

CMS-6


Partnership, partially offset by lower electric deliveries and
    increased depreciation expense. Further increasing net income
    was the absence of activities associated with assets sold in
    2007, the absence of costs associated with the termination of
    contracts in 2007, and a reduction in corporate interest expense.

Specific changes to net earnings (loss) available to common
    stockholders for 2008 versus 2007 are:

In Millions

•

absence of costs incurred by CMS ERM due to
    the termination of certain electricity sales agreements and the
    rescission of a contract with Quicksilver,

$


•

absence of impairment charges related to
    international businesses sold in 2007,


•

increase in net earnings at our electric and
    gas utility segments primarily due to favorable MPSC rate orders,


•

absence of a net loss on the disposal of
    discontinued operations in 2007,


•

other net increase at Enterprises and
    corporate and other primarily due to reduced interest and
    operating and maintenance expense, and the absence of early debt
    retirement premiums paid in 2007,

For 2007, our net loss was $227 million compared with a net
    loss of $90 million for 2006. The increase in net loss was
    due primarily to the termination of contracts at CMS ERM.
    Further increasing the net loss were charges related to the exit
    from our international businesses, the absence of earnings from
    these businesses, and an increase in the provision for Bay
    Harbor environmental remediation costs. The increase in losses
    was partially offset by the absence of the shareholder
    settlement liability recorded in 2006, the absence of activities
    related to our former interest in the MCV Partnership, and
    increased earnings at our utility primarily due to the positive
    effects of rate orders and increased sales.

Electric deliveries and rate increase:

For 2008,
    electric delivery revenues increased $89 million versus
    2007 primarily due to additional revenue of $168 million
    from the inclusion of the Zeeland power plant in rates and from
    the June 2008 rate order. The increase was partially offset by
    decreased electric revenue of $79 million primarily due to
    lower deliveries. Deliveries to end-use customers were
    37.5 billion kWh, a decrease of 1.3 billion kWh or
    3 percent versus 2007. Approximately 45 percent of the
    decrease in electric deliveries was due to weather.

For 2007, electric delivery revenues decreased $118 million
    versus 2006. The decrease was primarily due to $136 million
    of revenue related to Palisades that was designated toward the
    recovery of PSCR costs consistent with the MPSC order related to
    the sale in April 2007. Partially offsetting the decrease were
    increased electric delivery revenues of $14 million, as
    deliveries to end-use customers were 38.8 billion kWh, an
    increase of 0.3 billion kWh or 0.8 percent versus
    2006. The increase in electric deliveries was primarily due to
    favorable weather. Also contributing to the increase was
    $2 million of additional revenue from the inclusion of the
    Zeeland power plant in rates and $2 million related to the
    return of additional former ROA customers.

Surcharge revenue:

For 2008, surcharge revenue
    increased $15 million versus 2007. The increase was
    primarily due to the April 2008 MPSC order allowing recovery of
    pension and OPEB benefits through a surcharge. Consistent with
    the recovery of these costs, we recognized a similar amount of
    benefit expense. For additional details, see “Depreciation
    and other operating expenses” within this section and
    Note 8, Retirement Benefits.

For 2007, surcharge revenue increased $6 million versus
    2006. The increase was primarily due to a surcharge that we
    began collecting in the first quarter of 2006 that the MPSC
    authorized under Section 10d(4) of the Customer Choice Act.

Power supply costs and related revenue:

For 2008,
    PSCR revenue increased by $18 million versus 2007. The
    increase primarily reflects the absence of a 2007 reduction to
    revenue made in response to the MPSC’s position that PSCR
    discounts given to our Transitional Primary Rate customers could
    not be recovered under the PSCR mechanism.

For 2007, PSCR revenue decreased by $17 million versus
    2006. This decrease primarily reflects amounts excluded from
    recovery in the 2006 PSCR reconciliation case. The decrease also
    reflects the absence, in 2007, of an increase in power supply
    revenue associated with the 2005 PSCR reconciliation case.

Non-commodity revenue:

For 2008, non-commodity
    revenue decreased $14 million versus 2007 primarily due to
    the absence, in 2008, of METC transmission services revenue. The
    METC transmission service agreement expired in April 2007.

For 2007, non-commodity revenue decreased $12 million
    versus 2006 primarily due to lower METC transmission services
    revenue.

Depreciation and other operating expenses:

For 2008,
    depreciation and other operating expenses decreased
    $40 million versus 2007. The decrease was primarily due to
    the absence of operating expenses of Palisades, which

CMS-9


was sold in April 2007, and certain costs that are no longer
    incurred under our power purchase agreement with the MCV
    Partnership. Also contributing to the decrease in expenses was
    the April 2008 MPSC order allowing us to retain a portion of the
    proceeds from the 2006 sale of certain sulfur dioxide
    allowances. The decrease was partially offset by higher pension
    and OPEB expense due to the April 2008 MPSC order allowing
    recovery of certain costs through a surcharge, increased
    depreciation and amortization expense due to more plant in
    service and increased amortization of certain regulatory assets.
    For additional details on our power purchase agreement with the
    MCV Partnership, see Note 4, Contingencies, “Other
    Consumers’ Electric Utility Contingencies.”

For 2007, depreciation and other operating expenses decreased
    $150 million versus 2006. The decrease was primarily due to
    lower operating expenses of Palisades, which was sold in April
    2007. Also contributing to the decrease was the absence, in
    2007, of costs incurred in 2006 related to a refueling outage at
    Palisades, and lower overhead line maintenance and storm
    restoration costs. These decreases were offset partially by
    increased depreciation and amortization expense due to more
    plant in service and increased amortization of certain
    regulatory assets.

Other income:

For 2008, other income decreased
    $46 million versus 2007. The decrease was primarily due to
    reduced interest income, reflecting lower levels of short-term
    cash investments, and the MPSC’s June 2008 order, which did
    not allow us to recover all of our costs associated with the
    sale of Palisades. Also contributing to the decrease was a
    charge that recognized an other-than-temporary decline in the
    fair value of our SERP investments.

For 2007, other income increased $26 million versus 2006
    primarily due to higher interest income on short-term cash
    investments. The increase in short-term cash investments was
    primarily due to proceeds from the Palisades sale and equity
    infusions into Consumers.

General taxes:

For 2008, general tax expense
    decreased $15 million versus 2007 primarily due to the
    absence, in 2008, of MSBT, which was replaced with the Michigan
    Business Tax effective January 1, 2008. The Michigan
    Business Tax is an income tax. The decrease was partially offset
    by higher property tax expense.

For 2007, general tax expense increased $15 million versus
    2006 primarily due to higher property tax expense, reflecting
    higher millage rates and lower property tax refunds versus 2006.

Interest charges:

For 2008, interest charges
    decreased $11 million versus 2007 primarily due to lower
    interest associated with amounts to be refunded to our customers
    as a result of the sale of Palisades. The MPSC order approving
    the Palisades power purchase agreement with Entergy directed us
    to record interest on the unrefunded balances. Also contributing
    to the decrease was the absence, in 2008, of interest charges
    related to an IRS settlement.

For 2007, interest charges increased $18 million versus
    2006. The increase was primarily due to interest on amounts to
    be refunded to customers as a result of the sale of Palisades as
    ordered by the MPSC and interest charges related to the IRS
    settlement.

Income taxes:

For 2008, income taxes increased
    $53 million versus 2007. The increase primarily reflects
    $47 million due to higher earnings and $6 million due
    to the inclusion of the Michigan Business Tax.

For 2007, income taxes increased $5 million versus 2006
    primarily due to the absence, in 2007, of a $4 million
    income tax benefit from the restoration and utilization of
    income tax credits resulting from the resolution of an IRS
    income tax audit.

Gas deliveries and rate increase:

For 2008, gas
    delivery revenues increased $44 million versus 2007
    primarily due to additional revenue of $33 million from the
    MPSC’s August 2007 and December 2008 gas rate orders. Also
    contributing to the increase was higher gas delivery revenue of
    $11 million. Gas deliveries, including miscellaneous
    transportation to end-use customers, were 304 bcf, an increase
    of 4 bcf or 1.3 percent. The increase in gas deliveries was
    due to colder weather in 2008.

For 2007, gas delivery revenues increased $91 million
    versus 2006 primarily due to additional revenue of
    $81 million from the MPSC’s November 2006 and August
    2007 gas rate orders. Gas delivery revenues also increased
    $10 million as gas deliveries, including miscellaneous
    transportation to end-use customers, were 300 bcf, an increase
    of 18 bcf or 6.4 percent. The increase in gas deliveries
    was primarily due to colder weather, partially offset by higher
    system losses.

Gas wholesale and retail services, other gas revenues, and
    other income:

For 2008, gas wholesale and retail
    services, other gas revenues, and other income decreased
    $28 million versus 2007. The decrease was primarily due to
    lower interest income reflecting lower short-term investments,
    and lower pipeline capacity optimization revenue. Also
    contributing to the decrease was a charge that recognized an
    other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of our SERP
    investments.

For 2007, gas wholesale and retail services, other gas revenues,
    and other income increased $14 million versus 2006. The
    increase was primarily due to higher interest income on
    short-term cash investments. The increase in short-term cash
    investments was primarily due to proceeds from the Palisades
    sale and equity infusions into Consumers.

Other operating expenses:

For 2008, other operating
    expenses increased $24 million versus 2007 primarily due to
    higher uncollectible accounts expense and higher operating
    expense across our storage, transmission and distribution
    systems.

For 2007, other operating expenses increased $19 million
    versus 2006 primarily due to higher uncollectible accounts
    expense and payments, beginning in November 2006, to a fund that
    provides energy assistance to low-income customers.

General taxes and depreciation:

For 2008, general
    taxes and depreciation increased $1 million versus 2007.
    The increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and
    increased property taxes. The increase was partially offset by
    decreased general taxes due to the absence, in 2008, of MSBT,
    which was replaced by the Michigan Business Tax effective
    January 1, 2008. The Michigan Business Tax is an income tax.

For 2007, general taxes and depreciation increased
    $11 million versus 2006. The increase in general taxes
    reflects higher property tax expense due to higher millage rates
    and lower property tax refunds versus 2006. The increase in
    depreciation expense is primarily due to higher plant in service.

Interest charges:

For 2008, interest charges
    decreased $9 million versus 2007 primarily due to lower
    average debt levels and a lower average interest rate.

For 2007, interest charges decreased $4 million versus 2006
    primarily due to lower average debt levels and a lower average
    interest rate versus 2006.

Income taxes:

For 2008, income taxes decreased
    $2 million versus 2007. The decrease reflects
    $4 million related to the tax treatment of items related to
    property, plant and equipment, as required by the MPSC orders.
    This decrease was partially offset by a $1 million increase
    due to the inclusion of the Michigan Business Tax and
    $1 million related to the forfeiture of restricted stock.

For 2007, income taxes increased $29 million versus 2006
    primarily due to higher earnings by the gas utility.

CMS ERM:

Net income in 2008 increased
    $242 million versus 2007. The increase is due to the
    absence of $217 million of costs incurred for the
    termination of certain electricity sales agreements and the
    rescission of a contract with Quicksilver recorded in 2007 and
    $33 million in net operating efficiencies from the absence
    of certain sales and supply contracts, offset partially by an
    $8 million net decrease in mark-to-market activity.

Net loss in 2007 increased by $144 million as
    $217 million of costs incurred for the termination of
    certain electricity sales agreements and the rescission of a
    contract with Quicksilver more than offset a $58 million
    net increase in mark-to-market gains, a $7 million
    reduction in fuel costs, and a $8 million net reduction in
    other expenses.

Activities associated with sale of international
    assets:

These activities increased net income in 2008
    by $164 million versus 2007 as the absences of
    $122 million of net impairment charges, $46 million of
    tax expense on deferred earnings, and $29 million of
    operating and maintenance expense recorded in 2007 more than
    offset the absence of the combined $33 million of net
    earnings and gains on the sale of these assets recorded in 2007.
    For additional information, see Note 3, Asset Sales,
    Discontinued Operations and Impairment Charges.

These activities increased net loss by $58 million in 2007
    versus 2006. Taxes related to these assets increased net loss by
    $79 million as $46 million of tax expense on the
    recognition of previously deferred earnings recorded in 2007
    replaced a benefit from the resolution of an IRS income tax
    audit recorded in 2006. Further increasing net loss was a
    $31 million net reduction in equity earnings from these
    businesses. The decreases were partially offset by a
    $19 million net decrease in impairment charges, a
    $14 million net gain on the sale of these assets, and a
    $19 million reduction in interest and other expenses. For
    additional information, see Note 3, Asset Sales,
    Discontinued Operations and Impairment Charges.

Environmental remediation:

Our environmental
    remediation charges relate to our projections of future costs
    associated with Bay Harbor. These charges, net of tax, were
    $29 million in 2007 and $6 million in 2006. For
    additional information, see Note 4, Contingencies.

CMS-12


DIG:

Net income decreased $7 million in 2008
    versus 2007. The decrease is due to $5 million of higher
    maintenance costs and a $2 million reduction in steam sales.

Net loss increased $22 million in 2007 versus 2006. The
    increase is primarily due to the absences of a $13 million
    favorable arbitration settlement and $11 million of
    third-party tolling revenue recorded in 2006 partly offset by a
    $2 million reduction in interest costs.

Other:

Net decrease of $2 million in 2008
    versus 2007 primarily due to a $9 million change in the
    valuation of our SERP investments as the $5 million gain on
    re-balancing recorded in 2007 was replaced by $4 million of
    expense for the other-than-temporary decline in the value of
    these investments recorded in 2008. The impact of the SERP
    investment activity more than offset $3 million of reduced
    interest expense and a $4 million reduction in other net
    expenses.

Net increase of $2 million in 2007 versus 2006 primarily
    due to a $5 million gain on the re-balancing of our SERP
    investments. This gain was offset partially by a $3 million
    net increase in other expenses.

MCV:

We sold our interest in the MCV Partnership in
    November 2006. In 2006, our share of the MCV Partnership’s
    loss was $60 million, net of tax and minority interest.
    This was due primarily to mark-to-market losses and the net
    impact of the sale transaction, including asset impairment
    charges. These losses were partially offset by operating income
    and a property tax refund received in 2006.

For 2008, corporate interest and other net expenses were
    $85 million, an increase of $76 million versus 2007.
    The increase of $76 million primarily reflects the absence,
    in 2008, of the one-time recognition of certain tax benefits
    related to the sale of our international operations and reduced
    interest income. Partially offsetting the increase was the
    absence, in 2008, of the reduction in fair value of notes
    receivable from GasAtacama and premiums paid on the early
    retirement of CMS Energy debt in June 2007 and reduced interest
    expense due to lower debt levels in 2008.

For 2007, corporate interest and other net expenses were
    $9 million, a decrease of $144 million versus 2006.
    The $144 million decrease primarily reflects the absence,
    in 2007, of a charge for the settlement of our shareholder class
    action lawsuits partially offset by the absence of an insurance
    reimbursement received in June 2006. Also contributing to the
    decrease was the reduction in tax expense in 2007 related to the
    sale of our international operations. Partially offsetting the
    decrease was the absence, in 2007, of a tax benefit due to the
    resolution of an IRS income tax audit.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

For 2008, there was no net income from discontinued operations.
    The $89 million net loss from discontinued operations in
    2007 represents the net loss on the disposal of international
    businesses sold in 2007.

For 2007, the net loss from discontinued operations was
    $89 million versus $54 million of net income in 2006.
    The net loss on the disposal of international businesses in 2007
    replaced earnings recorded for these businesses in 2006.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following accounting policies and related information are
    important to an understanding of our results of operations and
    financial condition and should be considered an integral part of
    our MD&A. For additional accounting policies, see
    Note 1, Corporate Structure and Accounting Policies.

CMS-13


Use
    of Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we use
    estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and
    disclosures. We use accounting estimates for asset valuations,
    depreciation, amortization, financial and derivative
    instruments, employee benefits, indemnifications and
    contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimated results
    due to changes in the regulatory environment, competition,
    foreign exchange, regulatory decisions, lawsuits, and other
    factors.

Contingencies:

We record a liability for
    contingencies when we conclude that it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors in making
    these assessments.

Fair Value Measurements:

We have assets and
    liabilities that we account for or disclose at fair value. Our
    fair value measurements are performed in accordance with
    SFAS No. 157, which requires the incorporation of all
    assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
    asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
    Development of these assumptions requires significant judgment.

The most material of our fair value measurements are of our SERP
    assets, our derivative instruments, and the year-end measurement
    of our pension and OPEB plan assets. For a detailed discussion
    of the methods used to calculate our fair value measurements,
    see Note 2, Fair Value Measurements.

Income Taxes:

The amount of income taxes we pay is
    subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and foreign tax
    authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. Our
    estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is
    highly judgmental. We believe we have provided adequately for
    these exposures; however, our future results may include
    favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax
    liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved
    or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire.
    Additionally, our judgment as to our ability to recover our
    deferred tax assets may change. We believe our valuation
    allowances related to our deferred tax assets are adequate, but
    future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments.
    As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly
    over time.

Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments:

Our
    assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets and equity
    method investments involves critical accounting estimates. We
    periodically perform tests of impairment if certain triggering
    events occur or if there has been a decline in value that may be
    other than temporary. Of our total assets, recorded at
    $14.901 billion at December 31, 2008, 62 percent
    represent long-lived assets and equity method investments that
    are subject to this type of analysis. We base our evaluations of
    impairment on such indicators as:

•

the nature of the assets,

•

projected future economic benefits,

•

regulatory and political environments,

•

historical and future cash flow and profitability measurements,
    and

•

other external market conditions and factors.

The estimates we use can change over time, which could have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For
    additional details, see Note 1, Corporate Structure and
    Accounting Policies — “Impairment of Long-Lived
    Assets and Equity Method Investments.”

Accounting
    for the Effects of Industry Regulation

Consumers’ involvement in a regulated industry requires us
    to use SFAS No. 71 to account for the effects of the
    regulators’ decisions that impact the timing and
    recognition of its revenues and expenses. As a result, Consumers
    may defer or recognize revenues and expenses differently than a
    non-regulated entity.

For example, Consumers may record as regulatory assets items
    that a non-regulated entity normally would expense if the
    actions of the regulator indicate that Consumers will recover
    the expenses in future rates. Conversely, Consumers may record
    as regulatory liabilities items that non-regulated entities may
    normally recognize as

CMS-14


revenues, if the actions of the regulator indicate that it will
    be required to refund the revenues to customers. Judgment is
    required to determine the appropriate accounting for items
    recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. At
    December 31, 2008, Consumers had $2.438 billion
    recorded as regulatory assets and $1.988 billion recorded
    as regulatory liabilities.

Our PSCR and GCR cost recovery mechanisms also give rise to
    probable future revenues that will be recovered from customers
    or past overrecoveries that will be refunded to customers
    through the ratemaking process. Underrecoveries are included in
    Accrued power supply and gas revenue and overrecoveries are
    included in Accrued rate refunds on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. At December 31, 2008, we had $7 million
    recorded as regulatory assets for underrecoveries of power
    supply and gas costs and $7 million recorded as regulatory
    liabilities for overrecoveries of power supply and gas costs.

For additional details, see Note 1, Corporate Structure and
    Accounting Policies - “Utility Regulation.”

Financial
    and Derivative Instruments and Market Risk Information

Financial Instruments:

Debt and equity securities
    classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value
    determined from quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and
    losses resulting from changes in fair value of
    available-for-sale debt and equity securities are reported, net
    of tax, in equity as part of AOCL. Unrealized losses are
    excluded from earnings unless the related changes in fair value
    are determined to be other than temporary.

Derivative Instruments:

We use the criteria in
    SFAS No. 133 to determine if we need to account for
    certain contracts as derivative instruments. These criteria are
    complex and often require significant judgment in applying them
    to specific contracts. If a contract is a derivative and does
    not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception under
    SFAS No. 133, we record it on our consolidated balance
    sheet at its fair value. Each quarter, we adjust the resulting
    asset or liability to reflect any change in the fair value of
    the contract, a practice known as marking the contract to
    market. For additional details on our derivatives, see
    Note 7, Financial and Derivative Instruments.

To determine the fair value of our derivatives, we generally use
    information from external sources, such as quoted market prices
    and other valuation information. For certain contracts, this
    information is not available and we use mathematical models to
    value our derivatives. The most material of our derivative
    liabilities, an electricity sales agreement held by CMS ERM,
    extends beyond the term for which quoted electricity prices are
    available. Thus, to value this derivative we use a valuation
    model that incorporates a proprietary forward pricing curve for
    electricity based on forward natural gas prices and an implied
    heat rate. Our model incorporates discounting, credit, and
    modeling risks. The model is sensitive to electricity and
    natural gas forward prices, and the fair value of this
    derivative liability will increase as these forward prices
    increase. We adjust our model each quarter to incorporate market
    data as it becomes available.

The fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change
    significantly as commodity prices and volatilities change. The
    cash returns we actually realize on our derivatives may be
    different from the fair values that we estimate. For derivatives
    in an asset position, our calculations of fair value include
    reserves of less than $1 million to reflect the credit risk
    of our counterparties. For derivatives in a liability position,
    our calculations include reserves of $1 million to reflect
    our own credit risk. For additional details on how we determine
    the fair values of our derivatives, see Note 2, Fair Value
    Measurements.

The types of contracts we typically classify as derivatives are
    interest rate swaps, financial transmission rights, fixed price
    fuel contracts, natural gas futures, electricity swaps, and
    forward and option contracts for electricity, natural gas, and
    foreign currencies. Most of our commodity purchase and sale
    contracts are not subject to derivative accounting under
    SFAS No. 133 because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units
    specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity
    or bcf of natural gas),

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales
    exception, or

•

there is not an active market for the commodity.

CMS-15


Our coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is
    not an active market for the coal we purchase. If an active
    market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts
    may qualify as derivatives. For Consumers, which is subject to
    regulatory accounting, the resulting mark-to-market gains and
    losses would be offset by changes in regulatory assets and
    liabilities and would not affect net income. For other CMS
    Energy subsidiaries, we do not believe the resulting
    mark-to-market impact on earnings would be material.

CMS ERM Contracts:

In order to support CMS
    Energy’s ongoing non-utility operations, CMS ERM enters
    into contracts to purchase and sell electricity and natural gas
    in the future. These forward contracts are generally long-term
    in nature and result in physical delivery of the commodity at a
    contracted price. To manage commodity price risks associated
    with these forward purchase and sale contracts, CMS ERM also
    uses various financial instruments, such as swaps, options, and
    futures.

In the past, CMS ERM generally classified all of its derivatives
    that result in physical delivery of commodities as non-trading
    contracts and all of its derivatives that financially settle as
    trading contracts. Following the restructuring of our DIG
    investment and the resulting streamlining of CMS ERM’s risk
    management activities in the first quarter of 2008, we
    reevaluated the classification of CMS ERM’s derivatives as
    trading versus non-trading. We determined that all of CMS
    ERM’s derivatives are held for purposes other than trading.
    Therefore, during 2008, we have classified all of CMS ERM’s
    derivatives as non-trading derivatives.

Market Risk Information:

We are exposed to market
    risks including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates,
    commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity
    security prices. We may enter into various risk management
    contracts to limit our exposure to these risks, including swaps,
    options, futures, and forward contracts. We enter into these
    contracts using established policies and procedures, under the
    direction of an executive oversight committee consisting of
    senior management representatives and a risk committee
    consisting of business unit managers.

These contracts contain credit risk, which is the risk that our
    counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations.
    We reduce this risk using established policies and procedures,
    such as evaluating our counterparties’ credit quality and
    setting collateral requirements as necessary. If terms permit,
    we use standard agreements that allow us to net positive and
    negative exposures associated with the same counterparty. Given
    these policies, our current exposures, and our credit reserves,
    we do not expect a material adverse effect on our financial
    position or future earnings because of counterparty
    nonperformance.

The following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss
    in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from our financial
    instruments, including our derivative contracts, assuming a
    hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices of
    10 percent. Potential losses could exceed the amounts shown
    in the sensitivity analyses if changes in market rates or prices
    were to exceed 10 percent.

Interest Rate Risk:

We are exposed to interest rate
    risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate and variable-rate
    financing instruments, and from interest rate swap agreements.
    We use a combination of these instruments to manage this risk as
    deemed appropriate, based upon market conditions. These
    strategies are designed to provide and maintain a balance
    between risk and the lowest cost of capital.

Commodity Price Risk:

Operating in the energy
    industry, we are exposed to commodity price risk, which arises
    from fluctuations in the price of electricity, natural gas,
    coal, and other commodities. Commodity prices are influenced by
    a number of factors, including weather, changes in supply and
    demand, and liquidity of commodity markets. In order to manage
    commodity price risk, we may enter into various non-trading
    derivative contracts, such as forward purchase and sale
    contracts, options, and swaps.

Retirement
    Benefits

Pension:

We have external trust funds to provide
    retirement pension benefits to our employees under a
    non-contributory, defined benefit Pension Plan. On
    September 1, 2005, the defined benefit Pension Plan was
    closed to new participants and we implemented the qualified
    DCCP, which provides an employer contribution of five percent of
    base pay to the existing 401(k) plan. An employee contribution
    is not required to receive the plan’s employer cash
    contribution. All employees hired on or after September 1,
    2005 participate in this plan as part of their retirement
    benefit program. Previous cash balance pension plan participants
    also participate in the DCCP as of September 1, 2005.
    Additional pay credits under the cash balance pension plan were
    discontinued as of that date.

401(k):

We provide an employer match in our 401(k)
    plan equal to 60 percent on eligible contributions up to
    the first six percent of an employee’s wages.

OPEB:

We provide postretirement health and life
    benefits under our OPEB plan to qualifying retired employees.

In accordance with SFAS No. 158, we record liabilities
    for pension and OPEB on our consolidated balance sheet at the
    present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets.
    We use SFAS No. 87 to account for pension expense and
    SFAS No. 106 to account for other postretirement
    benefit expense. The calculation of the liabilities and
    associated expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and
    requires many assumptions, including:

•

life expectancies,

•

discount rates,

•

expected long-term rate of return on plan assets,

•

rate of compensation increases, and

•

anticipated health care costs.

A change in these assumptions could change significantly our
    recorded liabilities and associated expenses.

    OPEB cost, and cash contributions for the next three years:

Contribution estimates include amounts required and

    costs are recoverable through our general ratemaking process.
    Actual future pension cost and contributions will depend on
    future investment performance, changes in future discount rates,
    and various other factors related to the populations
    participating in the Pension Plan.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the Pension
    Plan assets by 0.25 percent (from 8.25 percent to
    8.00 percent) would increase estimated pension cost for
    2009 by $3 million. Lowering the discount rate by
    0.25 percent (from 6.50 percent to 6.25 percent)
    would increase estimated pension cost for 2009 by
    $5 million.

For additional details on postretirement benefits, see
    Note 8, Retirement Benefits.

Accounting
    for Asset Retirement Obligations

We are required to record the fair value of the cost to remove
    assets at the end of their useful lives, if there is a legal
    obligation to remove them. We have legal obligations to remove
    some of our assets at the end of their useful lives. We
    calculate the fair value of ARO liabilities using an expected
    present value technique that reflects assumptions about costs,
    inflation, and profit margin that third parties would consider
    to assume the obligation. We did not include a market risk
    premium in our ARO fair value estimates since a reasonable
    estimate could not be made.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the
    period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with
    indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Generally, our
    gas transmission and electric and gas distribution assets have
    indeterminate lives and retirement cash flows that cannot be
    determined. However, we have recorded an ARO for our obligation
    to cut, purge, and cap abandoned gas distribution mains and gas
    services at the end of their useful lives. We have not recorded
    a liability for assets that have insignificant cumulative
    disposal costs, such as substation batteries. For additional
    details, see Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations.

CAPITAL RESOURCES
    AND LIQUIDITY

Factors affecting our liquidity and capital requirements include:

•

results of operations,

•

capital expenditures,

•

energy commodity and transportation costs,

•

contractual obligations,

•

regulatory decisions,

•

debt maturities,

•

credit ratings,

•

pension plan funding requirements,

•

tendering of our convertible securities by holders for
    conversion,

CMS-18


•

working capital needs,

•

collateral requirements, and

•

access to credit markets.

During the summer months, we buy natural gas and store it for
    resale during the winter heating season. Although our prudent
    natural gas costs are recoverable from our customers, the
    storage of natural gas as inventory requires additional
    liquidity due to the lag in cost recovery.

Components of our cash management plan include controlling
    operating expenses and capital expenditures and evaluating
    market conditions for financing opportunities, if needed. We
    have taken the following actions to strengthen our liquidity:

•

in September 2008, Consumers issued $350 million
    FMB, and

•

in September 2008, Consumers entered into a $150 million
    revolving credit agreement.

In April 2008, we redeemed two of our tax-exempt debt issues
    with $96 million of refinancing proceeds and converted
    $35 million of tax-exempt debt previously backed by
    municipal bond insurers to variable rate demand bonds,
    effectively eliminating our variable rate debt backed by
    municipal bond insurers.

Despite the current market volatility, we expect to be able to
    continue to have access to the capital markets. Consumers’
    accounts receivable sales program is planned for renewal in May
    2009. Of our $1.392 billion in letters of credit and
    revolving credit facilities, $342 million are planned for
    renewal in 2009 and $1.050 billion are planned for renewal
    in 2012. Our senior notes maturities are $300 million in
    2010, $300 million in 2011 and $150 million in 2012.
    Consumers’ FMB maturities are $350 million in 2009,
    $250 million in 2010 and $300 million in 2012. We
    believe that our current level of cash and our anticipated cash
    flows from operating activities, together with access to sources
    of liquidity, will be sufficient to meet cash requirements. If
    access to the capital markets is diminished or otherwise
    restricted, we would implement contingency plans to address debt
    maturities that may include reduced capital spending. For

    Capitalization.

In January 2009, the Board of Directors voted to increase the
    quarterly common stock dividend from $0.09 per share to $0.125
    per share, for the first quarter of 2009. The dividend is
    payable February 27, 2009 to shareholders of record on
    February 6, 2009.

Cash
    Position, Investing, and Financing

Our operating, investing, and financing activities meet
    consolidated cash needs. At December 31, 2008, we had
    $248 million of consolidated cash, which includes
    $35 million of restricted cash and $9 million held by
    entities consolidated under FIN 46(R).

Our primary ongoing source of cash is dividends and other
    distributions from our subsidiaries. Consumers paid
    $297 million in common stock dividends and Enterprises paid
    $950 million in common stock dividends, resulting from 2007
    asset sales, to CMS Energy for the year ended December 31,
    2008. For details on dividend restrictions, see Note 5,
    Financings and Capitalization.

Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include amounts
    related to discontinued operations through the date of disposal.
    The sale of our discontinued operations had no material adverse
    effect on our liquidity, as we used the sales proceeds to invest
    in our utility business and to reduce debt. For additional
    details on discontinued operations, see Note 3, Asset
    Sales, Discontinued Operations and Impairment Charges.

    and amortization, deferred income taxes, postretirement benefits
    expense, asset impairment charges, and other non-cash charges.

2008 versus 2007:

Cash provided by operating activities
    increased primarily as a result of increased earnings and the
    timing of cash receipts from accounts receivable. We accelerate
    our collections from customer billings through the sale of
    accounts receivable. We sold $325 million of accounts
    receivable at the end of 2006, which reduced our collections
    from customers during 2007. We did not sell accounts receivable
    in 2007 and sold $170 million of accounts receivable during
    2008. Also contributing to the increase in cash provided by
    operating activities were lower postretirement benefit
    contributions, the absence, in 2008, of a payment made to settle
    a shareholder class action lawsuit, and other timing
    differences. These increases were partially offset by a payment
    made by CMS ERM in February 2008 to terminate electric sales
    contracts, refunds to customers of excess Palisades
    decommissioning funds, the impact of higher commodity prices on
    inventory purchases, and increased accounts receivable billings
    at the end of 2008 due to regulatory actions and weather-driven
    demand.

2007 versus 2006:

Cash provided by operating activities
    decreased primarily as result of decreased earnings and the
    absence, in 2007, of the sale of accounts receivable. Also
    contributing to the decrease in cash provided by operating
    activities were payments made to fund our Pension Plan and to
    settle a shareholder class action lawsuit, refunds to customers
    of excess Palisades decommissioning funds, and reduced cash
    distributions from international investments sold during 2007.
    These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in
    expenditures for gas inventory, as the milder winter in 2006
    allowed us to accumulate more gas in our storage facilities, the
    absence of the release of the MCV Partnership gas supplier funds
    on deposit due to the sale of our interest in the MCV
    Partnership in 2006, and other timing differences.

2008 versus 2007:

The increase in net cash used in
    investing activities reflects the absence, in 2008, of proceeds
    from asset sales and from our nuclear decommissioning trust
    funds. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in
    capital expenditures resulting from the absence of the Zeeland
    power plant purchase made in 2007.

2007 versus 2006:

The increase in cash provided by
    investing activities was primarily due to proceeds from asset
    sales and the dissolution of our nuclear decommissioning trust
    funds. These changes were partially offset by an increase in
    capital expenditures primarily due to the purchase of the
    Zeeland power plant.

    requirements. These commodities and services include:

•

natural gas and associated transportation,

•

electricity, and

•

coal and associated transportation.

Our purchase obligations include long-term power purchase
    agreements with various generating plants, which require us to
    make monthly capacity payments based on the plants’
    availability or deliverability. These payments will approximate
    $36 million per month during 2009. If a plant is not
    available to deliver electricity, we will not be obligated to
    make these payments for that period. For additional details on
    power supply costs, see “Electric Utility Results of
    Operations” within this MD&A and Note 4,
    Contingencies, “Consumers’ Electric Utility Rate
    Matters — Power Supply Costs.”

Revolving Credit Facilities:

For details on our
    revolving credit facilities, see Note 5, Financings and

Sale of Accounts Receivable:

Under its revolving
    accounts receivable sales program, Consumers may sell up to
    $250 million of eligible accounts receivable at December
    31, 2008, reduced from $325 million at December 31,
    2007.

Capital Expenditures:

For planning purposes, we
    forecast capital expenditures over a three-year period. We
    review these estimates and may revise them, periodically, due to
    a number of factors including environmental regulations,
    business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and
    the ability to access capital. The following is a summary of our
    estimated capital expenditures, including lease commitments, for
    2009 through 2011:

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

CMS Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various
    arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate
    commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements
    include indemnifications, surety bonds, letters of credit, and
    financial and performance guarantees. Indemnifications are
    usually agreements to reimburse a counterparty that may incur
    losses due to outside claims or breach of contract terms. The
    maximum payment we would be required to make under a number of
    these indemnities is not estimable. While we believe it is
    unlikely that we will incur any material losses related to
    indemnifications we have not recorded as liabilities, we cannot
    predict the impact of these contingent obligations on our
    liquidity and financial condition. For additional details on
    these and other guarantee arrangements, see Note 4,
    Contingencies, Other Contingencies — Indemnifications.

OUTLOOK

Corporate
    Outlook

In the future, we will focus our strategy on continuing
    investment in our utility business, growing earnings while
    controlling operating costs and parent debt, and maintaining
    principles of safe, efficient operations, customer value, fair
    and timely regulation, and consistent financial performance.

CMS-23


Our primary focus will be to continue to invest in our utility
    system to enable us to meet our customer commitments, to comply
    with increasingly demanding environmental performance standards,
    to improve system performance, and to maintain adequate supply
    and capacity. Our primary focus with respect to our non-utility
    businesses will be to optimize cash flow and to maximize the
    value of our assets.

ELECTRIC UTILITY
    BUSINESS OUTLOOK

Balanced Energy Initiative:

Our Balanced Energy
    Initiative is a comprehensive energy resource plan to meet our
    projected short-term and long-term electric power requirements
    through:

•

energy efficiency,

•

demand management,

•

expanded use of renewable energy, and

•

development of new power plants and pursuit of additional power
    purchase agreements to complement existing generating sources.

Our Balanced Energy Initiative includes our plan to build an
    800 MW advanced clean coal-based plant at our Karn/Weadock
    Generating complex near Bay City, Michigan. We expect the plant
    to be in operation in 2017. Legislation enacted in Michigan in
    October 2008 provided guidelines with respect to the MPSC review
    and approval of energy resource plans and proposed power plants.
    We plan to file a new case with the MPSC that conforms to the
    new legislation.

Proposed Coal Plant Projects:

In February 2009, the
    Michigan governor issued an executive directive that set forth
    additional requirements for the issuance of a permit to install
    a coal-based electric generating plant in the state of Michigan.
    The directive requires the MDEQ, before issuing an air permit
    for any coal-based electric generating plant, to consider, among
    other things,

•

whether additional generation is needed, and

•

whether other feasible and prudent alternatives to a new coal
    plant exist that would better protect the environment, including
    potential demand reduction measures and purchasing power from
    existing sources.

We are examining the legality of the directive, as well as its
    impact on our existing air permit application for our planned
    advanced clean coal plant. The Michigan attorney general issued
    an opinion that invalidated the governor’s directive on the
    basis that the governor’s directive exceeded the
    governor’s authority.

In February 2009, the Michigan governor also proposed a 45
    percent reduction in the use of fossil fuel for electric
    generation by 2020. The governor’s office has subsequently
    advised us that the 45 percent is only a suggested target, and
    is intended to apply only to coal-based generation. If
    implemented, it will have a significant impact upon the
    operation and cost of existing and planned future coal-based
    power plants.

We cannot predict the impact of the governor’s statements
    or other factors on our future power supply plans.

Electric Customer Revenue Outlook:

Michigan’s
    economy has suffered from closures and restructuring of
    automotive manufacturing facilities and those of related
    suppliers and from the depressed housing market. The Michigan
    economy also has been harmed by the current volatility in the
    credit markets. Although our electric utility results are not
    dependent substantially upon a single customer, or even a few
    customers, those in the automotive sector represented four
    percent of our total 2008 electric revenue and two and a half
    percent of our 2008 electric operating income. We cannot predict
    the financial impact of the Michigan economy on our electric
    customer revenue.

Electric Deliveries:

We experienced a decrease in
    electric deliveries of approximately 3.5 percent in 2008
    compared with 2007, or 2.0 percent excluding impacts from
    differences in weather. This decrease reflects a decline in
    industrial economic activity and the cancellation of one
    wholesale customer contract. For 2009, we expect a decrease in
    electric deliveries of 2.5 percent compared with 2008, or
    2.1 percent excluding impacts from differences in weather.
    Our outlook for 2009 includes continuing growth in deliveries to
    our largest-growing customer, which produces semiconductor and
    solar energy components. Excluding this customer’s growth,
    we expect electric

CMS-24


deliveries in 2009 to decline 3.4 percent compared with
    2008 or 3.0 percent excluding impacts from differences in
    weather. Our outlook reflects reduced deliveries associated with
    our investment in energy efficiency programs included in the
    recently enacted legislation, as well as recent projections of
    Michigan economic conditions.

After 2009, we anticipate economic conditions to stabilize,
    resulting in modestly growing deliveries of electricity. We
    expect deliveries to grow on average about 0.8 percent
    annually over the period from 2009 to 2014. This growth rate
    also includes expected results of energy efficiency programs and
    both full-service sales and delivery service to customers who
    choose to buy generation service from an alternative electric
    supplier, but transactions with other wholesale market
    participants are not included. Actual growth may vary from this
    trend due to the following:

•

energy conservation measures and results of energy efficiency
    programs,

•

fluctuations in weather, and

•

changes in economic conditions, including utilization and
    expansion or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population
    trends, and housing activity.

Electric Reserve Margin:

To reduce the risk of high
    power supply costs during peak demand periods and to achieve our
    Reserve Margin target, we purchase electric capacity and energy
    for the physical delivery of electricity primarily in the summer
    months. We are currently planning for a Reserve Margin of
    12.7 percent for summer 2009, or supply resources equal to
    112.7 percent of projected firm summer peak load. We have
    purchased capacity and energy covering our Reserve Margin
    requirements for 2009 through 2010. Of the 2009 supply resources
    target, we expect 96.4 percent to come from our electric
    generating plants and long-term power purchase contracts, with
    other capacity and energy contractual arrangements making up the
    remainder. We expect capacity costs for these electric capacity
    and energy contractual arrangements to be $15 million for
    2009.

Electric Transmission Expenses:

We expect the
    transmission charges we incur to increase by $55 million in
    2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a 25 percent
    increase in METC and Wolverine transmission rates. This increase
    was included in our 2009 PSCR plan filed with the MPSC in
    September 2008.

The MPSC issued an order that allowed transmission expenses to
    be included in the PSCR process. The Attorney General appealed
    the MPSC order to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which affirmed
    the MPSC order. The Attorney General filed an application for
    leave to appeal with the Michigan Supreme Court, which was
    granted in September 2008. We cannot predict the financial
    impact or outcome of this matter.

For additional details on the electric transmission expense
    litigation, see Note 4, Contingencies,
    “Consumers’ Electric Utility Contingencies
    -Litigation.”

Renewable Energy Plan:

Legislation enacted in
    Michigan in October 2008 prescribed renewable energy standards
    for energy and capacity. The energy standard requires that
    10 percent of our electric sales volume come from renewable
    sources by 2015 with interim target requirements. Approximately
    four percent of our electric sales volume comes presently from
    renewable sources. The legislation also requires us to add new
    renewable energy capacity of 200 MW by year-end 2013 and
    500 MW by year-end 2015, from owned renewable energy
    sources or power purchased agreements. We have secured more than
    36,000 acres of land easements in Michigan’s Tuscola
    and Mason counties for potential wind generation development and
    we are collecting presently wind speed and other meteorological
    data at the sites.

In February 2009, we filed our Renewable Energy Plan with the
    MPSC. The plan details how we will meet the renewable energy
    standards for energy and capacity.

Energy Optimization Plan:

Legislation enacted in
    Michigan in October 2008 requires utilities to prepare energy
    optimization plans and achieve annual sales reduction targets
    beginning in 2009 through 2015. In February 2009, we filed our
    Energy Optimization Plan with the MPSC, which details our
    proposed energy cost savings plan through incentives to reduce
    customer usage among all customer classes and the method of
    recovery of program costs.

Ancillary Services:

In January 2009, MISO
    implemented an ancillary services market for the purchase and
    sale of regulation and contingency reserves. We include
    ancillary service costs in our PSCR.

CMS-25


ELECTRIC UTILITY
    BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES

Several electric business trends and uncertainties may affect
    our financial condition and future results of operations. These
    trends and uncertainties could have a material impact on
    revenues and income from continuing electric operations.

Electric Environmental Estimates:

Our operations are
    subject to various state and federal environmental laws and
    regulations. Generally, we have been able to recover in customer
    rates our costs to operate our facilities in compliance with
    these laws and regulations.

Clean Air Act:

We continue to focus on complying
    with the federal Clean Air Act and numerous state and federal
    regulations. We plan to spend $817 million for equipment
    installation through 2017 to comply with a number of
    environmental regulations, including regulations limiting
    nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions. We expect to
    recover these costs in customer rates.

We plan to purchase additional nitrogen oxides emission
    allowances through 2010 at an estimated cost of $5 million
    per year. We also plan to purchase sulfur dioxide emission
    allowances, between 2013 and 2015, at an expected cost ranging
    from $9 million to $27 million per year. We expect to
    recover emissions allowance costs from our customers through the
    PSCR process.

Clean Air Interstate Rule:

In March 2005, the EPA
    adopted the CAIR, which required additional coal-based electric
    generating plant emission controls for nitrogen oxides and
    sulfur dioxide. The CAIR was appealed to the U.S. Court of
    Appeals for the District of Columbia. The court initially
    vacated the CAIR and the CAIR federal implementation plan in
    their entirety, but subsequently, the court changed course and
    remanded the rule to the EPA maintaining the rule in effect
    pending EPA revision. As a result, the CAIR still remains in
    effect, with the first annual nitrogen oxides compliance year
    beginning January 1, 2009. The EPA must now revise the rule
    to resolve the court’s concerns. The court did not set a
    timetable for the revision.

State and Federal Mercury Air Rules:

In March 2005,
    the EPA issued the CAMR, which required initial reductions of
    mercury emissions from coal-based electric generating plants by
    2010 and further reductions by 2018. A number of states and
    other entities appealed certain portions of the CAMR to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia decided
    the case in February 2008, and determined that the rules
    developed by the EPA were not consistent with the Clean Air Act.
    The U.S. Supreme Court has been petitioned to review this
    decision.

In April 2006, Michigan’s governor proposed a plan that
    would result in mercury emissions reductions of 90 percent
    by 2015. The MDEQ is reviewing public comments made in response
    to a newly released mercury emissions reduction proposal. If
    this plan becomes effective, we estimate that the associated
    costs will be approximately $782 million by 2015.

Routine Maintenance Classification:

The EPA has
    alleged that some utilities have incorrectly classified major
    plant modifications as RMRR rather than seeking permits from the
    EPA to modify their plants. We responded to information requests
    from the EPA on this subject in 2000, 2002, and 2006. We believe
    that we have properly interpreted the requirements of RMRR. In
    October 2008, we received another information request from the
    EPA under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act. We responded to
    this information request in December 2008.

In addition to the EPA’s information request, in October
    2008, we received a NOV for three of our coal-based facilities
    relating to violations of NSR regulations, alleging ten projects
    from 1986 to 1998 were subject to NSR review. We met with the
    EPA in January 2009 and have additional meetings scheduled. If
    the EPA does not accept our interpretation of RMRR, we could be
    required to install additional pollution control equipment at
    some or all of our coal-based electric generating plants,
    surrender emission allowances, engage in supplemental
    environmental programs or pay fines. Additionally, we would need
    to assess the viability of continuing operations at certain
    plants. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    this matter.

Greenhouse Gases:

The United States Congress has
    introduced proposals that would require reductions in emissions
    of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. We consider it
    likely that Congress will enact greenhouse gas legislation, but
    the form of any final bill is difficult to predict. These laws,
    or similar state laws or rules, if enacted, could require us to
    replace equipment, install additional equipment for emission
    controls, purchase

CMS-26


allowances, curtail operations, arrange for alternative sources
    of supply, or take other steps to manage or lower the emission
    of greenhouse gases. Although associated capital or operating
    costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could
    be material, and cost recovery cannot be assured, we expect to
    have an opportunity to recover these costs and capital
    expenditures in rates consistent with the recovery of other
    reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and
    regulations.

In July 2008, the EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed
    Rulemaking to present possible options for regulating greenhouse
    gases under the Clean Air Act, as well as to solicit comments
    and additional ideas. We submitted comments to the EPA on this
    issue in November 2008. In addition to the potential for federal
    actions related to greenhouse gas regulation, the State of
    Michigan has convened the Michigan Climate Action Council, a
    climate change stakeholder process. Michigan is also a signatory
    participant in the Midwest Governors Greenhouse Gas Reduction
    Accord process. We cannot predict the extent or the likelihood
    of any actions that could result from these state and regional
    processes.

Water:

In July 2004, the EPA issued rules that
    govern existing electric generating plant cooling water intake
    systems. These rules require a significant reduction in the
    number of fish harmed by intake structures at existing power
    plants. The EPA compliance options in the rule were challenged
    before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
    which remanded the bulk of the rule back to the EPA for
    reconsideration in January 2007. In April 2008, the
    U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an industry challenge to
    the appellate court ruling in this case. A decision from the U.S
    Supreme Court is expected in the first half of 2009. The EPA is
    planning to issue a revised draft rule in 2009, following the
    court decision.

We estimate that capital expenditures to comply with these
    regulations will be approximately $128 million; however an
    unfavorable U.S. Supreme Court decision could increase
    expenditures significantly.

We will continue to monitor these developments and respond to
    their potential implications for our business, consolidated
    results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. For
    additional details on electric environmental matters, see
    Note 4, Contingencies, “Consumers’ Electric
    Utility Contingencies - Electric Environmental Matters.”

Stranded Cost Recovery:

In October 2008, the
    Michigan legislature enacted legislation that amended the
    Customer Choice Act and directed the MPSC to approve rates that
    will allow recovery of Stranded Costs within five years. In
    January 2009, we filed an application with the MPSC requesting
    recovery of these Stranded Costs through a surcharge on both
    full service and ROA customers. At December 31, 2008, we
    had a regulatory asset for Stranded Costs of $71 million.

Electric Rate Case:

In November 2008, we filed an
    application with the MPSC seeking an annual increase in revenue
    of $214 million based on an 11 percent authorized
    return on equity. The filing seeks recovery of costs associated
    with new plant investments including Clean Air Act investments,
    higher operating and maintenance costs, and the approval to
    recover costs associated with our advanced metering
    infrastructure program. The Michigan legislation enacted in
    October 2008 generally allows utilities to self-implement rates
    six months after filing, subject to refund, unless the MPSC
    finds good cause to prohibit such self-implementation. We cannot
    predict the financial impact or outcome of this proceeding.

Palisades Regulatory Proceedings:

We sold Palisades
    to Entergy in April 2007. The MPSC order approving the
    transaction required that we credit $255 million of excess
    sale proceeds and decommissioning amounts to our retail
    customers by December 2008. There are additional excess sales
    proceeds and decommissioning fund balances of $109 million
    above the amount in the MPSC order. The distribution of these
    funds is still pending with the MPSC.

For additional details on electric rate matters, see
    Note 4, Contingencies, “Consumers’ Electric
    Utility Rate Matters.”

GAS UTILITY
    BUSINESS OUTLOOK

Gas Deliveries:

For 2009, we expect gas deliveries
    to decrease by 3.4 percent compared with 2008, or
    4.7 percent, excluding impacts from differences in weather,
    due to continuing conservation and overall economic

CMS-27


conditions in Michigan. We expect gas deliveries to average a
    decline of less than 1.6 percent annually over the next
    five years. Actual delivery levels from year to year may vary
    from this trend due to the following:

•

fluctuations in weather,

•

use by independent power producers,

•

availability and development of renewable energy sources,

•

changes in gas prices,

•

Michigan economic conditions including population trends and
    housing activity,

•

the price of competing energy sources or fuels, and

•

energy efficiency and conservation.

GAS UTILITY
    BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES

Several gas business trends and uncertainties may affect our
    future financial results and financial condition. These trends
    and uncertainties could have a material impact on future
    revenues and income from gas operations.

Gas Environmental Estimates:

We expect to incur
    investigation and remedial action costs at a number of sites,
    including 23 former manufactured gas plant sites. For additional
    details, see Note 4, Contingencies, “Consumers’
    Gas Utility Contingencies — Gas Environmental
    Matters.”

Gas Cost Recovery:

The GCR process is designed to
    allow us to recover all of our purchased natural gas costs if
    incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.
    The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices for
    prudence in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. For
    additional details on GCR, see Note 4, Contingencies,
    “Consumers’ Gas Utility Rate Matters — Gas
    Cost Recovery.”

Gas Depreciation:

On August 1, 2008, we filed a
    gas depreciation case using 2007 data with the MPSC-ordered
    variations on traditional cost-of-removal methodologies. In
    December 2008, the MPSC approved a partial settlement agreement
    allowing us to implement the filed depreciation rates, on an
    interim basis, concurrent with the implementation of settled
    rates in our 2008 gas rate case. The interim depreciation rates
    reduce our depreciation expense by approximately
    $20 million per year and will remain in effect until a
    final order is issued in our gas depreciation case. If a final
    order in our gas depreciation case is not issued concurrently
    with a final order in a general gas rate case, the MPSC may
    incorporate the results of the depreciation case into general
    gas rates through a surcharge, which may be either positive or
    negative.

Lost and Unaccounted for Gas:

Gas utilities
    typically lose a portion of gas as it is injected into and
    withdrawn from storage and sent through transmission and
    distribution systems. We recover the cost of lost and
    unaccounted for gas through general rate cases, which have
    traditionally provided for recovery based on an average of the
    previous five years of actual losses. To the extent that we
    experience lost and unaccounted for gas that exceeds the
    previous five-year average, we may be unable to recover these
    amounts in rates.

ENTERPRISES
    OUTLOOK

Our primary focus with respect to our remaining non-utility
    businesses is to optimize cash flow and maximize the value of
    our assets.

In connection with the sale of our Argentine and Michigan assets
    to Lucid Energy in March 2007, we entered into agreements that
    granted MEI, an affiliate of Lucid Energy, rights to certain
    awards or proceeds that we could receive in the future. At
    December 31, 2008, $7 million remains as a deferred
    credit on our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to MEI’s
    right to proceeds that Enterprises will receive if it sells its
    stock interest in CMS Generation San Nicolas Company.

Enterprises Uncertainties:

Trends and uncertainties
    that could have a material impact on our consolidated income,
    cash flows, or balance sheet include:

•

the impact of indemnity and environmental remediation
    obligations at Bay Harbor,

CMS-28


•

the outcome of certain legal proceedings,

•

the impact of representations, warranties, and indemnities we
    provided in connection with the sales of our international
    assets, and

•

changes in commodity prices and interest rates on certain
    derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting
    and must be marked to market through earnings.

For additional details regarding Enterprises Uncertainties, see
    Note 4, Contingencies and Part I, Item 3. Legal
    Proceedings.

OTHER
    OUTLOOK

Advanced Metering Infrastructure:

We are developing
    an advanced metering system that will provide enhanced controls
    and information about our customer energy usage and notification
    of service interruptions. The system also will allow customers
    to make decisions about energy efficiency and conservation,
    provide other customer benefits, and reduce costs. We expect to
    develop integration software and pilot new technology over the
    next two to three years, and incur capital expenditures of
    approximately $800 million over the next seven years for
    the full deployment of these “smart meters.”

Emergency Shutoff Protection Rules:

In February
    2009, the MPSC issued rules that would put additional emergency
    shutoff protections and service limitation protections in place
    for our residential electric and natural gas customers. The
    protection exceeds previous shutoff rules as follows:

•

extends the protection period from March 31, 2009 to
    April 30, 2009,

•

includes protection for physically or mentally disabled
    customers of record,

•

expands the qualifications for low income shutoff protection, and

•

gives customers the payment options.

We are presently evaluating the impacts of these rules on our
    cash flows and financial position.

Litigation and Regulatory Investigation:

We are the
    subject of an investigation by the DOJ regarding inaccurate
    pricing information provided by CMS MST to certain market
    publications. Also, we are named as a party in various
    litigation matters including, but not limited to, several
    lawsuits regarding alleged false natural gas price reporting and
    price manipulation and the appeal initiated by Quicksilver in
    the Texas Court of Appeals. Additionally, the SEC is
    investigating the actions of former CMS Energy subsidiaries in
    relation to Equatorial Guinea. For additional details regarding
    these and other matters, see Note 4, Contingencies and
    Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 —
    Mark-to-Market Accounting:

In October 2008, President
    Bush signed into law a $700 billion economic recovery plan.
    The plan included a provision authorizing the SEC to suspend the
    application of SFAS No. 157 for any issuer with
    respect to any class or category of transaction as deemed
    necessary. In addition, the SEC was required to conduct a study
    on mark-to-market accounting (fair value accounting), including
    its possible impacts on recent bank failures, along with a
    consideration of alternative accounting treatments. In late
    December 2008, the SEC submitted a report on its study to
    Congress. The report concluded that mark-to-market accounting
    was not a major factor in recent bank failures, and recommended
    that existing fair value and mark-to-market accounting
    requirements remain in place. The report included
    recommendations for improving fair value accounting and
    reporting. We apply this accounting primarily to our derivative
    instruments and our SERP investments, and we will continue to
    monitor developments relating to the SEC report, including
    reactions and responses to the report’s recommendations,
    for potential impact to us.

EnerBank:

EnerBank, a wholly owned subsidiary
    representing one percent of CMS Energy’s net assets, is a
    state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing
    unsecured home improvement loans. The carrying value of
    EnerBank’s loan portfolio was $190 million at
    December 31, 2008 and was funded by deposit liabilities of
    $176 million. Twelve-month rolling average default rates on
    loans held by EnerBank have risen from 1.0 percent at

CMS-29


December 31, 2007 to 1.4 percent at December 31,
    2008. Due to recent economic events, EnerBank expects the level
    of loan defaults to continue to increase throughout 2009 and
    into 2010, returning to lower levels thereafter.

IMPLEMENTATION OF
    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
    Measurements:

This standard, which was effective for us
    January 1, 2008, defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. The implementation of this
    standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated
    financial statements. For additional details on our fair value
    measurements, see Note 2, Fair Value Measurements.

SEC / FASB Guidance on Fair Value
    Measurements:

In September 2008, in response to
    concerns about fair value accounting and its possible role in
    the recent declines in the financial markets, the SEC Office of
    the Chief Accountant and the FASB staff jointly released
    additional guidance on fair value measurements. The guidance,
    which was effective for us upon issuance, did not change or
    conflict with the fair value principles in
    SFAS No. 157, but rather provided further
    clarification on how to value a financial asset in an illiquid
    market. This guidance had no impact on our fair value
    measurements.

FSP

FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market
    for That Asset Is Not Active

:

In October 2008,
    the FASB issued this standard, effective for us for the quarter
    ended September 30, 2008. The standard clarifies the
    application of SFAS No. 157 in measuring financial
    assets in illiquid markets and is consistent with the guidance
    issued by the SEC and the FASB as discussed in the preceding
    paragraph, but an example is provided to illustrate the
    concepts. The standard was to be applied prospectively. The
    guidance in this standard did not impact our fair value
    measurements.

SFAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R):

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 158. Phase one of this standard, implemented
    in December 2006, required us to recognize the funded status of
    our defined benefit postretirement plans on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006. Phase two, implemented
    in January 2008, required us to change our plan measurement date
    from November 30 to December 31, effective for the year
    ending December 31, 2008. For additional details, see
    Note 8, Retirement Benefits.

SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial
    Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment to FASB
    Statement No. 115:

This standard, which was
    effective for us January 1, 2008, gives us the option to
    measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair
    value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. We
    have not elected the fair value option for any financial
    instruments or other items.

FSP

FIN 39-1,

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39:

This
    standard, which was effective for us January 1, 2008,
    permits us to offset the fair value of derivative instruments
    held under master netting arrangements with cash collateral
    received or paid for those derivatives. Adopting this standard
    resulted in an immaterial reduction to both our total assets and
    total liabilities. There was no impact on earnings from adopting
    this standard. We applied the standard retrospectively for all
    periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. For
    additional details, see Note 7, Financial and Derivative
    Instruments.

EITF Issue

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based
    Payment Awards:

This standard, which was effective for
    us January 1, 2008, requires companies to recognize, as an
    increase to additional paid-in capital, the income tax benefit
    realized from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged
    to retained earnings and paid to employees for non-vested
    equity-classified employee share-based payment awards. This
    standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated
    financial statements.

In September 2008, the FASB
    issued this standard, effective for us December 31, 2008.
    This standard amended SFAS No. 133 and FIN 45 to
    require enhanced disclosures for issuers of credit derivatives
    and financial guarantees. We have not issued any credit
    derivatives; thus, this standard applies only to our disclosures
    about guarantees we have issued. This standard involves
    disclosures only, and did not

    requires companies to provide additional details about their
    continuing involvement with transferred financial assets and
    their involvement with VIEs. This standard involves disclosures
    only, and did not impact our consolidated income, cash flows, or
    financial position. For additional details, see Note 5,
    Financings and Capitalization, “Sale of Accounts

    Interest Entities.

NEW ACCOUNTING
    STANDARDS NOT YET EFFECTIVE

SFAS No. 141(R),

Business
    Combinations:

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 141(R), which replaces
    SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

.
    SFAS No. 141(R) establishes how an acquiring entity
    should measure and recognize assets acquired, liabilities
    assumed, and noncontrolling interests acquired through a
    business combination. The standard also establishes how goodwill
    or gains from bargain purchases should be measured and
    recognized, and what information the acquirer should disclose to
    enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature
    and financial effects of a business combination. Costs of an
    acquisition are to be recognized separately from the business
    combination. We will apply SFAS No. 141(R)
    prospectively to any business combination for which the date of
    acquisition is on or after January 1, 2009.

SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment to
    ARB No. 51:

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 160, effective for us January 1, 2009.
    Under this standard, ownership interests in subsidiaries held by
    third parties, which are currently referred to as minority
    interests, will be presented as noncontrolling interests and
    shown separately on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within
    equity. In addition, net income (loss) attributable to
    noncontrolling interests will be included in net income on our
    Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). These changes involve
    presentation only, and will not otherwise impact our
    consolidated financial statements. The standard will also affect
    the accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership
    interest, including deconsolidation of a subsidiary. We will
    apply these provisions of SFAS No. 160 prospectively
    to any such transactions.

SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 133:

In March 2008, the FASB
    issued SFAS No. 161, effective for us January 1,
    2009. This standard requires entities to provide enhanced
    disclosures about how and why derivatives are used, how
    derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for under
    SFAS No. 133, and how derivatives and related hedged
    items affect the entity’s financial position, financial
    performance, and cash flows. This standard will not have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

FSP

FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets:

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 142-3,

effective for us January 1, 2009. This standard amends
    SFAS No. 142 to require expanded consideration of
    expected future renewals or extensions of intangible assets when
    determining their useful lives. This standard will be applied
    prospectively for intangible assets acquired after the effective
    date. This standard will not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

FSP APB

14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled In Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement):

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB

14-1,

effective for us January 1, 2009 with retrospective
    application required. This standard will apply to our
    convertible debt securities, and will require us to account for
    the liability and equity components of these securities
    separately and in a manner that will reflect our borrowing rate
    for nonconvertible debt. We expect that the retrospective
    implementation of this standard will result in a reduction of
    Long-term debt of approximately $22 million, an increase in
    Current deferred income tax liabilities of approximately
    $3 million, an increase of Non-current deferred income tax
    liabilities of $6 million, an increase of Other paid-in
    capital of approximately $37 million, and an increase of
    Accumulated deficit of approximately $24 million as of
    January 1, 2009. We further expect that the implementation
    of this standard will increase reported interest expense, net of
    taxes, by approximately $4 million in 2009. For additional
    details on our convertible debt instruments, see Note 5,
    Financings and Capitalization.

CMS-31


FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating
    Securities:

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

effective for us January 1, 2009 with retrospective
    application required. Under this standard, share-based payment
    awards that accrue cash dividends when common shareholders
    receive dividends are considered participating securities if the
    dividends do not need to be returned to the company when the
    employee forfeits the award. This standard will apply to our
    outstanding unvested restricted stock awards, which will be
    considered participating securities and thus will be included in
    the computation of basic EPS. Had this standard been in place in
    2008, it would have reduced 2008 basic and diluted EPS by
    approximately $0.01. We consider this figure to be
    representative of the potential impact of this standard on
    future years’ EPS.

EITF Issue

07-5,

Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock:

In June
    2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

07-5,

effective for us January 1, 2009. This standard establishes
    criteria for determining whether freestanding instruments or
    embedded features are considered “indexed to an
    entity’s own stock” for the purpose of assessing
    potential derivative accounting or balance sheet classification
    issues. The standard applies to all outstanding instruments at
    January 1, 2009, with any transition impacts recognized as
    a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of
    retained earnings. This guidance applies to the equity
    conversion features in our contingently convertible senior notes
    and preferred stock. These conversion features have been
    exempted from derivative accounting because they are indexed to
    our own stock and would be classified in stockholders’
    equity. These features are still considered indexed to our own
    stock under this new guidance, and thus, this standard will have
    no impact on our consolidated financial statements.

EITF Issue

08-5,

Issuer’s Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
    with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement:

In September
    2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

08-5,

effective for us January 1, 2009. This guidance concludes
    that the fair value measurement of a liability should not
    consider the effect of a third-party credit enhancement or
    guarantee supporting the liability. The fair value of the
    liability should thus reflect the credit standing of the issuer
    and should not be adjusted to reflect the credit standing of a
    third-party guarantor. The standard is to be applied
    prospectively. This standard will not have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

FSP FAS 132(R)-1,

Employers’ Disclosures about
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets:

In December
    2008, the FASB issued this standard, effective for us for the
    year ending December 31, 2009. The standard requires
    expanded annual disclosures about the plan assets in our defined
    benefit pension and OPEB plans. The required disclosures include
    information about investment allocation decisions, major
    categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques
    used in the fair value measurements, the effects of significant
    unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets, and significant
    concentrations of risk within plan assets. The standard involves
    disclosures only, and will not impact our consolidated income,
    cash flows, or financial position.

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES
    TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1: CORPORATE
    STRUCTURE AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Corporate Structure:

CMS Energy is an energy company
    operating primarily in Michigan. We are the parent holding
    company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers and
    Enterprises. Consumers is a combination electric and gas utility
    company serving Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Enterprises,
    through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged
    primarily in domestic independent power production. We manage
    our businesses by the nature of services each provides and
    operate principally in three business segments: electric
    utility, gas utility, and enterprises.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated
    financial statements comprise CMS Energy, Consumers,
    Enterprises, and all other entities in which we have a
    controlling financial interest or are the primary beneficiary,
    in accordance with FIN 46(R). We use the equity method of
    accounting for investments in companies and partnerships that
    are not consolidated, where we have significant influence over
    operations and financial policies, but are not the primary
    beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany transactions and balances.

Use of Estimates:

We prepare our consolidated
    financial statements in conformity with GAAP. We are required to
    make estimates using assumptions that may affect the reported
    amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

We record estimated liabilities for contingencies in our
    consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred and when the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. For additional details, see Note 4,
    Contingencies.

Revenue Recognition Policy:

We recognize revenues
    from deliveries of electricity and natural gas, and from the
    transportation, processing, and storage of natural gas when
    services are provided. We record unbilled revenues for the
    estimated amount of energy delivered to customers but not yet
    billed. Unbilled revenues are estimated by applying an average
    billed rate for each customer class based on actual billed
    volume distributions. Our unbilled revenues, which are recorded
    as Accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, were
    $507 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $490 million at December 31, 2007. We record sales tax
    on a net basis and exclude it from revenues. We recognize
    revenues on sales of marketed electricity, natural gas, and
    other energy products at delivery.

Accounting for Legal Fees:

We expense legal fees as
    incurred; fees incurred but not yet billed are accrued based on
    estimates of work performed. This policy also applies to fees
    incurred on behalf of employees and officers related to
    indemnification agreements; these fees are billed directly to us.

Accounting for MISO Transactions:

MISO requires that
    we submit hourly day-ahead and real-time bids and offers for
    energy at locations across the MISO region. Consumers and CMS
    ERM account for MISO transactions on a net hourly basis in each
    of the real-time and day-ahead markets, and net transactions
    across all MISO energy market locations. We record net purchases
    in a single hour in “Purchased and interchange power”
    and net sales in a single hour in “Operating Revenue”
    in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). We record net
    sale billing adjustments when we receive invoices. We record
    expense accruals for future net purchases adjustments based on
    historical experience, and reconcile accruals to actual expenses
    when we receive invoices.

Capitalized Interest:

We capitalize interest on
    certain qualifying assets that are undergoing activities to
    prepare them for their intended use. Capitalization of interest
    is limited to the actual interest cost incurred. Consumers
    capitalizes AFUDC on regulated construction projects and
    includes these amounts in plant in service.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents
    include short-term, highly liquid investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Collective Bargaining Agreements:

At
    December 31, 2008, the Union represented 45 percent of
    Consumers’ employees. The Union represents Consumers’
    operating, maintenance, construction, and call center employees.

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Determination of Pension and OPEB MRV of Plan
    Assets:

We determine the MRV for pension plan assets,
    as defined in SFAS No. 87, as the fair value of plan
    assets on the measurement date, adjusted by the gains or losses
    that will not be admitted into MRV until future years. We
    reflect each year’s assets gain or loss in MRV in equal
    amounts over a five-year period beginning on the date the
    original amount was determined. We determine the MRV for OPEB
    plan assets, as defined in SFAS No. 106, as the fair
    value of assets on the measurement date. We use the MRV in the
    calculation of net pension and OPEB costs.

Earnings Per Share:

We calculate basic and diluted
    EPS using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
    and dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the
    period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining
    diluted EPS, includes the effects of dilutive stock options,
    warrants and convertible securities. We compute the effect on
    potential common stock using the treasury stock method or the
    if-converted method, as applicable. Diluted EPS excludes the
    impact of antidilutive securities, which are those securities
    resulting in an increase in EPS or a decrease in loss per share.
    For EPS computation, see Note 6, Earnings Per Share.

Financial and Derivative Instruments:

We record debt
    and equity securities classified as available-for-sale at fair
    value determined primarily from quoted market prices. On a
    specific identification basis, we report unrealized gains and
    losses from changes in fair value of certain available-for-sale
    debt and equity securities, net of tax, in equity as part of
    AOCL. We exclude unrealized losses from earnings unless the
    related changes in fair value are determined to be other than
    temporary.

In accordance with SFAS No. 133, if a contract is a
    derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and
    sales exception, we record it on our Consolidated Balance Sheets
    at its fair value. If a derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge
    accounting, we report changes in its fair value in AOCL;
    otherwise, we report the changes in earnings.

For additional details regarding financial and derivative
    instruments, see Note 7, Financial and Derivative
    Instruments.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method
    Investments:

We perform tests of impairment if certain
    triggering events occur, or if there has been a decline in value
    that may be other than temporary.

We evaluate our long-lived assets

held-in-use

for impairment by calculating the undiscounted future cash flows
    expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
    disposition. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than
    the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss equal to
    the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.
    We estimate the fair value of the asset using quoted market
    prices, market prices of similar assets, or discounted future
    cash flow analyses.

We also assess our equity method investments for impairment
    whenever there has been a decline in value that is other than
    temporary. This assessment requires us to determine the fair
    values of our equity method investments. We determine fair value
    using valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows,
    and we assess the ability of the investee to sustain an earnings
    capacity that justifies the carrying amount of the investment.
    We record an impairment if the fair value is less than the
    carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be
    other than temporary.

For additional details, see Note 3, Asset Sales,
    Discontinued Operations and Impairment Charges.

International Operations and Foreign Currency:

We
    completed the sale of our international assets in 2007.
    Previously, our subsidiaries and affiliates whose functional
    currency was not the U.S. dollar translated their assets
    and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in
    effect at the end of the fiscal period. We translated revenue
    and expense accounts of these subsidiaries and affiliates into
    U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates that prevailed
    during the period. We showed these foreign currency translation
    adjustments in the stockholders’ equity

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

section on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We include exchange
    rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency
    other than the functional currency, except those that are
    hedged, in determining net income.

For additional details on the sale of our international assets,
    see Note 3, Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations and
    Impairment Charges.

Inventory:

We use the weighted-average cost method
    for valuing working gas, recoverable cushion gas in underground
    storage facilities, and materials and supplies inventory. We
    also use this method for valuing coal inventory, and we classify
    these costs as generating plant fuel stock on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

We classify emission allowances as materials and supplies
    inventory and use the average cost method to remove amounts from
    inventory as we use the emission allowances to generate power.

Maintenance and Depreciation:

We charge property
    repairs and minor property replacement to maintenance expense.
    We use the direct expense method to account for planned major
    maintenance activities. We charge planned major maintenance
    activities to operating expense unless the cost represents the
    acquisition of additional components or the replacement of an
    existing component. We capitalize the cost of plant additions
    and replacements.

We depreciate utility property using a composite method, in
    which we apply a single MPSC-approved depreciation rate to the
    gross investment in a particular class of property within the
    electric and gas divisions. We perform depreciation studies
    periodically to determine appropriate group lives. The composite
    depreciation rates for our properties are as follows:

Property, Plant, and Equipment:

We record property,
    plant, and equipment at original cost when placed into service.
    When utility property is retired, or otherwise disposed of in
    the ordinary course of business, we charge the original cost to
    accumulated depreciation, along with associated cost of removal,
    net of salvage. We recognize gains or losses on the retirement
    or disposal of non-regulated assets in income. Our internal-use
    computer software costs are capitalized or expensed in
    accordance with Statement of

Position 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use.

For additional details, see
    Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations and Note 13,
    Property, Plant, and Equipment. Cost of removal collected from
    our customers, but not spent, is recorded as a regulatory
    liability.

    AFUDC represents the estimated cost of debt and a reasonable

Property Taxes:

Property taxes are based upon the
    taxable value of Consumers’ real and personal property
    assessed by local units of government within the State of
    Michigan. We record property tax expense ratably over the fiscal
    year of the taxing authority for which the taxes are levied
    based on budgeted Consumers’ customer sales. The deferred
    property tax balance represents the amount of Consumers’
    accrued property tax, which will be recognized over future
    governmental fiscal periods.

Reclassifications:

We have reclassified certain
    prior-period amounts on our Consolidated Financial Statements to
    conform to the presentation for the current period. These
    reclassifications did not affect consolidated net income (loss)
    or cash flows for the periods presented.

Restricted Cash:

We classify restricted cash
    dedicated for repayment of Securitization bonds as a current
    asset, as the related payments occur within one year.

Trade Receivables and Notes Receivable:

Accounts
    receivable are primarily composed of trade receivables and
    unbilled receivables. We record our accounts receivable at cost
    which approximates fair value. We establish an allowance for
    uncollectible accounts and loan losses based on historical
    losses and management’s assessment of existing economic
    conditions, customer trends, and other factors. We assess late
    payment fees on trade receivables based on contractual past-due
    terms established with customers. We charge accounts deemed
    uncollectible to operating expense.

At December 31, 2008, Non-current notes receivable included
    EnerBank’s loans totaling $186 million, net of an
    allowance for loan losses of $4 million. EnerBank provides
    unsecured, fixed-rate installment loans to homeowners to finance
    the purchase of home improvements.

Unamortized Debt Premium, Discount, and Expense:

We
    capitalize premiums, discounts, and issuance costs of long-term
    debt and amortize those costs over the terms of the debt issues.
    For the non-regulated portions of our businesses, we expense any
    refinancing costs as incurred. For the regulated portions of our
    businesses, if we refinance debt, we capitalize any remaining
    unamortized premiums, discounts, and issuance costs and amortize
    them over the terms of the newly issued debt.

Utility Regulation:

Consumers is subject to the
    actions of the MPSC and the FERC and prepares its consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 71. As a result, Consumers may defer or
    recognize revenues and expenses differently than a non-regulated
    entity. For example, Consumers may record as regulatory assets
    items that a non-regulated entity normally would expense if the
    actions of the regulator indicate that Consumers will recover
    the expenses in future rates. Conversely, Consumers may record
    as regulatory liabilities items that non-regulated entities may
    normally recognize as revenues if the actions of the regulator
    indicate that Consumers will be required to refund the revenues
    to customers.

We reflect the following regulatory assets and liabilities,
    which include both current and non-current amounts, on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

New Accounting Standards Not Yet
    Effective:

SFAS No. 141(R), Business
    Combinations:

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 141(R), which replaces
    SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations.
    SFAS No. 141(R) establishes how an acquiring entity
    should measure and recognize assets acquired, liabilities
    assumed, and noncontrolling interests acquired through a
    business combination. The standard also establishes how goodwill
    or gains from bargain purchases should be measured and
    recognized and what information the acquirer should disclose to
    enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature
    and financial effects of a business combination. Costs of an
    acquisition are to be recognized separately from the business
    combination. We will apply SFAS No. 141(R)
    prospectively to any business combination for which the date of
    acquisition is on or after January 1, 2009.

SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment to
    ARB No. 51:

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 160, effective for us January 1, 2009.
    Under this standard, ownership interests in subsidiaries held by
    third parties, which are currently referred to as minority
    interests, will be presented as noncontrolling interests and
    shown separately on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within
    equity. In addition, net income (loss) attributable to
    noncontrolling interests will be included in net income on our
    Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). These changes involve
    presentation only, and will not otherwise impact our
    consolidated financial statements. The standard will also affect
    the accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership
    interest, including deconsolidation of a subsidiary. We will
    apply these provisions of SFAS No. 160 prospectively
    to any such transactions.

SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 133

: In March 2008, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 161, effective for us January 1, 2009.
    This standard requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures
    about how and why derivatives are used, how derivatives and
    related hedged items are accounted for under
    SFAS No. 133, and how derivatives and related hedged
    items affect the entity’s financial position, financial
    performance, and cash flows. This standard will not have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

FSP

FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets:

In
    April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 142-3,

effective for us January 1, 2009. This standard amends
    SFAS No. 142 to require expanded consideration of
    expected future renewals or extensions of intangible assets when
    determining their useful lives. This standard will be applied
    prospectively for intangible assets acquired after the effective
    date. This standard will not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

    In Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement):

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB

14-1,

effective for us January 1, 2009

CMS-48


CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

with retrospective application required. This standard will
    apply to our convertible debt securities, and will require us to
    account for the liability and equity components of these
    securities separately and in a manner that will reflect our
    borrowing rate for nonconvertible debt. We expect that the
    retrospective implementation of this standard will result in a
    reduction of Long-term debt of approximately $22 million,
    an increase in Current deferred income tax liabilities of
    approximately $3 million, an increase of Non-current
    deferred income tax liabilities of $6 million, an increase
    of Other paid-in capital of approximately $37 million, and
    an increase of Accumulated deficit of approximately
    $24 million as of January 1, 2009. We further expect
    that the implementation of this standard will increase reported
    interest expense, net of taxes, by approximately $4 million
    in 2009. For additional details on our convertible debt
    instruments, see Note 5, Financings and Capitalization.

FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment
    Transactions Are Participating Securities:

In June 2008, the
    FASB issued FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

effective for us January 1, 2009 with retrospective
    application required. Under this standard, share-based payment
    awards that accrue cash dividends when common shareholders
    receive dividends are considered participating securities if the
    dividends do not need to be returned to the company when the
    employee forfeits the award. This standard will apply to our
    outstanding unvested restricted stock awards, which will be
    considered participating securities and thus will be included in
    the computation of basic EPS. Had this standard been in place in
    2008, it would have reduced 2008 basic and diluted EPS by
    approximately $0.01. We consider this figure to be
    representative of the potential impact of this standard on
    future years’ EPS.

EITF Issue

07-5,

Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock:

In June 2008, the
    FASB ratified EITF Issue

07-5,

effective for us January 1, 2009. This standard establishes
    criteria for determining whether freestanding instruments or
    embedded features are considered “indexed to an
    entity’s own stock” for the purpose of assessing
    potential derivative accounting or balance sheet classification
    issues. The standard applies to all outstanding instruments at
    January 1, 2009, with any transition impacts recognized as
    a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of
    retained earnings. This guidance applies to the equity
    conversion features in our contingently convertible senior notes
    and preferred stock. These conversion features have been
    exempted from derivative accounting because they are indexed to
    our own stock and would be classified in stockholders’
    equity. These features are still considered indexed to our own
    stock under this new guidance, and thus, this standard will have
    no impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Issuer’s Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
    with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement:

In September 2008,
    the FASB ratified EITF Issue

08-5,

effective for us January 1, 2009. This guidance concludes
    that the fair value measurement of a liability should not
    consider the effect of a third-party credit enhancement or
    guarantee supporting the liability. The fair value of the
    liability should thus reflect the credit standing of the issuer
    and should not be adjusted to reflect the credit standing of a
    third-party guarantor. The standard is to be applied
    prospectively. This standard will not have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

FSP FAS 132(R)-1, Employers’ Disclosures about
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets:

In December 2008, the
    FASB issued this standard, effective for us for the year ending
    December 31, 2009. The standard requires expanded annual
    disclosures about the plan assets in our defined benefit pension
    and OPEB plans. The required disclosures include information
    about investment allocation decisions, major categories of plan
    assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used in the fair
    value measurements, the effects of significant unobservable
    inputs on changes in plan assets, and significant concentrations
    of risk within plan assets. The standard involves disclosures
    only, and will not impact our consolidated income, cash flows,
    or financial position.

2: FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

SFAS No. 157, which became effective January 1,
    2008, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. It does not require any new fair value
    measurements, but applies to those fair value measurements
    recorded or disclosed under other accounting

CMS-49


CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

standards. The standard defines fair value as the price that
    would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly exchange between market participants,
    and requires that fair value measurements incorporate all
    assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
    asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. The
    standard also eliminates the prohibition against recognizing
    “day one” gains and losses on derivative instruments.
    We did not hold any derivatives with “day one” gains
    or losses during the year ended December 31, 2008. The
    standard is to be applied prospectively, except that limited
    retrospective application is required for three types of
    financial instruments, none of which we held during the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    prioritizes inputs used to measure fair value according to their
    observability in the market. The three levels of the fair value
    hierarchy are as follows:

•

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities. These markets must
    be accessible to us at the measurement date.

•

Level 2 inputs are observable, market-based inputs, other
    than Level 1 prices. Level 2 inputs may include quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
    quoted prices in inactive markets, interest rates and yield
    curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, credit risks,
    default rates, and inputs derived from or corroborated by
    observable market data.

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect our own
    assumptions about how market participants would value our assets
    and liabilities.

To the extent possible, we use quoted market prices or other
    observable market pricing data in valuing assets and liabilities
    measured at fair value under SFAS No. 157. If this
    information is unavailable, we use market-corroborated data or
    reasonable estimates about market participant assumptions. We
    classify fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy
    based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
    fair value measurement in its entirety.

The FASB issued a one-year deferral of SFAS No. 157
    for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are
    recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. Under
    this partial deferral, SFAS No. 157 became effective
    on January 1, 2009 for fair value measurements in the
    following areas:

•

AROs,

•

most of the nonfinancial assets and liabilities acquired in a
    business combination, and

•

impairment analyses performed for nonfinancial assets.

SFAS No. 157 was effective January 1, 2008 for
    our derivative instruments, available-for-sale investment
    securities, nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets and
    liabilities, and financial instruments disclosed in Note 7,
    Financial and Derivative Instruments, “Financial
    Instruments.” SFAS No. 157 also applied to the
    year-end measurement of fair values of our pension and OPEB plan
    assets. For details on the accounting of our pension and OPEB
    plans, see Note 8, Retirement Benefits. The implementation
    of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial statements.

SEC and FASB Guidance on Fair Value Measurements:

On
    September 30, 2008, in response to concerns about fair
    value accounting and its possible role in the recent declines in
    the financial markets, the SEC Office of the Chief Accountant
    and the FASB staff jointly released additional guidance on fair
    value measurements. The guidance, which was effective for us
    upon issuance, did not change or conflict with the fair value
    principles in SFAS No. 157, but rather provided
    further clarification on how to value a financial asset in an
    illiquid market. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active

. The standard is
    consistent with the joint guidance issued by the SEC and the
    FASB and was effective for us for the quarter ended
    September 30, 2008. The standard was to be applied
    prospectively. The guidance in this standard and the joint
    guidance provided by the FASB and the SEC did not affect our
    fair value measurements.

Cash Equivalents:

Our cash equivalents consist of
    money market funds with daily liquidity. The funds invest in
    U.S. Treasury notes, other government-backed securities,
    and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury
    notes.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Assets:

Our
    nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets are invested in
    various mutual funds. We value these assets using a market
    approach, which uses the daily quoted NAV provided by the fund
    managers that are the basis for transactions to buy or sell
    shares in each fund. On our Consolidated Balance Sheets, these
    assets are included in Other non-current assets.

SERP Assets:

Our SERP assets are valued using a
    market approach, which incorporates prices and other relevant
    information from market transactions. Our SERP equity securities
    consist of an investment in a Standard & Poor’s
    500 Index mutual fund. The fund’s securities are listed on
    an active exchange or dealer market. The fair value of the SERP
    equity securities is based on the NAV of the mutual fund that is
    derived from the daily closing prices of

CMS-51


CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

the equity securities held by the fund. The NAV is the basis for
    transactions to buy or sell shares in the fund. Our SERP debt
    securities, which are investment grade municipal bonds, are
    valued using a market approach, which is based on a matrix
    pricing model that incorporates market-based information. The
    fair value of our SERP debt securities is derived from various
    observable inputs, including benchmark yields, reported
    securities trades, broker/dealer quotes, bond ratings, and
    general information on market movements for investment grade
    municipal securities normally considered by market participants
    when pricing a debt security. SERP assets are included in Other
    non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For
    additional details about our SERP securities, see Note 7,
    Financial and Derivative Instruments.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
    Liabilities:

The non-qualified deferred compensation
    plan liabilities are valued based on the fair values of the plan
    assets, as they reflect what is owed to the plan participants in
    accordance with their investment elections. These liabilities,
    except for our primary DSSP plan liability, are included in
    Other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. Our primary DSSP plan liability is included in
    Non-current postretirement benefits on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

Derivative Instruments:

Our derivative instruments
    are valued using either a market approach that incorporates
    information from market transactions, or an income approach that
    discounts future expected cash flows to a present value amount.
    We use various inputs to value our derivatives depending on the
    type of contract and the availability of market data. We have
    exchange-traded derivative contracts that are valued based on
    Level 1 quoted prices in actively traded markets. We also
    have derivatives that are valued using Level 2 inputs,
    including commodity market prices, interest rates, credit
    ratings, default rates, and market-based seasonality factors.
    For derivative instruments that extend beyond time periods in
    which quoted prices are available, we use modeling methods to
    project future prices. These fair value measurements are
    classified in Level 3 unless modeling was required only for
    an insignificant portion of the total derivative value.

CMS ERM’s non-trading contracts include an electricity
    sales agreement that extends beyond the term for which quoted
    electricity prices are available and which is classified as
    Level 3. To value this agreement, we use a proprietary
    forward power pricing curve that is based on forward gas prices
    and an implied heat rate. We also increased the fair value of
    the liability for this agreement by an amount that reflects the
    uncertainty of our model.

For all fair values other than Level 1 prices, we
    incorporate adjustments for the risk of nonperformance. For our
    derivative assets, we apply a credit adjustment against the
    asset based on the published default rate for the
    counterparty’s assigned credit rating. These credit ratings
    are assigned to each counterparty based on an internal
    credit-scoring model that considers various inputs, including
    the counterparty’s financial statements, credit reports,
    trade press, and other information that would be available to
    market participants. We compare the results of our
    credit-scoring model to credit ratings published by independent
    rating agencies. To the extent that our internal ratings are
    comparable to those obtained from the independent agencies, we
    classify the resulting credit adjustment within Level 2. If
    our internal model results in a rating that is outside of the
    range of ratings given by the independent agencies, the credit
    adjustment would be classified as a Level 3 input, and, if
    significant to the overall valuation, would cause the entire
    fair value to be classified as Level 3. We also adjust our
    derivative liabilities downward to reflect our own risk of
    nonperformance, based on the published credit ratings for our
    company. Adjustments for credit risk using the approach outlined
    above are not materially different than the adjustments that
    would result from using credit default swap rates for the
    contracts we currently hold. For details about our derivative
    contracts, see Note 7, Financial and Derivative Instruments.

Interest Rate Collar:

Grayling Generating Station
    Limited Partnership executed an interest rate collar contract as
    an economic hedge of the variable interest rate charged on its
    outstanding revenue bonds. This interest rate collar was valued
    using an income approach that incorporated forward interest
    rates and a consideration of appropriate credit risk in
    discounting projected cashflows. Due to the use of unobservable
    assumptions in the credit risk component, we have classified the
    fair value of this contract as Level 3. We record the fair
    value of this derivative in Other non-current liabilities on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information on our
    interest rate collar, see Note 7, Financial and Derivative
    Instruments, “Derivative Instruments.”

Foreign Exchange Forward:

We executed this foreign
    exchange forward contract as an economic hedge of an exposure to
    the Moroccan dirham/US dollar exchange rate. This contract was
    valued using an income approach that incorporated forward
    exchange rates and a consideration of appropriate credit risk in
    discounting projected cashflows. We recorded the fair value of
    this derivative in Other current liabilities on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets at December 31, 2008. For additional
    information on our foreign exchange forward, see Note 7,
    Financial and Derivative Instruments, “Derivative
    Instruments.”

Fixed Price Fuel Contracts:

Under certain fixed
    price fuel contracts, we have effectively locked in a price per
    gallon for gasoline and diesel fuel we will purchase from
    January 2009 through November 2009. These contracts are valued
    using an income approach that incorporated forward national fuel
    prices adjusted to reflect conditions in Michigan. The fair
    values of these contracts are included in Other current
    liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional
    information on our fixed fuel price contracts, see Note 7,
    Financial and Derivative Instruments, “Derivative
    Instruments.”

Asset
    Sales

The impacts of our asset sales are included in Gain on asset
    sales, net and Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Asset sales were
    immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2008.

In connection with the sale of our Argentine and Michigan assets
    to Lucid Energy in March 2007, we entered into agreements that
    granted MEI, an affiliate of Lucid Energy, the right to any
    proceeds from an assignment of the ICSID award associated with
    TGN, as well as an option to purchase CMS Gas
    Transmission’s ownership interests in TGN, and the rights
    to any proceeds Enterprises will receive if it sells its stock
    interest in CMS Generation San Nicolas Company.

In June 2008, we executed an agreement with MEI and a
    third-party to assign the ICSID award and to sell our interests
    in TGN directly to the third-party. In accordance with the
    agreements executed in March 2007, the proceeds from the
    assignment of the ICSID award and the sale of TGN were passed on
    to MEI and we recognized an $8 million gain on the
    assignment of the ICSID award in Gain on asset sales, net in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). We also recognized a
    $197 million cumulative net foreign currency translation
    loss related to TGN,

which had been deferred as a Foreign Currency Translation
    component of stockholders’ equity. This charge was fully
    offset by the elimination of a $197 million Argentine
    currency impairment reserve on our Consolidated Balance Sheets,
    created when we impaired our investment in TGN in March 2007.
    For additional details, see “Impairment Charges”
    within this Note.

As of December 31, 2008, $7 million remains as a
    deferred credit on our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to
    MEI’s right to proceeds that Enterprises will receive if it
    sells its stock interest in CMS Generation San Nicolas

(a)

In November 2006, we sold all of our interests in the
    Consumers’ subsidiaries that held the MCV Partnership and
    the MCV Facility to an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners and
    Rockland Capital Energy Investments.

Because of the MCV PPA, the transaction is a sale and leaseback
    for accounting purposes. We have continuing involvement with the
    MCV Partnership through an existing guarantee associated with
    the future operations of the MCV Facility. As a result, we
    accounted for the MCV Facility as a financing for accounting
    purposes and not a sale. The value of the finance obligation was
    based on an allocation of the transaction proceeds to the fair
    values of the net assets sold and fair value of the MCV Facility
    under the financing. The total proceeds were less than the fair
    value of the net assets sold. As a result, there were no
    proceeds remaining to allocate to the MCV Facility; therefore,
    we recorded no finance obligation.

The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of
    $41 million, which includes a reclassification of
    $30 million of AOCI into earnings, an $80 million
    impairment charge on the MCV Facility, an $8 million gain
    on the removal of our interests in the MCV Partnership and the
    MCV Facility, and $1 million benefit in general taxes. Upon
    the sale of our interests in the MCV Partnership and the FMLP,
    we were no longer the primary beneficiary of these entities and
    the entities were deconsolidated.

Discontinued operations include a provision for closing costs
    and a portion of CMS Energy’s parent company interest

    Energy Contingencies

Gas Index Price Reporting Investigation:

We notified
    appropriate regulatory and governmental agencies that some
    employees at CMS MST and CMS Field Services appeared to have
    provided inaccurate information regarding natural gas trades to
    various energy industry publications, which compile and report
    index prices. We cooperated with an investigation by the DOJ
    regarding this matter. Although we have not received any formal
    notification that the DOJ has completed its investigation, the
    DOJ’s last request for information occurred in November
    2003, and we completed our response to this request in May 2004.
    We are unable to predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation
    and what effect, if any, the investigation will have on our
    business.

Gas Index Price Reporting Litigation:

We, along with
    CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas, Inc. (the
    company that purchased CMS Field Services) and Cantera Gas
    Company are named as defendants in

NOTES TO

various lawsuits arising as a result of allegedly inaccurate
    natural gas price reporting. Allegations include manipulation of
    NYMEX natural gas futures and options prices, price-fixing
    conspiracies, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail
    prices in California, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and
    Wisconsin. In June 2007, CMS MST settled a master class action
    suit in California state court for $7 million. In September
    2007, the CMS Energy defendants also settled four class action
    suits originally filed in California federal court. There were
    two recent dismissals of the CMS Energy defendants: Missouri
    Public Service Commission, state court on January 13, 2009,
    and Breckenridge, federal court on January 8, 2009. On
    February 23, 2009, the court also granted CMS Energy’s
    motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Appeals are expected
    in both cases. The other cases in several jurisdictions remain
    pending. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    these matters.

Bay Harbor:

As part of the development of Bay Harbor
    by certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy, pursuant to an agreement
    with the MDEQ, third parties constructed a golf course and park
    over several abandoned CKD piles, left over from the former
    cement plant operations on the Bay Harbor site. The third
    parties also undertook a series of remedial actions, including
    removing abandoned buildings and equipment; consolidating,
    shaping and covering CKD piles with soil and vegetation;
    removing CKD from streams and beaches; and constructing a
    leachate collection system at an identified seep. Leachate is
    formed when water passes through CKD. In 2002, CMS Energy sold
    its interest in Bay Harbor, but retained its obligations under
    environmental indemnifications entered into at the start of the
    project.

In 2005, the EPA along with CMS Land and CMS Capital voluntarily
    executed an AOC under Superfund and approved a Removal Action
    Work Plan to address issues at Bay Harbor. Collection systems
    required under the plan have been installed and shoreline
    monitoring is ongoing. In February 2008, CMS Land and CMS
    Capital submitted a proposed augmentation plan to the EPA to
    address areas where pH measurements are not satisfactory. CMS
    Land, CMS Capital and the EPA have agreed upon the augmentation
    measures and a schedule for their installation. The augmentation
    measures are being implemented and are anticipated to be
    completed in 2009.

In February 2008, the MDEQ and the EPA granted permits for CMS
    Land or its affiliate, Beeland, to construct and operate a deep
    injection well near Alba, Michigan in eastern Antrim County.
    Certain environmental groups, a local township, and a local
    county filed an appeal of the EPA’s decision and following
    denial by the MDEQ of a right to a hearing, filed lawsuits in
    the Ingham Circuit Court appealing the permits. The EPA has
    denied the appeal. One appeal relating to the state permit
    remains pending in the state court. Groups opposed to the
    injection well filed a lawsuit in Antrim County seeking an
    injunction against development of the well. In January 2009, the
    trial judge issued a preliminary injunction. Beeland is
    considering an appeal of the court’s order.

CMS Land and CMS Capital, the MDEQ, the EPA, and other parties
    are having ongoing discussions concerning the long-term remedy
    for the Bay Harbor sites. These discussions are addressing,
    among other things:

•

the disposal of leachate,

•

the capping and excavation of CKD,

•

the location and design of collection lines and upstream
    diversion of water,

•

potential flow of leachate below the collection system,

•

applicable criteria for various substances such as
    mercury, and

•

other matters that are likely to affect the scope of remedial
    work that CMS Land and CMS Capital may be obligated to undertake.

CMS Energy has recorded a cumulative charge, which includes
    accretion expense, related to Bay Harbor of $141 million.
    At December 31, 2008, we have a recorded liability of
    $62 million for our remaining obligations. We calculated
    this liability based on discounted projected costs, using a
    discount rate of 4.45 percent and an inflation rate of one
    percent on annual operating and maintenance costs. We based the
    discount rate on the interest rate for

30-year

U.S. Treasury securities on December 31, 2007, the
    date of the last major revision to our remediation cost

estimate. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is
    $75 million. We expect to pay $21 million in 2009,
    $12 million in 2010, $3 million in 2011, and the
    remaining expenditures as part of long-term liquid disposal and
    operating and maintenance costs. Our estimate of remedial action
    costs and the timing of expenditures could be impacted by any
    significant change in circumstances or assumptions, such as:

•

an increase in the number of problem areas,

•

different remediation techniques,

•

nature and extent of contamination,

•

continued inability to reach agreement with the MDEQ or the EPA
    over required remedial actions,

•

delays in the receipt of requested permits,

•

delays following the receipt of any requested permits due to
    legal appeals of third parties,

•

increase in water disposal costs,

•

delays in developing a long-term water disposal option,

•

additional or new legal or regulatory requirements, or

•

new or different landowner claims.

Depending on the size of any indemnification obligation or
    liability under environmental laws, an adverse outcome of this
    matter could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s
    liquidity and financial condition and could negatively impact
    CMS Energy’s financial results. We cannot predict the
    financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Quicksilver Resources, Inc.:

On November 1, 2001,
    Quicksilver sued CMS MST in Texas state court in
    Fort Worth, Texas for breach of contract in connection with
    a base contract for the sale and purchase of natural gas. The
    contract outlines Quicksilver’s agreement to sell, and CMS
    MST’s agreement to buy, natural gas. Quicksilver believes
    that it is entitled to more payments for natural gas than it has
    received. CMS MST disagrees with Quicksilver’s analysis and
    believes that it has paid all amounts owed for delivery of gas
    according to the contract. Quicksilver sought damages of up to
    approximately $126 million, plus prejudgment interest and
    attorney fees.

The jury verdict awarded Quicksilver no compensatory damages but
    $10 million in punitive damages. The jury found that CMS
    MST breached the contract and committed fraud but found no
    actual damage related to such a claim.

On May 15, 2007, the trial court vacated the jury award of
    punitive damages but held that the contract should be rescinded
    prospectively. The judicial rescission of the contract caused
    CMS Energy to record a charge in the second quarter of 2007 of
    $24 million, net of tax. To preserve its appellate rights,
    CMS MST filed a motion to modify, correct or reform the judgment
    and a motion for a judgment contrary to the jury verdict with
    the trial court. The trial court dismissed these motions. CMS
    MST has filed a notice of appeal with the Texas Court of
    Appeals. Quicksilver has filed a notice of cross appeal. Both
    Quicksilver and CMS MST have filed their opening briefs and
    briefs of cross appeal. Oral arguments were made on
    October 29, 2008. Quicksilver claims that the contract
    should be rescinded from its inception, rather than merely from
    the date of the judgment. Although we believe Quicksilver’s
    position to be without merit, if the court were to grant the
    relief requested by Quicksilver, it could result in a loss of up
    to $10 million.

Cleanup and Solid Waste:

Under the NREPA, we will
    ultimately incur investigation and response activity costs at a
    number of sites. We believe that these costs will be recoverable
    in rates under current ratemaking policies.

We are a potentially responsible party at a number of
    contaminated sites administered under the Superfund. Superfund
    liability is joint and several. However, many other creditworthy
    parties with substantial assets are potentially responsible with
    respect to the individual sites. Based on our experience, we
    estimate that our share of the total liability for most of our
    known Superfund sites will be between $2 million and
    $11 million. A number of factors, including the number of
    potentially responsible parties involved with each site, affect
    our share of the total liability. As of December 31, 2008,
    we have recorded a liability of $2 million, the minimum
    amount of our range of possible outcomes estimated probable
    Superfund liability in accordance with FIN 14.

The timing of payments related to our investigation and response
    activities at our Superfund and NREPA sites is uncertain.
    Periodically, we receive information about new sites, which
    leads us to review our response activity estimates. Any
    significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an
    increase in the number of sites, different remediation
    techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and legal and
    regulatory requirements, could affect our estimates of NREPA and
    Superfund liability.

Ludington PCB:

In October 1998, during routine
    maintenance activities, we identified PCB as a component in
    certain paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington. We
    removed and replaced part of the PCB material with non-PCB
    material. Since proposing a plan to deal with the remaining
    materials, we have had several communications with the EPA. We
    are not able to predict when the EPA will issue a final ruling.
    We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Electric Utility Plant Air Permit Issues:

In April
    2007, we received a NOV/FOV from the EPA alleging that fourteen
    utility boilers exceeded visible emission limits in their
    associated air permits. The utility boilers are located at the
    Karn/Weadock Generating Complex, Campbell Plant, Cobb Electric
    Generating Station and Whiting Plant, which are all in Michigan.
    We have responded formally to the NOV/FOV denying the
    allegations and are awaiting the EPA’s response to our
    submission. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    this matter.

Routine Maintenance Classification:

The EPA has
    alleged that some utilities have incorrectly classified major
    plant modifications as RMRR rather than seeking permits from the
    EPA to modify their plants. We responded to information requests
    from the EPA on this subject in 2000, 2002, and 2006. We believe
    that we have properly interpreted the requirements of RMRR. In
    October 2008, we received another information request from the
    EPA pursuant to Section 114 of the Clean Air Act. We
    responded to this information request in December 2008. In
    addition to the EPA’s information request, in October 2008,
    we received a NOV for three of our coal-based facilities
    relating to violations of NSR regulations, alleging ten projects
    from 1986 to 1998 were subject to NSR review. We met with the
    EPA in January 2009 and have additional meetings scheduled. If
    the EPA does not accept our interpretation of RMRR, we could be
    required to install additional pollution control equipment at
    some or all of our coal-based electric generating plants,
    surrender emission allowances, engage in supplemental
    environmental programs and pay fines. Additionally, we would
    need to assess the viability of continuing operations at certain
    plants. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    this matter.

Clean Air Interstate Rule:

In March 2005, the EPA
    adopted the CAIR, which required additional coal-based electric
    generating plant emission controls for nitrogen oxides and
    sulfur dioxide. The CAIR was appealed to the U.S. Court of
    Appeals for the District of Columbia. The court initially
    vacated the CAIR and the CAIR federal implementation plan in
    their entirety, but subsequently, the court changed course and
    remanded the rule to the EPA maintaining the rule in effect
    pending EPA revision. As a result, the CAIR still remains in
    effect, with the first annual nitrogen oxides compliance year
    beginning January 1, 2009. The EPA must now revise the rule
    to resolve the court’s concerns. The court did not set a
    timetable for the revision. We cannot predict the financial
    impact or outcome of this matter.

Litigation:

Our transmission charges paid to MISO
    have been subject to regulatory review and recovery through the
    annual PSCR process. The Attorney General has argued that the
    statute governing the PSCR process does not permit recovery of
    transmission charges in that manner and those expenses should be
    considered in general rate cases. Several decisions of the
    Michigan Court of Appeals have ruled against the Attorney
    General’s arguments, but in September 2008, the Michigan
    Supreme Court granted the Attorney General’s applications
    for leave to appeal two of those decisions. If the Michigan
    Supreme Court accepts the Attorney General’s position, we
    and other electric utilities will be required to obtain recovery
    of transmission charges through an alternative ratemaking
    mechanism. We expect a decision by the Michigan Supreme Court on
    these appeals by mid-2009. We cannot predict the financial
    impact or outcome of this matter.

    Electric Utility Rate Matters

Stranded Cost Recovery:

In November 2004, the MPSC
    approved recovery of our Stranded Costs incurred in 2002 and
    2003 plus interest through the period of collection through a
    surcharge on ROA customers. Since the MPSC order, we have
    experienced a downward trend in ROA customers, although recently
    this trend has slightly reversed. In October 2008, the Michigan
    legislature enacted legislation that amended the Customer Choice
    Act and directed the MPSC to approve rates that will allow
    recovery of Stranded Costs within five years. In January 2009,
    we filed an application with the MPSC requesting recovery of
    these Stranded Costs through a surcharge on both full service
    and ROA customers. At December 31, 2008, we had a
    regulatory asset for Stranded Costs of $71 million.

Power Supply Costs:

The PSCR process is designed to
    allow us to recover all of our power supply costs if incurred
    under reasonable and prudent policies and practices. The MPSC
    reviews these costs, policies, and practices for prudence in
    annual plan and reconciliation proceedings.

The following table summarizes our PSCR reconciliation filing
    currently pending with the MPSC:

In our 2007 PSCR Plan we expected to offset power supply costs
    by including a $44 million credit for Palisades sale proceeds
    due customers. However, the MPSC directed that the Palisades
    sale proceeds be refunded through bill credits outside of the
    PSCR process.

This amount includes 2006 underrecoveries as allowed by the MPSC
    order in our 2007 PSCR plan case.

2008 PSCR Plan

: In September 2007, we submitted our 2008
    PSCR plan filing to the MPSC. The plan includes recovery of 2007
    PSCR underrecoveries of $42 million. We self-implemented a
    2008 PSCR charge in January 2008. In November 2008, the MPSC
    issued an order approving our PSCR plan factor.

2009 PSCR Plan

: In September 2008, we submitted our 2009
    PSCR plan filing to the MPSC. The plan seeks approval to apply a
    uniform maximum PSCR factor of $0.02680 per kWh for all classes
    of customers. The plan also seeks approval to recover an
    expected $22 million discount in power supply charges
    provided to a large industrial customer. The MPSC approved the
    discount in 2005 to promote long-term investments in the
    industrial infrastructure of Michigan. We self-implemented a
    2009 PSCR charge in January 2009.

While we expect to recover fully all of our PSCR costs, we
    cannot predict the financial impact or the outcome of these
    proceedings. When we are unable to collect these costs as they
    are incurred, there is a negative impact on our cash flows.

Electric Rate Case:

In November 2008, we filed an
    application with the MPSC seeking an annual increase in revenue
    of $214 million based on an 11 percent authorized
    return on equity. The filing seeks recovery of costs associated
    with new plant investments including Clean Air Act investments,
    higher operating and maintenance costs, and the approval to
    recover costs associated with our advanced metering
    infrastructure program. The following table details the

This is the first electric rate case under the new streamlined

    October 2008. The new provisions generally allows utilities to
    self-implement rates six months after filing, subject to refund,
    unless the MPSC finds good cause to prohibit such
    self-implementation. The new provisions require the MPSC to
    issue an order 12 months after filing or the rates, as
    filed, become permanent. We cannot predict the financial impact
    or outcome of this proceeding.

Palisades Regulatory Proceedings:

The MPSC order
    approving the Palisades sale transaction required that we credit
    $255 million of excess sales proceeds and decommissioning
    amounts to our retail customers by December 2008. There are
    additional excess sales proceeds and decommissioning fund
    balances of $135 million above the amount in the MPSC
    order. The MPSC order in our 2007 electric rate case instructed
    us to offset the excess sales proceeds and decommissioning fund
    balances with $26 million of transaction costs from the
    Palisades sale and credit the remaining balance of
    $109 million to customers. The distribution of these funds
    is still pending with the MPSC.

Nuclear Matters:

DOE Litigation:

In
    1997, a U.S. Court of Appeals decision confirmed that the
    DOE was to begin accepting deliveries of spent nuclear fuel for
    disposal by January 1998. Subsequent U.S. Court of Appeals
    litigation, in which we and other utilities participated, has
    not been successful in producing more specific relief for the
    DOE’s failure to accept the spent nuclear fuel.

A number of court decisions support the right of utilities to
    pursue damage claims in the United States Court of Claims
    against the DOE for failure to take delivery of spent nuclear
    fuel. We filed our complaint in December 2002. If our litigation
    against the DOE is successful, we plan to use any recoveries as
    reimbursement for the incurred costs of spent nuclear fuel
    storage during our ownership of Palisades and Big Rock. We
    cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.
    The sale of Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI did not transfer
    the right to any recoveries from the DOE related to costs of
    spent nuclear fuel storage incurred during our ownership of
    Palisades and Big Rock.

Big Rock Decommissioning:

The MPSC and the FERC
    regulate the recovery of costs to decommission Big Rock. In
    December 2000, funding of a Big Rock trust fund ended because
    the MPSC-authorized decommissioning surcharge collection period
    expired. The level of funds provided by the trust fell short of
    the amount needed to complete decommissioning. As a result, we
    provided $44 million of corporate contributions for
    decommissioning costs. This amount is in addition to the
    $30 million payment to Entergy to assume ownership and
    responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI and additional corporate
    contributions for nuclear fuel storage costs of
    $55 million, due to the DOE’s failure to accept spent
    nuclear fuel on schedule. At December 31, 2008, we have a
    $129 million regulatory asset recorded on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets for these costs.

In July 2008, we filed an application with the MPSC seeking the
    deferral of ratemaking treatment for the recovery of our nuclear
    fuel storage costs and the payment to Entergy, until the
    litigation regarding these costs is resolved in the federal
    courts. In the application, we also are seeking to recover the
    $44 million Big Rock decommissioning shortfall from
    customers. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Cost:

We deferred payment for
    disposal of spent nuclear fuel used before April 7, 1983.
    Our DOE liability is $162 million at December 31,
    2008. This amount includes interest, and is payable upon the
    first delivery of spent nuclear fuel to the DOE. We recovered
    the amount of this liability, excluding a portion of interest,
    through electric rates. In conjunction with the sale of
    Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI, we retained this obligation
    and provide a $162 million letter of credit to Entergy as
    security for this obligation.

Consumers’
    Gas Utility Contingencies

Gas Environmental Matters:

We expect to incur
    investigation and remediation costs at a number of sites under
    the NREPA, a Michigan statute that covers environmental
    activities including remediation. These sites include 23 former
    manufactured gas plant facilities. We operated the facilities on
    these sites for some part of their operating lives. For some of
    these sites, we have no current ownership or may own only a
    portion of the original site. In December 2008, we estimated our
    remaining costs to be between $38 million and
    $52 million. We expect to fund most of these costs through
    proceeds from insurance settlements and MPSC-approved rates.

At December 31, 2008, we have a liability of
    $38 million and a regulatory asset of $69 million
    that, includes $31 million of deferred MGP expenditures.
    The timing of payments related to the remediation of our
    manufactured gas plant sites is uncertain. We expect annual
    response activity costs to range between $5 million and
    $6 million over the next five years. Periodically, we
    review these response activity cost estimates. Any significant
    change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the
    number of sites, changes in remediation techniques or legal and
    regulatory requirements, could affect our estimates of annual
    response activity costs and MGP liability.

FERC Investigation:

In February 2008, we received a
    data request relating to an investigation the FERC is conducting
    into possible violations of the FERC’s posting and
    competitive bidding regulations related to releases of firm
    capacity on natural gas pipelines. We responded to the
    FERC’s first data request in the first quarter of 2008. In

July 2008, we responded to a second set of data requests from
    the FERC. The FERC has also taken depositions and made an
    additional data request. We cannot predict the financial impact
    or the outcome of this matter.

Consumers’
    Gas Utility Rate Matters

Gas Cost Recovery:

The GCR process is designed to
    allow us to recover all of our purchased natural gas costs if
    incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.
    The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices for
    prudence in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings.

The following table summarizes our GCR reconciliation filings
    currently pending with the MPSC:

Description of Net Overrecovery

2007-2008

$1.7 billion

The total amount reflects an overrecovery of $15 million plus $2
    million in accrued interest owed to customers.

GCR plan for year

2008-2009:

In
    February 2009, the MPSC issued an order for our

2008-2009

GCR plan year. The order approved a base GCR ceiling factor of
    $8.17 per mcf for April 2008 through March 2009, subject to a
    quarterly ceiling price adjustment mechanism.

Due to an increase in NYMEX gas prices, the base GCR ceiling
    factor increased to $9.52 per mcf for the three-month period of
    April through June 2008 and to $9.92 for the three-month period
    of July through September 2008, pursuant to the quarterly
    ceiling price adjustment mechanism. Beginning in October 2008,
    the base GCR ceiling factor was adjusted to $8.17 due to a
    decrease in NYMEX gas prices.

The GCR billing factor is adjusted monthly in order to minimize
    the over or underrecovery amounts in our annual GCR
    reconciliation. Our GCR billing factor for March 2009 is $8.17
    per mcf. We are currently anticipating an underrecovery will
    occur during the

2008-2009

GCR year.

GCR plan for year

2009-2010:

In
    December 2008, we filed an application with the MPSC seeking
    approval of a GCR plan for our

2009-2010

GCR plan year. Our request proposed the use of a base GCR
    ceiling factor of $8.10 per mcf, plus a quarterly GCR ceiling
    price adjustment contingent upon future events. We expect to
    self-implement a 2009 GCR charge in April 2009.

While we expect to recover fully all of our GCR costs, we cannot
    predict the financial impact or the outcome of these
    proceedings. When we are unable to collect GCR costs as they are
    incurred, there is a negative impact on our cash flows.

Gas Depreciation:

On August 1, 2008, we filed a
    gas depreciation case using 2007 data with the MPSC-ordered
    variations on traditional cost-of-removal methodologies. In
    December 2008, the MPSC approved a partial settlement agreement
    allowing us to implement the filed depreciation rates, on an
    interim basis, concurrent with the implementation of settled
    rates in our 2008 gas rate case. The interim depreciation rates
    reduce our depreciation expense by approximately
    $20 million per year and will remain in effect until a
    final order is issued in our gas depreciation case. If a final
    order in our gas depreciation case is not issued concurrently
    with a final order in a general gas rate case, the MPSC may
    incorporate the results of the depreciation case into general
    gas rates through a surcharge, which may be either positive or
    negative.

2008 Gas Rate Case:

In December 2008, the MPSC approved a
    settlement agreement authorizing a rate increase of
    $22 million, based on a 10.55 percent authorized
    return on equity, for service rendered on and after
    December 24, 2008. The settlement includes a
    $20 million decrease in depreciation rates and requires
    that we not request a new gas general rate increase prior to
    May 1, 2009.

Other
    Contingencies — Indemnifications

Equatorial Guinea Tax Claim:

In 2004, we received a
    request for indemnification from the purchaser of CMS Oil and
    Gas. The indemnification claim relates to the sale of our oil,
    gas and methanol projects in Equatorial Guinea and the claim of
    the government of Equatorial Guinea that we owe
    $142 million in taxes in connection with that sale. CMS
    Energy concluded that the government’s tax claim is without
    merit and the purchaser of CMS Oil and Gas submitted a response
    to the government rejecting the claim. The government of
    Equatorial Guinea has indicated that it still intends to pursue
    its claim. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    this matter.

Moroccan Tax Claim:

In May 2007, we sold our
    50 percent interest in Jorf Lasfar. As part of the sale
    agreement, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for
    50 percent of any tax assessments on Jorf Lasfar
    attributable to tax years prior to the sale. In December 2007,
    the Moroccan tax authority concluded its audit of Jorf Lasfar
    for tax years 2003 through 2005. The audit asserted deficiencies
    in certain corporate and withholding taxes. In January 2009, we
    paid $18 million, which was charged against a tax
    indemnification liability established when we recorded the sale
    of Jorf Lasfar, and accordingly it did not affect earnings.

Marathon Indemnity Claim regarding F.T. Barr Claim:

On
    December 3, 2001, F. T. Barr, an individual with an
    overriding royalty interest in production from the Alba field,
    filed a lawsuit in Harris County District Court in Texas against
    CMS Energy, CMS Oil and Gas and other defendants alleging that
    his overriding royalty payments related to Alba field production
    were improperly calculated. CMS Oil and Gas believes that Barr
    was paid properly on gas sales and that he was not entitled to
    the additional overriding royalty payment sought. All parties
    signed a confidential settlement agreement on April 26,
    2004. The settlement resolved claims between Barr and the
    defendants, and the involved CMS Energy entities reserved all
    defenses to any indemnity claim relating to the settlement.
    There is disagreement between Marathon and certain current or
    former CMS Energy entities as to the existence and scope of any
    indemnity obligations to Marathon in connection with the
    settlement. Between April 2005 and April 2008, there were no
    further communications between Marathon and CMS Energy entities
    regarding this matter. In April 2008, Marathon indicated its
    intent to pursue the indemnity claim. Present and former CMS
    Energy entities and Marathon entered into an agreement tolling
    the statute of limitations on any claim by Marathon under the
    indemnity. CMS Energy entities dispute Marathon’s claim,
    and will vigorously oppose it if raised in any legal proceeding.
    CMS Energy entities also will assert that Marathon has suffered
    minimal, if any, damages. CMS Energy cannot predict the outcome
    of this matter. If Marathon’s claim were sustained, it
    would have a material effect on CMS Energy’s future
    earnings and cash flow.

Guarantees and Indemnifications:

FIN 45
    requires a guarantor, upon issuance of a guarantee, to recognize
    a liability for the fair value of the obligation it undertakes
    in issuing the guarantee. To measure the fair value of a
    guarantee liability, we recognize a liability for any premium
    received or receivable in exchange for the guarantee. For a
    guarantee issued as part of a larger transaction, such as in
    association with an asset sale or executory contract, we
    recognize a liability for any premium that we would have
    received had we issued the guarantee as a single item.

The Michigan Strategic Fund is housed within the Michigan
    Department of Treasury to provide public and private development
    finance opportunities for agriculture, forestry, business,
    industry and communities within the State of Michigan.

First Mortgage Bonds:

Consumers secures its FMB by a
    mortgage and lien on substantially all of its property.
    Consumers’ ability to issue FMB is restricted by certain
    provisions in the First Mortgage Bond Indenture and the need for
    regulatory approvals under federal law. Restrictive issuance
    provisions in the First Mortgage Bond Indenture include
    achieving a two-times interest coverage ratio and having
    sufficient unfunded net property additions.

Regulatory Authorization for Financings:

The FERC
    has authorized Consumers to have outstanding at any one time, up
    to $1.0 billion of secured and unsecured short-term
    securities for general corporate purposes. The remaining
    availability is $550 million at December 31, 2008.

The FERC has also authorized Consumers to issue and sell up to
    $1.5 billion of secured and unsecured long-term securities
    for general corporate purposes. The remaining availability is
    $950 million at December 31, 2008.

The authorizations are for the period ending June 30, 2010.
    Any long-term issuances during the authorization period are
    exempt from the FERC’s competitive bidding and negotiated
    placement requirements.

Securitization Bonds:

Certain regulatory assets
    collateralize securitization bonds. The bondholders have no
    recourse to our other assets. Through Consumers’ rate
    structure, we bill customers for securitization surcharges to
    fund the payment of principal, interest, and other related
    expenses. The surcharges collected are remitted to a trustee and
    are not available to creditors of Consumers or creditors of
    Consumers’ affiliates. Securitization surcharges totaled
    $53 million in 2008 and $48 million in 2007.

Long-Term Debt — Related Parties:

CMS
    Energy formed a statutory wholly owned business trust for the
    sole purpose of issuing preferred securities and lending the
    gross proceeds to itself. The sole assets of the trust consists
    of the debentures described in the following table. These
    debentures have terms similar to those of the mandatorily
    redeemable preferred securities the trust issued. We determined
    that we do not hold the controlling financial interest in our
    trust preferred security structure. Accordingly, this entity is
    reflected in Long-term debt — related parties on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Dividend Restrictions:

Under provisions of our
    senior notes indenture, at December 31, 2008, payment of
    common stock dividends was limited to $585 million.

Under the provisions of its articles of incorporation, at
    December 31, 2008, Consumers had $331 million of
    unrestricted retained earnings available to pay common stock
    dividends. Provisions of the Federal Power Act and the Natural
    Gas Act appear to restrict dividends to the amount of
    Consumers’ retained earnings. Several decisions from the
    FERC suggest that under a variety of circumstances common stock
    dividends from Consumers would not be limited to amounts in
    Consumers’ retained earnings. Decisions in those
    circumstances would, however, be based on specific facts and
    circumstances and would result only after a formal regulatory
    filing process.

During 2008, CMS Energy received $297 million of common
    stock dividends from Consumers.

Sale of Accounts Receivable:

Under a revolving
    accounts receivable sales program, we sell eligible accounts
    receivable to a wholly owned, consolidated, bankruptcy-remote
    special-purpose entity. In turn, the special purpose entity may
    sell an undivided interest in up to $250 million of the
    receivables at December 31, 2008, reduced from
    $325 million at December 31, 2007. The special purpose
    entity sold $170 million in receivables at
    December 31, 2008 and no receivables at December 31,
    2007. The purchaser of the receivables has no recourse against
    our other assets for failure of a debtor to pay when due and no
    right to any receivables not sold. We have neither recorded a
    gain or loss on the receivables sold nor retained any interest
    in the receivables sold. We continue to service the receivables
    sold to the special-purpose entity.

We have the right to require the 4.50 percent preferred

    remains at or above $12.37 for 20 of any 30 consecutive trading
    days. The holders of the 3.375 percent senior notes have
    the right to require us to purchase the notes at par on
    July 15, 2013 and 2018. The holders of the
    2.875 percent senior notes have the right to require us to
    purchase the notes at par on December 1, 2011, 2014, and
    2019.

The securities become convertible for a calendar quarter if the
    price of our common stock remains at or above the trigger price
    for 20 of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the previous quarter. The trigger price at which these
    securities become convertible is 120 percent of the
    conversion price. The conversion and trigger prices are subject
    to adjustment under certain circumstances, including payments or
    distributions to our common stockholders. The conversion and
    trigger price adjustment is made when the cumulative change in
    conversion and trigger prices is one percent or more.

All of our contingently convertible securities, if converted,
    require us to pay cash up to the principal (or par) amount of
    the securities. Any conversion value in excess of that amount is
    paid in shares of our common stock.

During December 2008, no trigger price contingencies were met.

    for conversion. The conversion at $13.41 per share resulted in
    the issuance of 213,742 shares of common stock and payment
    of $10 million.

In December 2008, $6 million of 4.50 percent preferred
    stock was tendered for conversion. The conversion price
    determined in January 2009 was $10.92 per share. The conversion

Contingently Convertible Securities:

When we
    have positive income from continuing operations, our
    contingently convertible securities dilute EPS to the extent
    that the conversion value, which is based on the average market
    price of our common stock, exceeds the principal or par value.
    Had there been positive income from continuing operations, our
    contingently convertible securities would have contributed an
    additional 19.7 million shares to the calculation of
    diluted EPS for 2007, and 11.3 million shares for 2006. For
    additional details on our contingently convertible securities,
    see Note 5, Financings and Capitalization.

Stock Options, Warrants and Restricted Stock
    Awards:

For the year ended December 31,
    2008, outstanding options and warrants to purchase
    0.6 million shares of common stock had no impact on diluted
    EPS, since the exercise price was greater than the average
    market price of common stock. These stock options have the
    potential to dilute EPS in the future. Had there been positive
    income from continuing operations, 1.1 million shares of
    unvested restricted stock awards and options and warrants to
    purchase 0.3 million shares of common stock would have been
    included in the calculation of diluted EPS for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. For the year ended December 31,
    2006, had there been positive income from continuing operations,
    1.0 million shares of unvested restricted stock awards and
    options and warrants to purchase 0.5 million shares of
    common stock would have been included in the calculation of
    diluted EPS.

Convertible Debentures:

For the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, there was no impact on
    diluted EPS from our 7.75 percent convertible subordinated
    debentures. Using the if-converted method, the debentures would
    have:

•

increased the numerator of diluted EPS by $9 million from
    an assumed reduction of interest expense, net of tax, and

•

increased the denominator of diluted EPS by 4.2 million
    shares.

We can revoke the conversion rights if certain conditions are
    met.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

effective for us January 1, 2009 with retrospective
    application required. Under this standard, share-based payment
    awards that accrue cash dividends when common shareholders
    receive dividends are considered participating securities if the
    dividends do not need to be returned to the company when the
    employee forfeits the award. This standard will apply to our
    outstanding unvested restricted stock awards, which will be
    considered participating securities and thus will be included in
    the computation of basic EPS. Had this standard been in place in
    2008, it would have reduced 2008 basic and diluted EPS by
    approximately $0.01. We consider this figure to be
    representative of the potential impact of this standard on
    future years’ EPS.

7: FINANCIAL
    AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Financial Instruments:

The carrying amounts of cash,
    current accounts and notes receivable, short-term investments,
    and current liabilities approximate their fair values because of
    their short-term nature. We estimate the fair values of
    long-term financial instruments based on quoted market prices
    or, in the absence of specific market prices, on quoted market
    prices of similar instruments or other valuation techniques.

Equity securities classified as available for sale consist of an
    investment in a Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
    mutual fund. Debt securities classified as available for sale
    consist of investment-grade municipal bonds. Debt securities
    classified as held to maturity consist of municipal bonds and
    mortgage-backed securities held by EnerBank.

During 2008, the fair value of our SERP investment in equity
    securities declined to $39 million. We determined that this
    decline in fair value was other than temporary. Accordingly, we
    reclassified net unrealized losses of $24 million
    ($15 million, net of tax) from AOCL to Other expense in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and established a new
    cost basis of $39 million for these investments, which was
    equal to fair value at December 31, 2008.

The fair value of debt securities by contractual maturity at
    December 31, 2008 is as follows:

During 2008, the proceeds from sales of SERP securities were
    $2 million. Gross losses realized were immaterial. During
    2007, the proceeds from sales of SERP securities were
    $64 million, and $23 million of gross gains and
    $1 million of gross losses were realized. We reclassified
    net gains of $15 million, net of tax of $7 million,
    from AOCL and included this amount in net loss in 2007. The
    proceeds from sales of SERP securities were $6 million
    during 2006. Gross gains and losses were immaterial in 2006.

Derivative Instruments:

In order to limit our
    exposure to certain market risks, primarily changes in interest
    rates, commodity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates, we
    may enter into various risk management contracts, such as swaps,
    options, futures, and forward contracts. We enter into these
    contracts using established policies and procedures, under the
    direction of an executive oversight committee consisting of
    senior management representatives and a risk committee
    consisting of business unit managers.

The contracts we use to manage market risks may qualify as
    derivative instruments that are subject to derivative accounting
    under SFAS No. 133. If a contract is a derivative and
    does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception
    under SFAS No. 133, we record it on our consolidated
    balance sheet at its fair value. Each quarter, we adjust the
    resulting asset or liability to reflect any change in the fair
    value of the contract, a practice known as marking the contract
    to market. Since we have not designated any of our derivatives
    as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133, we report all
    mark-to-market gains and losses in earnings. For a discussion of
    how we determine the fair value of our derivatives, see
    Note 2, Fair Value Measurements.

Most of our commodity purchase and sale contracts are not
    subject to derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133
    because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units
    specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity
    or bcf of natural gas),

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales
    exception, or

•

there is not an active market for the commodity.

Our coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is
    not an active market for the coal we purchase. If an active
    market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts
    may qualify as derivatives. For Consumers, which is subject to
    regulatory accounting, the resulting mark-to-market gains and
    losses would be

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO

offset by changes in regulatory assets and liabilities and would
    not affect net income. For other CMS Energy subsidiaries, we do
    not believe the resulting mark-to-market impact on earnings
    would be material.

Interest Rate Collar:

Grayling Generating
    Station Limited Partnership executed this interest rate collar
    contract as an economic hedge of the variable interest rate
    charged on its outstanding revenue bonds. We record the fair
    value of this derivative in Other non-current liabilities on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recorded the mark-to-market loss
    on this derivative in Other expense on our Consolidated
    Statements of Income (Loss).

Fixed Price Fuel Contracts:

Consumers entered
    into two financial contracts to fix economically the price of
    gasoline and diesel fuel it purchases for its fleet vehicles and
    equipment. Under these agreements, Consumers has effectively
    locked in a price per gallon for gasoline and diesel fuel it
    will purchase from January through November 2009. We record the
    fair value of these derivatives in Other current liabilities on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recorded the mark-to-market
    losses on these derivatives in Other expense on our Consolidated
    Statements of Income (Loss).

Electricity and Gas Contracts:

In order to
    support CMS Energy’s ongoing non-utility operations, CMS
    ERM enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity and
    natural gas in the future. These forward contracts are generally
    long-term in nature and result in physical delivery of the
    commodity at a contracted price. To manage commodity price risks
    associated with these forward purchase and sale contracts, CMS
    ERM also uses various financial instruments, such as swaps,
    options, and futures.

In the past, CMS ERM generally classified all of its derivatives
    that result in physical delivery of commodities as non-trading
    contracts and all of its derivatives that financially settle as
    trading contracts. Following the restructuring of our DIG
    investment and the resulting streamlining of CMS ERM’s risk
    management activities in the first quarter of 2008, we
    reevaluated the classification of CMS ERM’s derivatives as
    trading versus non-trading. We determined that all of CMS
    ERM’s derivatives are held for purposes other than trading.
    Therefore, during 2008, we have classified all of CMS ERM’s
    derivatives as non-trading derivatives.

We record the fair value of these contracts in Other current and
    non-current assets or Other current and non-current liabilities
    on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For contracts that
    economically hedge sales of power or gas to third parties, CMS
    ERM records mark-to-market gains and losses in earnings as a
    component of Operating Revenue. For contracts that economically
    hedge purchases of power or gas, CMS ERM records mark-to-market
    gains and losses in earnings as a component of Operating
    Expenses.

On January 1, 2008, we implemented FSP

FIN 39-1,

which permits entities to offset the fair value of derivatives
    held under master netting arrangements with cash collateral
    received or paid for those derivatives. We have made an
    accounting policy choice to offset the fair value of our
    derivatives held under master netting arrangements. Therefore,
    as a result of adopting this standard, we also offset related
    cash collateral amounts, which resulted in a reduction to both
    CMS ERM’s derivative-related assets and liabilities of
    $2 million at December 31, 2008 and $4 million at
    December 31, 2007.

Foreign Exchange Forward:

We executed this
    foreign exchange forward contract as an economic hedge of an
    exposure to the Moroccan dirham/US dollar exchange rate. This
    exposure resulted from a tax indemnification, under which we
    agreed to pay an amount equal to 150 million Moroccan
    dirhams (approximately $18 million) to the

CMS-75


CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

purchaser of our previous interest in Jorf Lasfar. We settled
    this obligation and the related derivative in January 2009. We
    recorded the fair value of this derivative in Other current
    liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at
    December 31, 2008. We recorded the mark-to-market loss on
    this derivative in Other expense on our Consolidated Statements
    of Income (Loss). For further details on the related tax
    indemnification, see Note 4, Contingencies, “Other
    Contingencies — Indemnifications — Moroccan
    Tax Claim.”

Credit Risk:

Our swaps, options, and forward
    contracts contain credit risk, which is the risk that our
    counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations.
    We reduce this risk through using established policies and
    procedures. For each counterparty, we assess credit quality by
    considering credit ratings, financial condition, and other
    available information. We establish a credit limit for each
    counterparty based upon our evaluation of its credit quality. We
    monitor our exposure to potential loss under each contract and
    take action when appropriate.

CMS ERM enters into contracts primarily with companies in the
    electric and gas industry. This industry concentration may have
    a positive or negative impact on our exposure to credit risk
    based on how similar changes in economic conditions, the
    weather, or other conditions affect these counterparties. CMS
    ERM reduces its credit risk exposure by using industry-standard
    agreements that allow for netting positive and negative
    exposures associated with the same counterparty. Typically,
    these agreements also allow each party to demand adequate
    assurance of future performance from the other party, when there
    is reason to do so.

The following table illustrates our exposure to potential losses
    at December 31, 2008, if each counterparty within this
    industry concentration failed to meet its contractual
    obligations. This table includes contracts accounted for as
    financial instruments. It does not include trade accounts
    receivable, derivative contracts that qualify as normal
    purchases and sales under SFAS No. 133, or other
    contracts that we do not account for as derivatives.

    counterparty nonperformance.

Pension Plan:

The Pension Plan includes funds
    for most of our current employees, the employees of our
    subsidiaries, and Panhandle, a former subsidiary. The Pension
    Plan’s assets are not distinguishable by company.

On September 1, 2005, we implemented the DCCP. The DCCP
    provides an employer contribution of five percent of base pay to
    the existing employees’ 401(k) plan. No employee
    contribution is required in order to receive the plan’s
    employer contribution. All employees hired on and after
    September 1, 2005 participate in this plan. Participants in
    the cash balance pension plan, in effect from July 1, 2003
    to September 1, 2005, also participate in the DCCP as of
    September 1, 2005. Additional pay credits under the cash
    balance pension plan were discontinued as of that date. The DCCP
    expense was $3 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008 and $2 million for the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006.

SERP:

SERP benefits are paid from a trust
    established in 1988. SERP is not a qualified plan under the
    Internal Revenue Code. SERP trust earnings are taxable and trust
    assets are included in our consolidated assets. Trust assets
    were $69 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $95 million at December 31, 2007. The assets are
    classified as Other non-current assets on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The ABO for SERP was $80 million at
    December 31, 2008 and $83 million at December 31,
    2007. A contribution of $25 million was made to the trust
    in December 2007.

On April 1, 2006, we implemented a DC SERP and froze
    further new participation in the defined benefit SERP. The DC
    SERP provides participants benefits ranging from 5 percent
    to 15 percent of total compensation. The DC SERP requires a
    minimum of five years of participation before vesting. Our
    contributions to the plan, if any, will be placed in a grantor
    trust. Trust assets were less than $1 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. The assets are classified as
    Other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
    DC SERP expense was less than $1 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

401(k):

The employer’s match for the 401(k) plan is
    60 percent on eligible contributions up to the first six
    percent of an employee’s wages. The total 401(k) plan cost
    was $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and
    $15 million for the year end December 31, 2006.

EISP:

We implemented a nonqualified EISP in 2002 to
    provide flexibility in separation of employment by officers, a
    selected group of management, or other highly compensated
    employees. Terms of the plan may include payment of a lump sum,
    payment of monthly benefits for life, payment of premiums for
    continuation of health care, or any other legally permissible
    term deemed to be in our best interest to offer. The EISP
    expense was less than $1 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 and $1 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006. The ABO for the EISP was
    $4 million at December 31, 2008 and December 31,
    2007.

OPEB:

The OPEB plan covers all regular full-time
    employees who are covered by the employee health care plan on a
    company-subsidized basis the day before they retire from the
    company at age 55 or older and who have at least 10 full
    years of applicable continuous service. Regular full-time
    employees who qualify for a pension plan disability retirement
    and have 15 years of applicable continuous service are also
    eligible. Retiree health care costs were based on the assumption
    that costs would increase 8.0 percent for those under 65
    and 9.5 percent for those over 65 in 2008. The 2009 rate of
    increase for OPEB health costs for those under 65 is expected to
    be 8.5 percent and for those over 65 is expected to be
    8.0 percent. The rate of increase is expected to slow to
    5 percent for those under 65 by 2017 and for those over 65
    by 2017 and thereafter.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 106 in 1992, we recorded a
    liability of $466 million for the accumulated transition
    obligation and a corresponding regulatory asset for anticipated
    recovery in utility rates. For additional details, see
    Note 1, Corporate Structure and Accounting Policies,
    “Utility Regulation.” The MPSC authorized recovery of
    the electric utility portion of these costs in 1994 over
    18 years and the gas utility portion in 1996 over
    16 years.

SFAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R):

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 158. This standard required us to recognize
    the funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006.
    SFAS No. 158 also required us to recognize changes in
    the funded status of our plans in the year in which the changes
    occur. In addition, the standard required that we change our
    plan measurement date from November 30 to December 31,
    effective December 31, 2008. In the first quarter of 2008,
    we recorded the measurement date change, which resulted in a
    $6 million net-of-tax decrease to retained earnings, a
    $4 million reduction to the SFAS No. 158
    regulatory assets, a $7 million increase in Postretirement
    benefit liabilities, and a $5 million increase in Deferred
    tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In April 2008, the MPSC issued an order in our PSCR case that
    allowed us to collect a one-time surcharge under a pension and
    OPEB equalization mechanism. For 2008, we collected
    $10 million of pension and $2 million of OPEB
    surcharge revenue in electric rates. We recorded a reduction of
    $12 million of equalization regulatory assets on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets and an increase of $12 million
    of expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).
    Thus, our collection of the equalization mechanism surcharge had
    no impact on net income for the year ended December 31,
    2008.

The discount rate is set to reflect the rates at which benefits
    can be effectively settled. It is set equal to the equivalent
    single rate that results from a yield curve analysis that
    incorporates projected benefit payments specific to our pension
    and other postretirement benefit plans, and the yields on high
    quality corporate bonds rated Aa or better.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(b)

We determine our long-term rate of return by considering
    historical market returns, the current and expected future
    economic environment, the capital market principles of risk and
    return, and the expert opinions of individuals and firms with
    financial market knowledge. We consider the asset allocation of
    the portfolio in forecasting the future expected total return of
    the portfolio. The goal is to determine a long-term rate of
    return that can be incorporated into the planning of future cash
    flow requirements in conjunction with the change in the
    liability. Annually, we review for reasonableness and
    appropriateness of the forecasted returns for various classes of
    assets used to construct an expected return model.

(c)

The mortality assumption is based on the RP-2000 mortality
    tables with projection of future mortality improvements using
    Scale AA, which aligns with the IRS prescriptions for cash
    funding valuations under the Pension Protection Act.

NOTES TO

The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined
    benefit pension plans that will be amortized into net periodic
    benefit cost over the next fiscal year from the regulatory asset
    is $44 million and from AOCL is $3 million. The
    estimated net loss and prior service credit for OPEB plans that
    will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the next
    fiscal year from the regulatory asset is $23 million and
    from AOCL is $1 million.

We amortize gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the
    greater of the benefit obligation and the MRV over the average
    remaining service period. The estimated time of amortization of
    gains and losses is 12 years for pension and 14 years
    for OPEB. Prior service cost amortization is established in the
    years in which the prior service cost first occurred, and are
    based on the same amortization period in all future years until
    the prior service costs are fully recognized. The estimated time
    of amortization of new prior service costs is 12 years for
    pension and 10 years for OPEB.

We contributed $51 million to our OPEB plan in 2008 and we
    plan to contribute $53 million to our OPEB plan in 2009. Of
    the $51 million OPEB contribution made during 2008,
    $10 million was contributed to the 401(h) component of the
    qualified pension plan and the remaining $41 million was
    contributed to the VEBA trust accounts. We did not contribute to
    our Pension Plan in 2008, but plan to contribute
    $300 million to our Pension Plan in 2009. Contributions
    include required and discretionary amounts. Actual future
    contributions will depend on future investment performance,
    changes in future discount rates, and various other factors
    related to the populations participating in the plans.

In 2008, the consultant for the Pension Plan, recommended an
    adjustment to the target asset allocation for Pension Plan
    assets. The recommended revised target asset allocation for the
    Pension Plan assets was 50 percent equity, 30 percent
    fixed income, and 20 percent alternative strategy
    investments from the previous target of 60 percent equity,
    30 percent fixed income and 10 percent alternative
    strategy investments. This recommendation was thoroughly
    reviewed and approved by our Benefit Administration Committee.
    This adjustment is being made gradually by the allocation of
    contributions into alternative assets and the drawdown of
    equities to cover plan benefit payments and distributions. This
    revised target asset allocation is expected to continue to
    maximize the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining
    a prudent level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a
    function of the liabilities of the plan. Equity investments are
    diversified mostly across the Standard & Poor’s
    500 Index, with lesser allocations to the Standard &
    Poor’s MidCap and SmallCap Indexes and Foreign Equity
    Funds. Fixed-income investments are diversified across
    investment grade instruments of both government and corporate
    issuers as well as

CMS-81


CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

high-yield and global bond funds. Alternative strategies are
    diversified across absolute return investment approaches and
    global tactical asset allocation. We use annual liability
    measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic
    asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to
    the portfolio allocation.

We established union and non-union VEBA trusts to fund our
    future retiree health and life insurance benefits. These trusts
    are funded through the ratemaking process for Consumers and
    through direct contributions from the non-utility subsidiaries.
    We invest the equity portions of the union and non-union health
    care VEBA trusts in a Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
    fund. We invest the fixed-income portion of the union health
    care VEBA trust in domestic investment grade taxable
    instruments. We invest the fixed-income portion of the non-union
    health care VEBA trust in a diversified mix of domestic
    tax-exempt securities. The investment selections of each VEBA
    trust are influenced by the tax consequences, as well as the
    objective of generating asset returns that will meet the medical
    and life insurance costs of retirees.

SFAS No. 132(R) Benefit Payments:

    $8 million for 2012 and 2013 and $50 million combined
    for 2014 through 2018.

9: ASSET
    RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations:

This standard requires us to record
    the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their
    useful lives, if there is a legal obligation to remove them. No
    market risk premium was included in our ARO fair value estimate
    since a reasonable estimate could not be made. If a five percent
    market risk premium were assumed, our ARO liability at
    December 31, 2008 would increase by $10 million.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the
    period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with
    indeterminate lives, the liability is to be recognized when a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Historically, our
    gas transmission and electric and gas distribution assets have
    indeterminate lives and retirement cash flows that cannot be
    determined. During 2007, however, we implemented a new fixed
    asset accounting system that facilitates ARO accounting
    estimates for gas distribution mains and services. The new
    system enabled us to calculate a reasonable estimate of the fair
    value of the cost to cut, purge, and cap abandoned gas
    distribution mains and services at the end of their useful
    lives. We recorded a $101 million ARO liability and an
    asset of equal value at December 31, 2007. We have not
    recorded a liability for assets that have insignificant
    cumulative disposal costs, such as substation batteries.

FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations:

This
    Interpretation clarified the term “conditional asset
    retirement obligation” used in SFAS No. 143. The
    term refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement
    activity in which the timing or method of settlement are
    conditional on a future event. We determined that abatement of
    asbestos included in our plant investments and the cut, purge,
    and cap of abandoned gas distribution mains and services qualify
    as conditional AROs, as defined by FIN 47.

10: INCOME
    TAXES

CMS Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal
    income tax return and a combined Michigan income tax return.
    Income taxes generally are allocated based on each
    company’s separate taxable income in accordance with the
    CMS Energy tax sharing agreement.

We use deferred tax accounting for temporary differences. These
    occur when there are differences between the book and tax
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. ITC has been
    deferred and is being amortized over the estimated service lives
    of the related properties. We use ITC to reduce current income
    taxes payable.

AMT paid generally becomes a tax credit that we can carry
    forward indefinitely to reduce regular tax liabilities in future
    periods when regular taxes paid exceed the tax calculated for
    AMT. At December 31, 2008, we had AMT credit carryforwards
    of $272 million that do not expire, federal tax loss
    carryforwards of $1.302 billion that expire from 2023
    through 2028 and Michigan tax loss carryforwards of
    $383 million that expire in 2018. In addition, we have a
    net benefit of $160 million for future Michigan tax
    deductions which were granted as part of the Michigan Business
    Tax legislation of 2007. We do not believe that a valuation
    allowance is required, as we expect to use the loss
    carryforwards prior to their expiration. We also have general
    business credit carryforwards of $20 million that expire
    from 2009 through 2028. We have provided $2 million of
    valuation allowances for these items. It is reasonably possible
    that further adjustments will be made to the valuation allowance
    within one year.

In January 2009, the State of Michigan enacted changes to the
    Michigan Business Tax, which were retroactive to January 1,
    2008. These changes included the decoupling from federal bonus
    depreciation, which reduces the Michigan tax loss carryforward
    previously discussed by approximately $160 million.

The significant components of income tax expense (benefit) on

Current tax expense reflects the settlement of income tax audits

    are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary
    differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and
    the reported amounts in our consolidated

financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    classified as current or noncurrent according to the
    classification of the related assets or liabilities. Deferred
    tax assets and liabilities not related to assets or liabilities
    are classified according to the expected reversal date of the
    temporary differences.

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits
    by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which can result
    in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome
    for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe
    that our accrued tax liabilities at December 31, 2008 are
    adequate for all years.

In June 2006, the IRS concluded its audit of CMS Energy and its
    subsidiaries and adjusted taxable income for the years ended
    December 31, 1987 through December 31, 2001. The
    overall cumulative increase to taxable income related primarily
    to the disallowance of the simplified service cost method with
    respect to certain self-constructed utility assets, resulting in
    a deferral of these expenses to future years. Reduction of our
    income tax provision is primarily due to the restoration and
    utilization of previously written off income tax credits. The
    years 2002 through 2007 are currently open under the statute of
    limitations and 2002 through 2005 are currently under audit by
    the IRS.

As of December 31, 2006, U.S. income taxes were not
    recorded on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    that had been or were intended to be reinvested indefinitely.
    During the first quarter of 2007, we announced we had signed
    agreements or plans to sell substantially all of our foreign
    assets or subsidiaries. These sales resulted in the recognition
    in 2007 of $71 million of U.S. income tax expense
    associated with the change in our assumption regarding permanent
    reinvestment of these undistributed earnings, with
    $46 million of this amount reflected in income from
    continuing operations and $25 million in discontinued
    operations. Additionally, gains on the sales of our
    international investments resulted in the release of
    $121 million of valuation allowance during 2007.

On January 1, 2007 we adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48,
    we recorded a charge for additional uncertain tax benefits of
    $11 million, which was accounted for as a reduction of our
    beginning retained earnings. Included in this amount was an
    increase in our valuation allowance of $100 million,
    decreases to tax reserves of $61 million and a decrease to
    deferred tax liabilities of $28 million.

Included in the balance at December 31, 2008 are
    $55 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of
    the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and
    penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period
    would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would
    accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an
    earlier period. As of December 31, 2008, remaining
    uncertain tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate
    in future years are $10 million. It is reasonably possible
    that, within the next twelve months, we will settle with the IRS
    on our simplified service cost methodology, a timing issue. An
    estimate of a settlement range cannot be made at this point.

As of December 31, 2007 we had accrued $2 million of net
    interest expense on our uncertain tax liabilities. We accrued a
    net additional $1 million of interest on tax liabilities
    during 2008. The total net interest liability is $6 million
    as of December 31, 2008, $3 million of which relates
    to uncertain tax positions. We have not accrued any penalties
    with respect to uncertain tax benefits. We recognize accrued
    interest and penalties, where applicable, related to uncertain
    tax benefits as part of income tax expense.

11: STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

We provide a Performance Incentive Stock Plan (the Plan) to key
    employees and non-employee directors based on their
    contributions to the successful management of the company. The
    Plan has a five-year term, expiring in May 2009.

All grants under the Plan for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were in the
    form of TSR restricted stock and time-lapse restricted stock.
    Restricted stock recipients receive shares of CMS Energy Common
    Stock that have full dividend and voting rights. TSR restricted
    stock vesting is contingent on meeting a three-year service
    requirement and specific market conditions. Half of the market
    condition is based on the achievement of specified levels of TSR
    over a three-year period and half is based on a comparison of
    our TSR with the median shareholders’ return of a peer
    group over the same three-year period. Depending on the
    performance of the market, a recipient may earn a total award
    ranging from zero to 150 percent of the initial grant.
    Time-lapse restricted stock vests after a service period of five
    years for awards granted prior to 2004, and three years for
    awards granted in 2004 and thereafter. Restricted stock awards
    granted to officers in 2006 were entirely TSR restricted stock.
    Awards granted to officers in 2007 and 2008 were
    80 percent TSR restricted stock and 20 percent
    time-lapsed restricted stock.

All restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if
    employment terminates before vesting. However, if certain
    minimum service requirements are met or are waived by action of
    the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of
    Directors, restricted shares may vest fully upon:

•

retirement,

•

disability, or

CMS-87


CMS ENERGY

•

change of control of CMS Energy, as defined by the Plan.

The Plan also allows for stock options, stock appreciation
    rights, phantom shares, and performance units, none of which
    were granted in 2008, 2007, or 2006.

Shares awarded or subject to stock options, phantom shares, and
    performance units may not exceed 6 million shares from June
    2004 through May 2009, nor may such awards to any recipient
    exceed 250,000 shares in any fiscal year. We may issue
    awards of up to 3,384,080 shares of common stock under the
    Plan at December 31, 2008. Shares for which payment or
    exercise is in cash, as well as forfeited shares or stock
    options, may be awarded or granted again under the Plan.

The following table summarizes restricted stock activity under
    the Plan:

During 2008, we granted 482,240 TSR shares and 257,110
    time-lapse shares of restricted stock.

(b)

During 2008, 432,500 TSR shares granted in 2005 were forfeited
    due to the failure to meet the specific market conditions.

We expense the awards’ fair value over the required service
    period. As a result, we recognize all compensation expense for
    share-based awards that have accelerated service provisions upon
    retirement by the period in which the employee becomes eligible
    to retire. We calculate the fair value of time-lapse restricted
    stock based on the price of our common stock on the grant date.
    We calculate the fair value of TSR restricted stock awards on
    the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. We base expected
    volatilities on the historical volatility of the price of CMS
    Energy Common Stock.

The risk-free rate for each valuation was based on the
    three-year U.S. Treasury yield at the award grant date. The
    following table summarizes the significant assumptions used to
    estimate the fair value of the TSR restricted stock awards:

The total fair value of shares vested was $2 million in
    2008, $15 million in 2007, and $4 million in 2006.
    Compensation expense related to restricted stock was
    $8 million in 2008, $10 million in 2007, and
    $9 million in 2006. The total related income tax benefit
    recognized in income was $3 million in 2008,
    $3 million in 2007, and $3 million in 2006. At
    December 31, 2008, there was $7 million of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock. We
    expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of
    2.3 years.

Stock options give the holder the right to purchase common stock
    at the market price on the grant date. Stock options are
    exercisable upon grant, and expire up to ten years and one month
    from the grant date. We issue new shares when recipients
    exercise stock options. The total intrinsic value of stock
    options exercised was $1 million in 2008, $9 million
    in 2007, and $1 million in 2006. Cash received from
    exercise of these stock options was $1 million in 2008.

Since we have utilized tax loss carryforwards, we were not able
    to realize the excess tax benefits upon exercise of stock
    options and vesting of restricted stock. Therefore, we did not
    recognize the related excess tax benefits in equity. As of
    December 31, 2008, we have $17 million of unrealized
    excess tax benefits.

No stock options were granted in 2008, 2007, or 2006.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to use the fair
    value of employee stock options and similar awards at the grant
    date to value the awards. SFAS No. 123(R) was
    effective for us on January 1, 2006. We elected to adopt
    the modified prospective method recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R) instead of retrospective restatement.
    We adopted the fair value method of accounting for share-based
    awards effective December 2002. Therefore,
    SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a significant impact on
    our results of operations when it became effective.

12: LEASES

We lease various assets, including service vehicles, railcars,
    gas pipeline capacity and buildings. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 13, we account for a number of our power
    purchase agreements as capital and operating leases.

Operating leases for coal-carrying railcars have lease terms
    expiring over the next 15 years. These leases contain fair
    market value extension and buyout provisions, with some
    providing for predetermined extension period rentals. Capital
    leases for our vehicle fleet operations have a maximum term of
    120 months and TRAC end-of-life provisions.

We have capital leases for gas transportation pipelines to the
    Karn generating complex and Zeeland power plant. The capital
    lease for the gas transportation pipeline into the Karn
    generating complex has a term of 15 years with a provision
    to extend the contract from month to month. The capital lease
    for the gas transportation pipeline to the Zeeland power plant
    has a lease term of 12 years with a renewal provision at
    the end of the contract. The

remaining term of our long-term power purchase agreements range
    between 2 and 22 years. Most of our power purchase
    agreements contain provisions at the end of the initial contract
    terms to renew the agreements annually.

Consumers is authorized by the MPSC to record both capital and
    operating lease payments as operating expense and recover the
    total cost from our customers. The following table summarizes

Asset Acquisition:

In December 2007, we
    purchased a 935 MW gas-based generating plant located in
    Zeeland, Michigan for $519 million from an affiliate of LS
    Power Group. The original cost of the plant was
    $350 million and the plant acquisition adjustment was
    $213 million. This results in an increase to property,
    plant, and equipment of $519 million, net of
    $44 million of accumulated depreciation. The purchase also
    increased capital leases by $12 million. For additional
    details on the Zeeland finance lease, see Note 12, Leases.

Included in net property, plant and equipment are intangible
    assets. The following table summarizes our intangible assets:

Intangible asset additions for our utility plant were

    business software system. Intangible asset additions for our
    utility plant were $232 million during 2007, which included
    the Zeeland $213 million plant acquisition adjustment.
    Retirements were $23 million during 2007.

Pretax amortization expense related to intangible assets was
    $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, and
    $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. We
    expect intangible assets amortization to range between
    $25 million and $29 million per year over the next
    five years.

14: EQUITY
    METHOD INVESTMENTS

We account for certain investments in other companies and
    partnerships using the equity method, in accordance with APB
    Opinion No. 18, when we have significant influence,
    typically when ownership is more than 20 percent but less
    than a majority. Earnings from equity method investments were
    $5 million in 2008, $40 million in 2007, and
    $89 million in 2006. The amount of consolidated retained
    earnings that represents undistributed earnings from these
    equity method investments was $1 million at
    December 31, 2008, $22 million at December 31,
    2007, and $14 million at December 31, 2006.

If assets or income from continuing operations associated with
    any of our individual equity method investments, or on an
    aggregate basis by any combination of equity method investments,
    exceed 10 percent of our consolidated assets or income,
    then we must present summarized financial data of that
    subsidiary or combination of subsidiaries in our notes. At
    December 31, 2008, no individual equity method investment
    or combination of investments exceeded the 10 percent
    threshold.

    proportion to each participant’s undivided ownership
    interest. We are required to provide only our share of financing
    for the jointly owned utility facilities.

16: REPORTABLE
    SEGMENTS

Our reportable segments consist of business units defined by the
    products and services they offer. We evaluate performance based
    on the net income of each segment. These reportable segments are:

•

electric utility, consisting of regulated activities associated
    with the generation and distribution of electricity in Michigan
    through our subsidiary, Consumers,

•

gas utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with
    the transportation, storage, and distribution of natural gas in
    Michigan through our subsidiary, Consumers, and

•

enterprises, consisting of various subsidiaries engaging
    primarily in domestic independent power production.

Accounting policies of our segments are as described in
    Note 1, Corporate Structure and Accounting Policies. Our
    consolidated financial statements reflect the assets,
    liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the individual segments
    when appropriate. We allocate accounts among the segments when
    common accounts are attributable to more than one segment. The
    allocations are based on certain measures of business
    activities, such as revenue, labor dollars, customers, other
    operation and maintenance expense, construction expense, leased
    property, taxes or functional surveys. For example, customer
    receivables are allocated based on revenue, and pension
    provisions are allocated based on labor dollars.

We account for inter-segment sales and transfers at current
    market prices and eliminate them in consolidated net income
    (loss) by segment. The “Other” segment includes
    corporate interest and other expenses, and certain deferred
    income taxes. We have reclassified certain amounts in 2006 to
    include CMS Capital results in the Other segment.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

17: CONSOLIDATION
    OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

FIN 46(R) requires the consolidation of entities that are
    VIEs if the reporting company determines that it will absorb a
    majority of the VIE’s expected losses, receive a majority
    of the VIE’s residual returns, or both. The company that is
    required to consolidate the VIE is called the primary
    beneficiary. Variable interests are contractual, ownership or
    other interests in an entity that change as the fair value of
    the entity’s net assets, excluding variable interests,
    change. An entity is considered to be a VIE when its capital is
    insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without
    additional subordinated financial support or its equity
    investors, as a group, lack the characteristics of having a
    controlling financial interest. When determining whether we are
    the primary beneficiary of a VIE we examine the following
    factors:

•

related party agreements such as operating and maintenance
    agreements, power purchase agreements and leases,

•

ownership interest, and

•

allocation of expected losses and return based on discounted
    cash flows at a weighted average cost of capital.

We are the primary beneficiary of three VIEs through our
    ownership interests in the following partnerships:

Total

148 MW

We consolidated these entities for all periods presented.

We have operating and management contracts with these
    partnerships and we are the primary purchaser of power from each
    partnership through long-term power purchase agreements. We also
    have reduced dispatch agreements with Grayling and Genesee,
    which allow the relative facilities to be dispatched based on
    the market price of wood waste. This results in fuel cost
    savings, which the partnerships share with us.

The partnerships have third-party obligations totaling
    $76 million at December 31, 2008 and $83 million
    at December 31, 2007. Property, plant, and equipment
    serving as collateral for these obligations have a carrying
    value of $145 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $180 million at December 31, 2007. Other than through
    outstanding letters of credit and guarantees of $5 million,
    the creditors of these partnerships do not have recourse to the
    general credit of CMS Energy. We have not provided financial or
    other support during the periods presented that were not
    previously contractually required.

Additionally, through our trust preferred security structure, we
    hold an interest in a variable interest entity in which we are
    not the primary beneficiary. We deconsolidated the entity and
    reflected it as Long-term debt-Related parties. Our maximum
    exposure to loss through our interest is limited to our
    Long-term debt-Related parties balance of $178 million. For
    additional information, see Note 5, Financings and
    Capitalization, “Long-Term Debt-Related Parties.”

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

CMS Energy Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of income (loss), of cash
    flows, and of common stockholders’ equity present fairly,
    in all material respects, the financial position of CMS Energy
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the
    accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
    related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion,
    the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements and financial statement
    schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial
    statement schedules, and on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We
    conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain income tax provisions in 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
    detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

CMS Energy Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
    income (loss), common stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    of CMS Energy Corporation (a Michigan Corporation) for the year
    ended December 31, 2006. Our audit also included the
    financial statement schedules as it relates to 2006 listed in
    the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and
    schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedules based on our audit. We did
    not audit the financial statements of Midland Cogeneration
    Venture Limited Partnership, a former 49% owned variable
    interest entity which has been consolidated through the date of
    sale, November 21, 2006 (Note 3), which statements
    reflect total revenues constituting 8.9% in 2006 of the related
    consolidated totals. Those statements were audited by other
    auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion
    on the consolidated financial statements, insofar as it relates
    to the amounts included for the period indicated above for
    Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership, is based
    solely on the report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audit and the report
    of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other
    auditors, the financial statements referred to above present
    fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated results of
    CMS Energy Corporation’s operations and its cash flows for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial
    statements, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
    132(R),” the Company changed its method of accounting for
    the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans in 2006.

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

Consumers, a subsidiary of CMS Energy, a holding company, is a
    combination electric and gas utility company serving in
    Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Our customer base includes a
    mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial
    customers.

We manage our business by the nature of service provided and
    operate principally in two business segments: electric utility
    and gas utility. Our electric utility operations include the
    generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity. Our
    gas utility operations include the purchase, transportation,
    storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas.

We earn our revenue and generate cash from operations by
    providing electric and natural gas utility services, electric
    power generation, gas distribution, transmission, and storage,
    and other energy-related services. Our businesses are affected
    primarily by:

•

weather, especially during the normal heating and cooling
    seasons,

•

economic conditions,

•

regulation and regulatory issues,

•

energy commodity prices,

•

interest rates, and

•

our debt credit rating.

During the past several years, our business strategy has
    emphasized improving our consolidated balance sheet and
    maintaining focus on our core strength: utility operations and
    service.

    the utility over the period from 2009 through 2013, with a key
    aspect of our strategy being our Balanced Energy Initiative. Our
    Balanced Energy Initiative is a comprehensive energy resource
    plan to meet our projected short-term and long-term electric
    power requirements with energy efficiency, demand management,
    expanded use of renewable energy, and development of new power
    plants and pursuit of additional power purchase agreements to
    complement existing generating sources.

In October 2008, the Michigan governor signed into law a
    comprehensive energy reform package. In February 2009, we filed
    our renewable energy plan and energy optimization plan with the
    MPSC in order to conform to various aspects of this legislation.

As we work to implement plans to serve our customers in the
    future, the cost of energy and related cash flow issues continue
    to challenge us. Natural gas prices and eastern coal prices have
    been volatile. These costs are recoverable from our utility
    customers; however, as prices increase, the amount we pay for
    these commodities will require additional liquidity due to the
    lag in cost recoveries. There is additional uncertainty
    associated with state and federal legislative and regulatory
    proposals related to regulation of carbon dioxide emissions,
    particularly associated with coal-based generation. We are
    closely monitoring these developments for the effect on our
    future plans.

We are developing an advanced metering infrastructure system
    that will provide enhanced controls and information about our
    customer energy usage and notification of service interruptions.
    We expect to develop integration software and pilot this new
    technology over the next two to three years.

In the future, we will continue to focus our strategy on:

•

investing in our utility system to enable us to meet our
    customer commitments, improve customer service, comply with
    increasing environmental performance standards, improve system
    performance, and maintain adequate supply and capacity,

•

growing earnings while controlling operating and fuel costs,

•

managing cash flow, and

•

maintaining principles of safe, efficient operations, customer
    value, fair and timely regulation, and consistent financial
    performance.

As we execute our strategy, we will need to overcome a Michigan
    economy that has been adversely impacted by the continued
    downturn and uncertainty in Michigan’s automotive industry.
    There also has been a sharp economic downturn, uncertainty, and
    extreme volatility in the financial and credit markets resulting
    from the subprime mortgage crisis, bank failures and
    consolidation, and other market weaknesses. While we believe
    that our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our
    requirements, we continue to monitor closely developments in the
    financial and credit markets and government response to those
    developments for potential implications for our business.

For 2008, our net income available to our common stockholder was
    $362 million, compared to $310 million for 2007. The
    increase reflects higher net income from our electric utility
    segment primarily due to rate increases authorized in December
    2007 and June 2008 and reduced costs associated with our power
    purchase agreement with the MCV Partnership. Partially
    offsetting these increases was a decrease in electric deliveries
    and increased depreciation expense.

Specific changes to net income available to our common
    stockholder for 2008 versus 2007 are:

For 2007, our net income available to our common stockholder was
    $310 million, compared to $184 million for 2006. In
    2006, we sold our ownership interest in the MCV Partnership.
    Accordingly, in 2007, we no longer experienced mark-to-market
    losses on certain long-term gas contracts and associated
    financial hedges at the MCV Partnership. The increase in 2007
    also reflects higher net income from our gas utility due to
    colder weather and gas rate increases authorized in November
    2006 and August 2007. Partially offsetting these gains was a
    small decrease in electric net income, influenced by several
    factors, including regulatory disallowances in 2007, higher
    property taxes, and higher electric deliveries.

Electric deliveries and rate increase:

For 2008,
    electric delivery revenues increased $89 million versus
    2007 primarily due to additional revenue of $168 million
    from the inclusion of the Zeeland power plant in rates and from
    the June 2008 rate order. The increase was partially offset by
    decreased electric revenue of $79 million primarily due to
    lower deliveries. Deliveries to end-use customers were
    37.5 billion kWh, a decrease of 1.3 billion kWh or
    3 percent versus 2007. Approximately 45 percent of the
    decrease in electric deliveries was due to weather.

CE-8


Consumers
    Energy Company

For 2007, electric delivery revenues decreased $118 million
    versus 2006. The decrease was primarily due to $136 million
    of revenue related to Palisades that was designated toward the
    recovery of PSCR costs consistent with the MPSC order related to
    the sale in April 2007. Partially offsetting the decrease were
    increased electric delivery revenues of $14 million, as
    deliveries to end-use customers were 38.8 billion kWh, an
    increase of 0.3 billion kWh or 0.8 percent versus
    2006. The increase in electric deliveries was primarily due to
    favorable weather. Also contributing to the increase was
    $2 million of additional revenue from the inclusion of the
    Zeeland power plant in rates and $2 million related to the
    return of additional former ROA customers.

Surcharge revenue:

For 2008, surcharge revenue
    increased $15 million versus 2007. The increase was
    primarily due to the April 2008 MPSC order allowing recovery of
    pension and OPEB benefits through a surcharge. Consistent with
    the recovery of these costs, we recognized a similar amount of
    benefit expense. For additional details, see “Depreciation
    and other operating expenses” within this section and
    Note 7, Retirement Benefits.

For 2007, surcharge revenue increased $6 million versus
    2006. The increase was primarily due to a surcharge that we
    began collecting in the first quarter of 2006 that the MPSC
    authorized under Section 10d(4) of the Customer Choice Act.

Power supply costs and related revenue:

For 2008,
    PSCR revenue increased by $18 million versus 2007. The
    increase primarily reflects the absence of a 2007 reduction to
    revenue made in response to the MPSC’s position that PSCR
    discounts given to our Transitional Primary Rate customers could
    not be recovered under the PSCR mechanism.

For 2007, PSCR revenue decreased by $17 million versus
    2006. This decrease primarily reflects amounts excluded from
    recovery in the 2006 PSCR reconciliation case. The decrease also
    reflects the absence, in 2007, of an increase in power supply
    revenue associated with the 2005 PSCR reconciliation case.

Non-commodity revenue:

For 2008, non-commodity
    revenue decreased $14 million versus 2007 primarily due to
    the absence, in 2008, of METC transmission services revenue. The
    METC transmission service agreement expired in April 2007.

For 2007, non-commodity revenue decreased $12 million
    versus 2006 primarily due to lower METC transmission services
    revenue.

Depreciation and other operating expenses:

For 2008,
    depreciation and other operating expenses decreased
    $40 million versus 2007. The decrease was primarily due to
    the absence of operating expenses of Palisades, which was sold
    in April 2007, and certain costs that are no longer incurred
    under our power purchase agreement with the MCV Partnership.
    Also contributing to the decrease in expenses was the April 2008
    MPSC order allowing us to retain a portion of the proceeds from
    the 2006 sale of certain sulfur dioxide allowances. The decrease
    was partially offset by higher pension and OPEB expense due to
    the April 2008 MPSC order allowing recovery of certain costs
    through a surcharge, increased depreciation and amortization
    expense due to more plant in service and increased amortization
    of certain regulatory assets. For additional details on our
    power purchase agreement with the MCV Partnership, see
    Note 4, Contingencies, “Other Electric
    Contingencies.”

For 2007, depreciation and other operating expenses decreased
    $150 million versus 2006. The decrease was primarily due to
    lower operating expenses of Palisades, which was sold in April
    2007. Also contributing to the decrease was the absence, in
    2007, of costs incurred in 2006 related to a refueling outage at
    Palisades, and lower overhead line maintenance and storm
    restoration costs. These decreases were offset partially by
    increased depreciation and amortization expense due to more
    plant in service and increased amortization of certain
    regulatory assets.

Other income:

For 2008, other income decreased
    $46 million versus 2007. The decrease was primarily due to
    reduced interest income, reflecting lower levels of short-term
    cash investments, and the MPSC’s June 2008 order, which did
    not allow us to recover all of our costs associated with the
    sale of Palisades. Also contributing to the decrease was a
    charge that recognized an other-than-temporary decline in the
    fair value of our SERP investments.

CE-9


Consumers
    Energy Company

For 2007, other income increased $26 million versus 2006
    primarily due to higher interest income on short-term cash
    investments. The increase in short-term cash investments was
    primarily due to proceeds from the Palisades sale and equity
    infusions from CMS Energy.

General taxes:

For 2008, general tax expense
    decreased $15 million versus 2007 primarily due to the
    absence, in 2008, of MSBT, which was replaced with the Michigan
    Business Tax effective January 1, 2008. The Michigan
    Business Tax is an income tax. The decrease was partially offset
    by higher property tax expense.

For 2007, general tax expense increased $15 million versus
    2006 primarily due to higher property tax expense, reflecting
    higher millage rates and lower property tax refunds versus 2006.

Interest charges:

For 2008, interest charges
    decreased $11 million versus 2007 primarily due to lower
    interest associated with amounts to be refunded to our customers
    as a result of the sale of Palisades. The MPSC order approving
    the Palisades power purchase agreement with Entergy directed us
    to record interest on the unrefunded balances. Also contributing
    to the decrease was the absence, in 2008, of interest charges
    related to an IRS settlement.

For 2007, interest charges increased $18 million versus
    2006. The increase was primarily due to interest on amounts to
    be refunded to customers as a result of the sale of Palisades as
    ordered by the MPSC and interest charges related to the IRS
    settlement.

Income taxes:

For 2008, income taxes increased
    $53 million versus 2007. The increase primarily reflects
    $47 million due to higher earnings and $6 million due
    to the inclusion of the Michigan Business Tax.

For 2007, income taxes increased $5 million versus 2006
    primarily due to the absence, in 2007, of a $4 million
    income tax benefit from the restoration and utilization of
    income tax credits resulting from the resolution of an IRS
    income tax audit.

Gas deliveries and rate increase:

For 2008, gas
    delivery revenues increased $44 million versus 2007
    primarily due to additional revenue of $33 million from the
    MPSC’s August 2007 and December 2008 gas rate orders. Also
    contributing to the increase was higher gas delivery revenue of
    $11 million. Gas deliveries, including miscellaneous
    transportation to end-use customers, were 304 bcf, an increase
    of 4 bcf or 1.3 percent. The increase in gas deliveries was
    due to colder weather in 2008.

For 2007, gas delivery revenues increased $91 million
    versus 2006 primarily due to additional revenue of
    $81 million from the MPSC’s November 2006 and August
    2007 gas rate orders. Gas delivery revenues also increased
    $10 million as gas deliveries, including miscellaneous
    transportation to end-use customers, were 300 bcf,

an increase of 18 bcf or 6.4 percent. The increase in gas
    deliveries was primarily due to colder weather, partially offset
    by higher system losses.

Gas wholesale and retail services, other gas revenues, and
    other income:

For 2008, gas wholesale and retail services,
    other gas revenues, and other income decreased $28 million
    versus 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest
    income reflecting lower short-term investments, and lower
    pipeline capacity optimization revenue. Also contributing to the
    decrease was a charge that recognized an other-than-temporary
    decline in the fair value of our SERP investments.

For 2007, gas wholesale and retail services, other gas revenues,
    and other income increased $14 million versus 2006. The
    increase was primarily due to higher interest income on
    short-term cash investments. The increase in short-term cash
    investments was primarily due to proceeds from the Palisades
    sale and equity infusions from CMS Energy.

Other operating expenses:

For 2008, other operating
    expenses increased $24 million versus 2007 primarily due to
    higher uncollectible accounts expense and higher operating
    expense across our storage, transmission and distribution
    systems.

For 2007, other operating expenses increased $19 million
    versus 2006 primarily due to higher uncollectible accounts
    expense and payments, beginning in November 2006, to a fund that
    provides energy assistance to low-income customers.

General taxes and depreciation:

For 2008, general
    taxes and depreciation increased $1 million versus 2007.
    The increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and
    increased property taxes. The increase was partially offset by
    decreased general taxes due to the absence, in 2008, of MSBT,
    which was replaced by the Michigan Business Tax effective
    January 1, 2008. The Michigan Business Tax is an income tax.

For 2007, general taxes and depreciation increased
    $11 million versus 2006. The increase in general taxes
    reflects higher property tax expense due to higher millage rates
    and lower property tax refunds versus 2006. The increase in
    depreciation expense is primarily due to higher plant in service.

Interest charges:

For 2008, interest charges
    decreased $9 million versus 2007 primarily due to lower
    average debt levels and a lower average interest rate.

For 2007, interest charges decreased $4 million versus 2006
    primarily due to lower average debt levels and a lower average
    interest rate versus 2006.

Income taxes:

For 2008, income taxes decreased
    $2 million versus 2007. The decrease reflects
    $4 million related to the tax treatment of items related to
    property, plant and equipment, as required by the MPSC orders.
    This decrease was partially offset by a $1 million increase
    due to the inclusion of the Michigan Business Tax and
    $1 million related to the forfeiture of restricted stock.

For 2007, income taxes increased $29 million versus 2006
    primarily due to higher earnings by the gas utility.

    income tax benefits.

For 2007, net income from other nonutility operations was
    $27 million, an increase of $79 million versus 2006.
    In late 2006, we sold our ownership interest in the MCV
    Partnership. Accordingly, in 2007, the increase in earnings
    primarily reflects the absence, in 2007, of mark-to-market
    losses on certain long-term gas contracts and associated

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following accounting policies and related information are
    important to an understanding of our results of operations and
    financial condition and should be considered an integral part of
    our MD&A. For additional accounting policies, see
    Note 1, Corporate Structure and Accounting Policies.

Use
    of Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we use
    estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and
    disclosures. We use accounting estimates for asset valuations,
    depreciation, amortization, financial and derivative
    instruments, employee benefits, indemnifications and
    contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimated results
    due to changes in the regulatory environment, competition,
    regulatory decisions, lawsuits, and other factors.

Contingencies:

We record a liability for
    contingencies when we conclude that it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors in making
    these assessments.

Fair Value Measurements:

We have assets and
    liabilities that we account for or disclose at fair value. Our
    fair value measurements are performed in accordance with
    SFAS No. 157, which requires the incorporation of all
    assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
    asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
    Development of these assumptions requires significant judgment.

The most material of our fair value measurements are of our SERP
    assets, our investment in CMS Energy Common Stock, and the
    year-end measurement of our pension and OPEB plan assets. For a
    detailed discussion of the methods used to calculate our fair
    value measurements, see Note 2, Fair Value Measurements.

Long-Lived Assets and Investments:

Our assessment of the
    recoverability of long-lived assets and investments involves
    critical accounting estimates. We periodically perform tests of
    impairment if certain conditions triggering events occur or if
    there has been a decline in value that may be other than
    temporary. Of our total assets, recorded at $14.246 billion
    at December 3l, 2008, 63 percent represent long-lived
    assets and investments that are subject to this type of
    analysis. We base our evaluations of impairment on such
    indicators as:

•

the nature of the assets,

•

projected future economic benefits,

•

regulatory and political environments,

•

historical and future cash flow and profitability
    measurements, and

•

other external market conditions and factors.

The estimates we use can change over time, which could have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For
    additional details, see Note 1, Corporate Structure and
    Accounting Policies, “Impairment of Investments and
    Long-Lived Assets.”

Accounting
    for the Effects of Industry Regulation

Our involvement in a regulated industry requires us to use
    SFAS No. 71 to account for the effects of the
    regulators’ decisions that impact the timing and
    recognition of our revenues and expenses. As a result, we may
    defer or recognize revenues and expenses differently than a
    non-regulated entity.

For example, we may record as regulatory assets items that a
    non-regulated entity normally would expense if the actions of
    the regulator indicate that we will recover the expenses in
    future rates. Conversely, we may record as

CE-12


Consumers
    Energy Company

regulatory liabilities items that non-regulated entities may
    normally recognize as revenues, if the actions of the regulator
    indicate that we will be required to refund the revenues to
    customers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate
    accounting for items recorded as regulatory assets and
    liabilities. At December 31, 2008, we had
    $2.438 billion recorded as regulatory assets and
    $1.988 billion recorded as regulatory liabilities.

Our PSCR and GCR cost recovery mechanisms also give rise to
    probable future revenues that will be recovered from customers
    or past overrecoveries that will be refunded to customers
    through the ratemaking process. Underrecoveries are included in
    Accrued power supply and gas revenue and overrecoveries are
    included in Accrued rate refunds on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. At December 31, 2008, we had $7 million
    recorded as regulatory assets for underrecoveries of power
    supply and gas costs and $7 million recorded as regulatory
    liabilities for overrecoveries of power supply and gas costs.

For additional details, see Note 1, Corporate Structure and
    Accounting Policies, “Utility Regulation.”

Accounting
    for Financial and Derivative Instruments and Market Risk
    Information

Financial Instruments:

Debt and equity securities
    classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value
    determined from quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and
    losses resulting from changes in fair value of
    available-for-sale debt and equity securities are reported, net
    of tax, in equity as part of AOCL. Unrealized losses are
    excluded from earnings unless the related changes in fair value
    are determined to be other than temporary.

Derivative Instruments:

We use the criteria in
    SFAS No. 133 to determine if we need to account for
    certain contracts as derivative instruments. These criteria are
    complex and often require significant judgment in applying them
    to specific contracts. If a contract is a derivative and does
    not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception under
    SFAS No. 133, we record it on our consolidated balance
    sheet at its fair value. Each quarter, we adjust the resulting
    asset or liability to reflect any change in the fair value of
    the contract, a practice known as marking the contract to
    market. For additional details on our derivatives, see
    Note 6, Financial and Derivative Instruments.

To determine the fair value of our derivatives, we generally use
    information from external sources, such as quoted market prices
    and other valuation information. Our valuations use various
    inputs and assumptions, including commodity market prices and
    volatilities, as well as interest rates and contract maturity
    dates. The fair values we calculate for our derivatives may
    change significantly as commodity prices and volatilities
    change. The cash returns we actually realize on our derivatives
    may be different from the fair values that we estimate. For
    derivatives in an asset position, our calculations of fair value
    include reserves to reflect the credit risk of our
    counterparties. For derivatives in a liability position, our
    calculations include reserves to reflect our own credit risk. At
    December 31, 2008, the amount of credit reserves we have
    recorded is immaterial. For additional details on how we
    determine the fair values of our derivatives, see Note 2,
    Fair Value Measurements.

The types of contracts we typically classify as derivatives are
    financial transmission rights, fixed price fuel contracts, and
    forward and option contracts for natural gas and foreign
    currencies. Most of our commodity purchase and sale contracts
    are not subject to derivative accounting under
    SFAS No. 133 because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units
    specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity
    or bcf of natural gas),

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales
    exception, or

•

there is not an active market for the commodity.

Our coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is
    not an active market for the coal we purchase. If an active
    market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts
    may qualify as derivatives. Under regulatory accounting, the
    resulting mark-to-market gains and losses would be offset by
    changes in regulatory assets and liabilities and would not
    affect net income.

Market Risk Information:

We are exposed to market
    risks including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates,
    commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity
    security prices. We may enter into various risk management
    contracts to limit our exposure to these risks, including swaps,
    options, and forward contracts. We enter into these contracts
    using established policies and procedures, under the direction
    of an executive oversight committee consisting of senior
    management representatives and a risk committee consisting of
    business unit managers.

These contracts contain credit risk, which is the risk that our
    counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations.
    We reduce this risk using established policies and procedures,
    such as evaluating our counterparties’ credit quality and
    setting collateral requirements as necessary. If terms permit,
    we use standard agreements that allow us to net positive and
    negative exposures associated with the same counterparty. Given
    these policies, our current exposures, and our credit reserves,
    we do not expect a material adverse effect on our financial
    position or future earnings because of counterparty
    nonperformance.

The following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss
    in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from our financial
    instruments, including our derivative contracts, assuming a
    hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices of
    10 percent. Potential losses could exceed the amounts shown
    in the sensitivity analyses if changes in market rates or prices
    were to exceed 10 percent.

Interest Rate Risk:

We are exposed to interest rate
    risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate and variable-rate
    financing instruments, and from interest rate swap agreements.
    We use a combination of these instruments to manage this risk as
    deemed appropriate, based upon market conditions. These
    strategies are designed to provide and maintain a balance
    between risk and the lowest cost of capital.

Commodity Price Risk:

Operating in the energy

    from fluctuations in the price of electricity, natural gas,
    coal, and other commodities. Commodity prices are influenced by
    a number of factors, including weather, changes in supply and
    demand, and liquidity of commodity markets. In order to manage
    commodity price risk, we may enter into various non-trading
    derivative contracts, such as fixed price fuel contracts.

Retirement
    Benefits

Pension:

We have external trust funds to provide
    retirement pension benefits to our employees under a
    non-contributory, defined benefit Pension Plan. On
    September 1, 2005, the defined benefit Pension Plan was
    closed to new participants and we implemented the qualified
    DCCP, which provides an employer contribution of five percent of
    base pay to the existing 401(k) plan. An employee contribution
    is not required to receive the plan’s employer cash
    contribution. All employees hired on or after September 1,
    2005 participate in this plan as part of their retirement
    benefit program. Previous cash balance pension plan participants
    also participate in the DCCP as of September 1, 2005.
    Additional pay credits under the cash balance pension plan were
    discontinued as of that date.

401(k):

We provide an employer match in our 401(k)
    plan equal to 60 percent on eligible contributions up to
    the first six percent of an employee’s wages.

OPEB:

We provide postretirement health and life
    benefits under our OPEB plan to qualifying retired employees.

In accordance with SFAS No. 158, we record liabilities
    for pension and OPEB on our consolidated balance sheet at the
    present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets.
    We use SFAS No. 87 to account for pension expense and
    SFAS No. 106 to account for other postretirement
    benefit expense. The calculation of the liabilities and
    associated expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and
    requires many assumptions, including:

•

life expectancies,

•

discount rates,

•

expected long-term rate of return on plan assets,

•

rate of compensation increases, and

•

anticipated health care costs.

A change in these assumptions could change significantly our
    recorded liabilities and associated expenses.

The following table provides an estimate of our pension cost,
    OPEB cost, and cash contributions for the next three years:

will depend on future investment performance, changes in future
    discount rates, and various other factors related to the
    populations participating in the Pension Plan.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the Pension
    Plan assets by 0.25 percent (from 8.25 percent to
    8.00 percent) would increase estimated pension cost for
    2009 by $3 million. Lowering the discount rate by
    0.25 percent (from 6.50 percent to 6.25 percent)
    would increase estimated pension cost for 2009 by
    $5 million.

For additional details on postretirement benefits, see
    Note 7, Retirement Benefits.

Accounting
    For Asset Retirement Obligations

We are required to record the fair value of the cost to remove
    assets at the end of their useful lives, if there is a legal
    obligation to remove them. We have legal obligations to remove
    some of our assets at the end of their useful lives. We
    calculate the fair value of ARO liabilities using an expected
    present value technique, that reflects assumptions about costs,
    inflation, and profit margin that third parties would consider
    to assume the obligation. We did not include a market risk
    premium in our ARO fair value estimates since a reasonable
    estimate could not be made.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the
    period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with
    indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Generally, our
    gas transmission and electric and gas distribution assets have
    indeterminate lives and retirement cash flows that cannot be
    determined. However, we have recorded an ARO for our obligation
    to cut, purge, and cap abandoned gas distribution mains and gas
    services at the end of their useful lives. We have not recorded
    a liability for assets that have insignificant cumulative
    disposal costs, such as substation batteries. For additional
    details, see Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations.

Related
    Party Transactions

We enter into a number of significant transactions with related
    parties. These transactions include:

•

purchase and sale of electricity from and to Enterprises,

•

payment of parent company overhead costs to CMS Energy, and

•

investment in CMS Energy Common Stock.

Transactions involving the power supply purchases from certain
    affiliates of Enterprises are based upon avoided costs under
    PURPA and competitive bidding. The payment of parent company
    overhead costs is based on the use of accepted industry
    allocation methodologies. These payments are for costs that
    generally occur in the normal course of business.

For additional details on related party transactions, see
    Note 1, Corporate Structure and Accounting Policies,
    “Related Party Transactions.”

CAPITAL RESOURCES
    AND LIQUIDITY

Factors affecting our liquidity and capital requirements include:

•

results of operations,

•

capital expenditures,

•

energy commodity and transportation costs,

•

contractual obligations,

•

regulatory decisions,

•

debt maturities,

CE-16


Consumers
    Energy Company

•

credit ratings,

•

pension plan funding requirements,

•

working capital needs,

•

collateral requirements, and

•

access to credit markets.

During the summer months, we buy natural gas and store it for
    resale during the winter heating season. Although our prudent
    natural gas costs are recoverable from our customers, the
    storage of natural gas as inventory requires additional
    liquidity due to the lag in cost recovery.

Components of our cash management plan include controlling
    operating expenses and capital expenditures and evaluating
    market conditions for financing opportunities, if needed. We
    have taken the following actions to strengthen our liquidity:

•

in September 2008, we issued $350 million FMB, and

•

in September 2008, we entered into a $150 million revolving
    credit agreement.

In April 2008, we redeemed two of our tax-exempt debt issues
    with $96 million of refinancing proceeds and converted
    $35 million of tax-exempt debt previously backed by
    municipal bond insurers to variable rate demand bonds,
    effectively eliminating our variable rate debt backed by
    municipal bond insurers.

Despite the current market volatility, we expect to be able to
    continue to have access to the capital markets, including funds
    available under our revolving credit facilities and our accounts
    receivable sales program. Our accounts receivable sales program
    is planned for renewal in May 2009. Of our $842 million in
    letters of credit and revolving credit facilities,
    $342 million are planned for renewal in 2009 and
    $500 million are planned for renewal in 2012. Our FMB
    maturities are $350 million in 2009, $250 million in
    2010 and $300 million in 2012. We believe that our current level
    of cash and our anticipated cash flows from operating
    activities, together with access to sources of liquidity, will
    be sufficient to meet cash requirements. If access to the
    capital markets is diminished or otherwise restricted, we would
    implement contingency plans to address debt maturities that may
    include reduced capital spending. For additional details, see
    Note 5, Financings and Capitalization.

Cash
    Position, Investing, and Financing

Our operating, investing, and financing activities meet
    consolidated cash needs. At December 31, 2008, we had
    $94 million of consolidated cash, which includes
    $25 million of restricted cash.

    amortization, deferred income taxes, postretirement benefits
    expense, asset impairment charges, and other non-cash charges.

2008 versus 2007:

Cash provided by operating
    activities increased primarily as a result of increased earnings
    and the timing of cash receipts from accounts receivable. We
    accelerate our collections from customer billings through the
    sale of accounts receivable. We sold $325 million of
    accounts receivable at the end of 2006, which reduced our
    collections from customers during 2007. We did not sell accounts
    receivable in 2007 and sold $170 million of accounts
    receivable during 2008. Also contributing to the increase in
    cash provided by operating activities were lower postretirement
    benefit contributions and other timing differences. These
    increases were partially offset by refunds to customers of
    excess Palisades decommissioning funds, the impact of higher
    commodity prices on inventory purchases, and increased accounts
    receivable billings at the end of 2008 due to regulatory actions
    and weather-driven demand.

2007 versus 2006:

The decrease in cash provided by
    operating activities was primarily due to the absence, in 2007,
    of the sale of accounts receivable, a payment to fund our
    Pension Plan, and refunds to customers of excess Palisades
    decommissioning funds. These decreases were partially offset by
    increased earnings, the absence, in 2007, of tax payments made
    to the parent related to the 2006 IRS income tax audit, the
    absence of the release of the MCV Partnership gas supplier funds
    on deposit due to the sale of our interest in the MCV
    Partnership in 2006, a decrease in expenditures for gas
    inventory as the milder winter in 2006 allowed us to accumulate
    more gas in our storage facilities and other timing differences.

    capital expenditures resulting from the absence of the Zeeland
    power plant purchase made in 2007.

2007 versus 2006:

The increase in net cash provided
    by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in
    contributions from the parent and a decrease in retirement of
    long-term debt. These changes were partially offset by an
    increase in common stock dividend payments.

    make monthly capacity payments based on the plants’
    availability or deliverability. These payments will approximate
    $40 million per month during 2009. If a plant is not
    available to deliver electricity, we will not be obligated to
    make these payments for that period. For additional details on

Off-Balance

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

We enter into
    various arrangements in the normal course of business to
    facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These
    arrangements include indemnifications, surety bonds, letters of
    credit, and financial and performance guarantees.
    Indemnifications are usually agreements to reimburse a
    counterparty that may incur losses due to outside claims or
    breach of contract terms. The maximum payment we would be
    required to make under a number of these indemnities is not
    estimable. While we believe it is unlikely that we will incur
    any material losses related to indemnifications we have not
    recorded as liabilities, we cannot predict the impact of these
    contingent obligations on our liquidity and financial condition.
    For additional details on these arrangements, see Note 4,

    review these estimates and may revise them, periodically, due to
    a number of factors including environmental regulations,
    business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and
    the ability to access capital. The following is a summary of our

OUTLOOK

Corporate
    Outlook

Our business strategy will focus on continuing to invest in our
    utility system to enable us to meet our customer commitments, to
    comply with increasingly demanding environmental performance
    standards, to improve system performance, and to maintain
    adequate supply and capacity.

ELECTRIC
    BUSINESS OUTLOOK

Balanced Energy Initiative:

Our Balanced Energy
    Initiative is a comprehensive energy resource plan to meet our
    projected short-term and long-term electric power requirements
    through:

•

energy efficiency,

•

demand management,

•

expanded use of renewable energy, and

•

development of new power plants and pursuit of additional power
    purchase agreements to complement existing generating sources.

Our Balanced Energy Initiative includes our plan to build an
    800 MW advanced clean coal-based plant at our Karn/Weadock
    Generating complex near Bay City, Michigan. We expect the plant
    to be in operation in 2017. Legislation enacted in Michigan in
    October 2008 provided guidelines with respect to the MPSC review
    and approval of energy resource plans and proposed power plants.
    We plan to file a new case with the MPSC that conforms to the
    new legislation.

Proposed Coal Plant Projects:

In February 2009, the
    Michigan governor issued an executive directive that set forth
    additional requirements for the issuance of a permit to install
    a coal-based electric generating plant in the state of Michigan.
    The directive requires the MDEQ, before issuing an air permit
    for any coal-based electric generating plant, to consider, among
    other things,

•

whether additional generation is needed, and

•

whether other feasible and prudent alternatives to a new coal
    plant exist that would better protect the environment, including
    potential demand reduction measures and purchasing power from
    existing sources.

We are examining the legality of the directive, as well as its
    impact on our existing air permit application for our planned
    advanced clean coal plant. The Michigan attorney general issued
    an opinion that invalidated the governor’s directive on the
    basis that the governor’s directive exceeded the
    governor’s authority.

In February 2009, the Michigan governor also proposed a 45
    percent reduction in the use of fossil fuel for electric
    generation by 2020. The governor’s office has subsequently
    advised us that the 45 percent is only a suggested target, and
    is intended to apply only to coal-based generation. If
    implemented, it will have a significant impact upon the
    operation and cost of existing and planned future coal-based
    power plants.

We cannot predict the impact of the governor’s statements
    or other factors on our future power supply plans.

Electric Customer Revenue Outlook:

Michigan’s
    economy has suffered from closures and restructuring of
    automotive manufacturing facilities and those of related
    suppliers and from the depressed housing market. The Michigan
    economy also has been harmed by the current volatility in the
    credit markets. Although our electric utility results are not
    dependent substantially upon a single customer, or even a few
    customers, those in the automotive sector represented four
    percent of our total 2008 electric revenue and two and a half
    percent of our 2008 electric operating income. We cannot predict
    the financial impact of the Michigan economy on our electric
    customer revenue.

Electric Deliveries:

We experienced a decrease in
    electric deliveries of approximately 3.5 percent in 2008
    compared with 2007, or 2.0 percent excluding impacts from
    differences in weather. This decrease reflects a decline

CE-22


Consumers
    Energy Company

in industrial economic activity and the cancellation of one
    wholesale customer contract. For 2009, we expect a decrease in
    electric deliveries of 2.5 percent compared with 2008, or
    2.1 percent excluding impacts from differences in weather.
    Our outlook for 2009 includes continuing growth in deliveries to
    our largest-growing customer, which produces semiconductor and
    solar energy components. Excluding this customer’s growth,
    we expect electric deliveries in 2009 to decline
    3.4 percent compared with 2008 or 3.0 percent
    excluding impacts from differences in weather. Our outlook
    reflects reduced deliveries associated with our investment in
    energy efficiency programs included in the recently enacted
    legislation, as well as recent projections of Michigan economic
    conditions.

After 2009, we anticipate economic conditions to stabilize,
    resulting in modestly growing deliveries of electricity. We
    expect deliveries to grow on average about 0.8 percent
    annually over the period from 2009 to 2014. This growth rate
    also includes expected results of energy efficiency programs and
    both full-service sales and delivery service to customers who
    choose to buy generation service from an alternative electric
    supplier, but transactions with other wholesale market
    participants are not included. Actual growth may vary from this
    trend due to the following:

•

energy conservation measures and results of energy efficiency
    programs,

•

fluctuations in weather, and

•

changes in economic conditions, including utilization and
    expansion or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population
    trends, and housing activity.

Electric Reserve Margin:

To reduce the risk of high
    power supply costs during peak demand periods and to achieve our
    Reserve Margin target, we purchase electric capacity and energy
    for the physical delivery of electricity primarily in the summer
    months. We are currently planning for a Reserve Margin of
    12.7 percent for summer 2009, or supply resources equal to
    112.7 percent of projected firm summer peak load. We have
    purchased capacity and energy covering our Reserve Margin
    requirements for 2009 through 2010. Of the 2009 supply resources
    target, we expect 96.4 percent to come from our electric
    generating plants and long-term power purchase contracts, with
    other capacity and energy contractual arrangements making up the
    remainder. We expect capacity costs for these electric capacity
    and energy contractual arrangements to be $15 million for
    2009.

Electric Transmission Expenses:

We expect the
    transmission charges we incur to increase by $55 million in
    2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a 25 percent
    increase in METC and Wolverine transmission rates. This increase
    was included in our 2009 PSCR plan filed with the MPSC in
    September 2008.

The MPSC issued an order that allowed transmission expenses to
    be included in the PSCR process. The Attorney General appealed
    the MPSC order to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which affirmed
    the MPSC order. The Attorney General filed an application for
    leave to appeal with the Michigan Supreme Court, which was
    granted in September 2008. We cannot predict the financial
    impact or outcome of this matter.

For additional details on the electric transmission expense
    litigation, see Note 4, Contingencies, “Electric
    Contingencies — Litigation.”

Renewable Energy Plan:

Legislation enacted in
    Michigan in October 2008 prescribed renewable energy standards
    for energy and capacity. The energy standard requires that
    10 percent of our electric sales volume come from renewable
    sources by 2015 with interim target requirements. Approximately
    four percent of our electric sales volume comes presently from
    renewable sources. The legislation also requires us to add new
    renewable energy capacity of 200 MW by year-end 2013 and
    500 MW by year-end 2015, from owned renewable energy
    sources or power purchased agreements. We have secured more than
    36,000 acres of land easements in Michigan’s Tuscola
    and Mason counties for potential wind generation development and
    we are collecting presently wind speed and other meteorological
    data at the sites.

In February 2009, we filed our Renewable Energy Plan with the
    MPSC. The plan details how we will meet the renewable energy
    standards for energy and capacity.

Energy Optimization Plan:

Legislation enacted in
    Michigan in October 2008 requires utilities to prepare energy
    optimization plans and achieve annual sales reduction targets
    beginning in 2009 through 2015. In February 2009, we filed our
    Energy Optimization Plan with the MPSC, which details our
    proposed energy cost savings plan through incentives to reduce
    customer usage among all customer classes and the method of
    recovery of program costs.

Ancillary Services:

In January 2009, MISO
    implemented an ancillary services market for the purchase and
    sale of regulation and contingency reserves. We include
    ancillary service costs in our PSCR.

ELECTRIC
    BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES

Several electric business trends and uncertainties may affect
    our financial condition and future results of operations. These
    trends and uncertainties could have a material impact on
    revenues and income from continuing electric operations.

Electric Environmental Estimates:

Our operations are
    subject to various state and federal environmental laws and
    regulations. Generally, we have been able to recover in customer
    rates our costs to operate our facilities in compliance with
    these laws and regulations.

Clean Air Act:

We continue to focus on complying
    with the federal Clean Air Act and numerous state and federal
    regulations. We plan to spend $817 million for equipment
    installation through 2017 to comply with a number of
    environmental regulations, including regulations limiting
    nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions. We expect to
    recover these costs in customer rates.

We plan to purchase additional nitrogen oxides emission
    allowances through 2010 at an estimated cost of $5 million
    per year. We also plan to purchase sulfur dioxide emission
    allowances, between 2013 and 2015, at an estimated cost ranging
    from $9 million to $27 million per year. We expect to
    recover emissions allowance costs from our customers through the
    PSCR process.

Clean Air Interstate Rule:

In March 2005, the EPA
    adopted the CAIR, which required additional coal-based electric
    generating plant emission controls for nitrogen oxides and
    sulfur dioxide. The CAIR was appealed to the U.S. Court of
    Appeals for the District of Columbia. The court initially
    vacated the CAIR and the CAIR federal implementation plan in
    their entirety, but subsequently, the court changed course and
    remanded the rule to the EPA maintaining the rule in effect
    pending EPA revision. As a result, the CAIR still remains in
    effect, with the first annual nitrogen oxides compliance year
    beginning January 1, 2009. The EPA must now revise the rule
    to resolve the court’s concerns. The court did not set a
    timetable for the revision.

State and Federal Mercury Air Rules:

In March 2005,
    the EPA issued the CAMR, which required initial reductions of
    mercury emissions from coal-based electric generating plants by
    2010 and further reductions by 2018. A number of states and
    other entities appealed certain portions of the CAMR to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia decided
    the case in February 2008, and determined that the rules
    developed by the EPA were not consistent with the Clean Air Act.
    The U.S. Supreme Court has been petitioned to review this
    decision.

In April 2006, Michigan’s governor proposed a plan that
    would result in mercury emissions reductions of 90 percent
    by 2015. The MDEQ is reviewing public comments made in response
    to a newly released mercury emissions reduction proposal. If
    this plan becomes effective, we estimate that the associated
    costs will be approximately $782 million by 2015.

Routine Maintenance Classification:

The EPA has
    alleged that some utilities have incorrectly classified major
    plant modifications as RMRR rather than seeking permits from the
    EPA to modify their plants. We responded to information requests
    from the EPA on this subject in 2000, 2002, and 2006. We believe
    that we have properly interpreted the requirements of RMRR. In
    October 2008, we received another information request from the
    EPA under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act. We responded to
    this information request in December 2008.

CE-24


Consumers
    Energy Company

In addition to the EPA’s information request, in October
    2008, we received a NOV for three of our coal-based facilities
    relating to violations of NSR regulations, alleging ten projects
    from 1986 to 1998 were subject to NSR review. We met with the
    EPA in January 2009 and have additional meetings scheduled. If
    the EPA does not accept our interpretation of RMRR, we could be
    required to install additional pollution control equipment at
    some or all of our coal-based electric generating plants,
    surrender emission allowances, engage in supplemental
    environmental programs or pay fines. Additionally, we would need
    to assess the viability of continuing operations at certain
    plants. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    this matter.

Greenhouse Gases:

The United States Congress has
    introduced proposals that would require reductions in emissions
    of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. We consider it
    likely that Congress will enact greenhouse gas legislation, but
    the form of any final bill is difficult to predict. These laws,
    or similar state laws or rules, if enacted, could require us to
    replace equipment, install additional equipment for emission
    controls, purchase allowances, curtail operations, arrange for
    alternative sources of supply, or take other steps to manage or
    lower the emission of greenhouse gases. Although associated
    capital or operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation
    or legislation could be material, and cost recovery cannot be
    assured, we expect to have an opportunity to recover these costs
    and capital expenditures in rates consistent with the recovery
    of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws
    and regulations.

In July 2008, the EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed
    Rulemaking to present possible options for regulating greenhouse
    gases under the Clean Air Act, as well as to solicit comments
    and additional ideas. We submitted comments to the EPA on this
    issue in November 2008. In addition to the potential for federal
    actions related to greenhouse gas regulation, the State of
    Michigan has convened the Michigan Climate Action Council, a
    climate change stakeholder process. Michigan is also a signatory
    participant in the Midwest Governors Greenhouse Gas Reduction
    Accord process. We cannot predict the extent or the likelihood
    of any actions that could result from these state and regional
    processes.

Water:

In July 2004, the EPA issued rules that
    govern existing electric generating plant cooling water intake
    systems. These rules require a significant reduction in the
    number of fish harmed by intake structures at existing power
    plants. The EPA compliance options in the rule were challenged
    before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
    which remanded the bulk of the rule back to the EPA for
    reconsideration in January 2007. In April 2008, the
    U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an industry challenge to
    the appellate court ruling in this case. A decision from the U.S
    Supreme Court is expected in the first half of 2009. The EPA is
    planning to issue a revised draft rule in 2009, following the
    court decision.

We estimate that capital expenditures to comply with these
    regulations will be approximately $128 million; however an
    unfavorable U.S. Supreme Court decision could increase
    expenditures significantly.

We will continue to monitor these developments and respond to
    their potential implications for our business, consolidated
    results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. For
    additional details on electric environmental matters, see
    Note 4, Contingencies, “Electric
    Contingencies — Electric Environmental Matters.”

Stranded Cost Recovery:

In October 2008, the
    Michigan legislature enacted legislation that amended the
    Customer Choice Act and directed the MPSC to approve rates that
    will allow recovery of Stranded Costs within five years. In
    January 2009, we filed an application with the MPSC requesting
    recovery of these Stranded Costs through a surcharge on both
    full service and ROA customers. At December 31, 2008, we
    had a regulatory asset for Stranded Costs of $71 million.

Electric Rate Case:

In November 2008, we filed an
    application with the MPSC seeking an annual increase in revenue
    of $214 million based on an 11 percent authorized
    return on equity. The filing seeks recovery of costs associated
    with new plant investments including Clean Air Act investments,
    higher operating and maintenance costs, and the approval to
    recover costs associated with our advanced metering
    infrastructure program. The Michigan legislation enacted in
    October 2008 generally allows utilities to self-implement rates
    six months after filing, subject to refund, unless the MPSC
    finds good cause to prohibit such self-implementation. We cannot
    predict the financial impact or outcome of this proceeding.

Palisades Regulatory Proceedings:

We sold Palisades
    to Entergy in April 2007. The MPSC order approving the
    transaction required that we credit $255 million of excess
    sale proceeds and decommissioning amounts to our retail
    customers by December 2008. There are additional excess sales
    proceeds and decommissioning fund balances of $109 million
    above the amount in the MPSC order. The distribution of these
    funds is still pending with the MPSC.

For additional details on electric rate matters, see
    Note 4, Contingencies, “Electric Rate Matters.”

GAS
    BUSINESS OUTLOOK

Gas Deliveries:

For 2009, we expect gas deliveries
    to decrease by 3.4 percent compared with 2008, or
    4.7 percent, excluding impacts from differences in weather,
    due to continuing conservation and overall economic conditions
    in Michigan. We expect gas deliveries to average a decline of
    less than 1.6 percent annually over the next five years.
    Actual delivery levels from year to year may vary from this
    trend due to the following:

•

fluctuations in weather,

•

use by independent power producers,

•

availability and development of renewable energy sources,

•

changes in gas prices,

•

Michigan economic conditions including population trends and
    housing activity,

•

the price of competing energy sources or fuels, and

•

energy efficiency and conservation.

GAS
    BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES

Several gas business trends and uncertainties may affect our
    future financial results and financial condition. These trends
    and uncertainties could have a material impact on future
    revenues and income from gas operations.

Gas Environmental Estimates:

We expect to incur
    investigation and remedial action costs at a number of sites,
    including 23 former manufactured gas plant sites. For additional
    details, see Note 4, Contingencies, “Gas Contingencies
    - Gas Environmental Matters.”

Gas Cost Recovery:

The GCR process is designed to
    allow us to recover all of our purchased natural gas costs if
    incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.
    The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices for
    prudence in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. For
    additional details on GCR, see Note 4, Contingencies,
    “Gas Rate Matters — Gas Cost Recovery.”

Gas Depreciation:

On August 1, 2008, we filed a
    gas depreciation case using 2007 data with the MPSC-ordered
    variations on traditional cost-of-removal methodologies. In
    December 2008, the MPSC approved a partial settlement agreement
    allowing us to implement the filed depreciation rates, on an
    interim basis, concurrent with the implementation of settled
    rates in our 2008 gas rate case. The interim depreciation rates
    reduce our depreciation expense by approximately
    $20 million per year and will remain in effect until a
    final order is issued in our gas depreciation case. If a final
    order in our gas depreciation case is not issued concurrently
    with a final order in a general gas rate case, the MPSC may
    incorporate the results of the depreciation case into general
    gas rates through a surcharge, which may be either positive or
    negative.

Lost and Unaccounted for Gas:

Gas utilities
    typically lose a portion of gas as it is injected into and
    withdrawn from storage and sent through transmission and
    distribution systems. We recover the cost of lost and
    unaccounted for gas through general rate cases, which have
    traditionally provided for recovery based on an average of the
    previous five years of actual losses. To the extent that we
    experience lost and unaccounted for gas that exceeds the
    previous five-year average, we may be unable to recover these
    amounts in rates.

OTHER
    OUTLOOK

Advanced Metering Infrastructure:

We are developing
    an advanced metering system that will provide enhanced controls
    and information about our customer energy usage and notification
    of service interruptions. The system also will allow customers
    to make decisions about energy efficiency and conservation,
    provide other customer benefits, and reduce costs. We expect to
    develop integration software and pilot new technology over the
    next two to three years, and incur capital expenditures of
    approximately $800 million over the next seven years for
    the full deployment of these “smart meters.”

Emergency Shutoff Protection Rules:

In February
    2009, the MPSC issued rules that would put additional emergency
    shutoff protections and service limitation protections in place
    for our residential electric and natural gas customers. The
    protection exceeds previous shutoff rules as follows:

•

extends the protection period from March 31, 2009 to
    April 30, 2009,

•

includes protection for physically or mentally disabled
    customers of record,

•

expands the qualifications for low income shutoff protection, and

•

gives customers the payment options.

We are presently evaluating the impacts of these rules on our
    cash flows and financial position.

Litigation and Regulatory Investigation:

We are a
    party to certain lawsuits and administrative proceedings before
    various courts and governmental agencies arising from the
    ordinary course of business.

For additional details regarding these lawsuits and proceedings,
    see Note 4, Contingencies and Part I, Item 3.

Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 —
    Mark-to-Market Accounting:

In October 2008, President
    Bush signed into law a $700 billion economic recovery plan.
    The plan included a provision authorizing the SEC to suspend the
    application of SFAS No. 157 for any issuer with
    respect to any class or category of transaction as deemed
    necessary. In addition, the SEC was required to conduct a study
    on mark-to-market accounting (fair value accounting), including
    its possible impacts on recent bank failures, along with a
    consideration of alternative accounting treatments. In late
    December 2008, the SEC submitted a report on its study to
    Congress. The report concluded that mark-to-market accounting
    was not a major factor in recent bank failures, and recommended
    that existing fair value and mark-to-market accounting
    requirements remain in place. The report included
    recommendations for improving fair value accounting and
    reporting. We apply this accounting primarily to our investment
    in CMS Energy Common Stock and our SERP investments, and we will
    continue to monitor developments relating to the SEC report,
    including reactions and responses to the report’s
    recommendations, for potential impact to us.

IMPLEMENTATION OF
    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements:

This standard, which was effective
    for us January 1, 2008, defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. The implementation of this
    standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated
    financial statements. For additional details on our fair value
    measurements, see Note 2, Fair Value Measurements.

SEC /

FASB Guidance on Fair Value
    Measurements:

In September 2008, in response to
    concerns about fair value accounting and its possible role in
    the recent declines in the financial markets, the SEC Office of
    the Chief Accountant and the FASB staff jointly released
    additional guidance on fair value measurements. The guidance,
    which was effective for us upon issuance, did not change or
    conflict with the fair value principles in
    SFAS No. 157, but rather provided further
    clarification on how to value a financial asset in an illiquid
    market. This guidance had no impact on our fair value
    measurements.

    application of SFAS No. 157 in measuring financial
    assets in illiquid markets and is consistent with the guidance
    issued by the SEC and the FASB as discussed in the preceding
    paragraph, but an example is provided to illustrate the

In September 2006, the FASB
    issued SFAS No. 158. Phase one of this standard,
    implemented in December 2006, required us to recognize the
    funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006. Phase
    two, implemented in January 2008, required us to change our plan
    measurement date from November 30 to December 31, effective
    for the year ending December 31, 2008. For additional
    details, see Note 7, Retirement Benefits.

SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an
    amendment to FASB Statement No. 115:

This
    standard, which was effective for us January 1, 2008, gives
    us the option to measure certain financial instruments and other
    items at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in
    earnings. We have not elected the fair value option for any
    financial instruments or other items.

    income tax benefit realized from dividends or dividend
    equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and paid to
    employees for non-vested equity-classified employee share-based

    statements. For additional details on our guarantees, see
    Note 4, Contingencies.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET EFFECTIVE

SFAS No. 141(R),

Business
    Combinations:

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 141(R), which replaces
    SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

.
    SFAS No. 141(R) establishes how an acquiring entity
    should measure and recognize assets acquired, liabilities
    assumed, and noncontrolling interests acquired through a
    business combination. The standard also establishes how goodwill
    or gains from bargain purchases should be measured and
    recognized, and what information the acquirer should disclose to
    enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature
    and financial effects of a business combination. Costs of an
    acquisition are to be recognized separately from the business
    combination. We will apply SFAS No. 141(R)
    prospectively to any business combination for which the date of
    acquisition is on or after January 1, 2009.

SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment to

    Under this standard, ownership interests in subsidiaries held by
    third parties, which are currently referred to as minority
    interests, will be presented as noncontrolling interests and
    shown separately on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within
    equity. In addition, net income attributable to noncontrolling
    interests will be included in net income on our Consolidated
    Statements of Income. These changes involve presentation only,

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1: CORPORATE
    STRUCTURE AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Corporate Structure:

Consumers, a subsidiary of CMS
    Energy, a holding company, is a combination electric and gas
    utility company serving Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Our
    customer base includes a mix of residential, commercial, and
    diversified industrial customers. We manage our business by the
    nature of service provided and operate principally in two
    business segments: electric utility and gas utility.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated
    financial statements comprise Consumers and all other entities
    in which we have a controlling financial interest or are the
    primary beneficiary, in accordance with FIN 46(R). We use
    the equity method of accounting for investments in companies and
    partnerships that are not consolidated, where we have
    significant influence over operations and financial policies,
    but are not the primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany
    transactions and balances.

Use of Estimates:

We prepare our consolidated
    financial statements in conformity with GAAP. We are required to
    make estimates using assumptions that may affect the reported
    amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

We record estimated liabilities for contingencies in our
    consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred and when the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. For additional details, see Note 4,
    Contingencies.

Revenue Recognition Policy:

We recognize revenues
    from deliveries of electricity and natural gas, and from the
    storage of natural gas when services are provided. We record
    unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energy delivered
    to customers but not yet billed. Unbilled revenues are estimated
    by applying an average billed rate for each customer class based
    on actual billed volume distributions. Our unbilled revenues,
    which are recorded as Accounts receivable on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets, were $507 million at December 31, 2008
    and $490 million at December 31, 2007. We record sales
    tax on a net basis and exclude it from revenues.

Accounting for Legal Fees:

We expense legal fees as
    incurred; fees incurred but not yet billed are accrued based on
    estimates of work performed. This policy also applies to fees
    incurred on behalf of employees and officers related to
    indemnification agreements; these fees are billed directly to us.

Accounting for MISO Transactions:

MISO requires that
    we submit hourly day-ahead and real-time bids and offers for
    energy at locations across the MISO region. We account for MISO
    transactions on a net hourly basis in each of the real-time and
    day-ahead markets, and net transactions across all MISO energy
    market locations. We record net purchases in a single hour in
    “Purchased and interchange power” and net sales in a
    single hour in “Operating Revenue” in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. We record expense accruals for future net
    purchases adjustments based on historical experience, and
    reconcile accruals to actual expenses when we receive invoices.

Capitalized Interest:

We capitalize interest on
    certain qualifying assets that are undergoing activities to
    prepare them for their intended use. Capitalization of interest
    is limited to the actual interest cost incurred. Our regulated
    businesses capitalize AFUDC on regulated construction projects
    and include these amounts in plant in service.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents
    include short-term, highly-liquid investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Collective Bargaining Agreements:

At
    December 31, 2008, the Union represented approximately
    45 percent of our employees. The Union represents
    Consumers’ operating, maintenance, and construction
    employees and our call center employees.

CE-39


CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Determination of Pension and OPEB MRV of Plan
    Assets:

We determine the MRV for pension plan assets,
    as defined in SFAS No. 87, as the fair value of plan
    assets on the measurement date, adjusted by the gains or losses
    that will not be admitted into MRV until future years. We
    reflect each year’s assets gain or loss in MRV in equal
    amounts over a five-year period beginning on the date the
    original amount was determined. We determine the MRV for OPEB
    plan assets, as defined in SFAS No. 106, as the fair
    value of assets on the measurement date. We use the MRV in the
    calculation of net pension and OPEB costs.

Financial and Derivative Instruments:

We record debt
    and equity securities classified as available-for-sale at fair
    value determined primarily from quoted market prices. On a
    specific identification basis, we report unrealized gains and
    losses from changes in fair value of certain available-for-sale
    debt and equity securities, net of tax, in equity as part of
    AOCL. We exclude unrealized losses from earnings unless the
    related changes in fair value are determined to be other than
    temporary.

In accordance with SFAS No. 133, if a contract is a
    derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and
    sales exception, we record it on our Consolidated Balance Sheets
    at its fair value. If a derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge
    accounting, we report changes in its fair value in AOCL;
    otherwise, we report the changes in earnings.

For additional details regarding financial and derivative
    instruments, see Note 6, Financial and Derivative
    Instruments.

Impairment of Investments and Long-Lived Assets:

We
    perform tests of impairment if certain triggering events occur,
    or if there has been a decline in value that may be other than
    temporary.

We evaluate our long-lived assets

held-in-use

for impairment by calculating the undiscounted future cash flows
    expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
    disposition. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than
    the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss equal to
    the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.
    We estimate the fair value of the asset using quoted market
    prices, market prices of similar assets, or discounted future
    cash flow analyses.

We also assess our investments for impairment whenever there has
    been a decline in value that is other than temporary. This
    assessment requires us to determine the fair values of our
    investments. We determine fair value using valuation
    methodologies, including discounted cash flows and the ability
    of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies
    the carrying amount of the investment. We record an impairment
    if the fair value is less than the carrying value and the
    decline in value is considered to be other than temporary.

For additional details, see Note 3, Asset Sales and
    Impairment Charges.

Inventory:

We use the weighted average cost method
    for valuing working gas and recoverable cushion gas in
    underground storage facilities and materials and supplies
    inventory. We also use this method for valuing coal inventory
    and classify these costs as generating plant fuel stock on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We classify emission allowances as materials and supplies
    inventory and use the average cost method to remove amounts from
    inventory as we use the emission allowances to generate power.

Maintenance and Depreciation:

We charge property
    repairs and minor property replacement to maintenance expense.
    We use the direct expense method to account for planned major
    maintenance activities. We charge planned major maintenance
    activities to operating expense unless the cost represents the
    acquisition of additional components or the replacement of an
    existing component. We capitalize the cost of plant additions
    and replacements.

We depreciate utility property using a composite method, in
    which we apply a single MPSC-approved depreciation rate to the
    gross investment in a particular class of property within the
    electric and gas divisions. We

CE-40


CONSUMERS ENERGY

perform depreciation studies periodically to determine
    appropriate group lives. The composite depreciation rates for
    our properties are as follows:

Property, Plant, and Equipment:

We record property,
    plant, and equipment at original cost when placed into service.
    When utility property is retired, or otherwise disposed of in
    the ordinary course of business, we charge the original cost to
    accumulated depreciation, along with associated cost of removal,
    net of salvage. We recognize gains or losses on the retirement
    or disposal of non-regulated assets in income. Our internal-use
    computer software costs are capitalized or expensed in
    accordance with Statement of

Position 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use.

For additional details, see
    Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations and Note 12,
    Property, Plant, and Equipment. Cost of removal collected from
    our customers, but not spent, is recorded as a regulatory
    liability.

We capitalize AFUDC on regulated major construction projects.
    AFUDC represents the estimated cost of debt and a reasonable
    return on equity funds used to finance construction additions.
    We record the offsetting credit as a reduction of interest for
    the amount representing the borrowed funds component and as
    other income for the equity funds component in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. When construction is completed and the
    property is

CONSUMERS ENERGY

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

placed in service, we depreciate and recover the capitalized
    AFUDC from our customers over the life of the related asset. The
    following table shows our electric, gas and common composite
    AFUDC capitalization rates:

Property Taxes:

Property taxes are based upon the
    taxable value of Consumers’ real and personal property
    assessed by local units of government within the State of
    Michigan. We record property tax expense ratably over the fiscal
    year of the taxing authority for which the taxes are levied
    based on budgeted customer sales. The deferred property tax
    balance represents the amount of accrued property tax, which
    will be recognized over future governmental fiscal periods.

Reclassifications:

We have reclassified certain
    prior-period amounts on our Consolidated Financial Statements to
    conform to the presentation for the current period. These
    reclassifications did not affect consolidated net income or cash
    flow for the periods presented.

    fair value of $19 million at December 31, 2008. For
    additional details on our investment in CMS Energy Common Stock,
    see Note 6, Financial and Derivative Instruments.

Restricted Cash:

We classify restricted cash
    dedicated for repayment of Securitization bonds as a current
    asset, as the related payments occur within one year.

Trade Receivables:

Accounts receivable is primarily
    composed of trade receivables and unbilled receivables. We
    record our accounts receivable at cost which approximates fair
    value. We establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts
    based on historical losses and management’s assessment of
    existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other
    factors. We assess late payment fees on trade receivables based
    on contractual past-due terms established with customers. We
    charge accounts deemed uncollectible to operating expense.

Unamortized Debt Premium, Discount, and Expense:

We
    capitalize premiums, discounts, and issuance costs of long-term
    debt and amortize those costs over the terms of the debt issues.
    For the non-regulated portions of our businesses, we expense any
    refinancing costs as incurred. For the regulated portions of our
    businesses, if we refinance debt, we capitalize any remaining
    unamortized premiums, discounts, and issuance costs and amortize
    them over the terms of the newly issued debt.

Utility Regulation:

We are subject to the actions of
    the MPSC and the FERC and prepare our consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 71. As a result, we may defer or recognize
    revenues and expenses differently than a non-regulated entity.
    For example, we may record as regulatory assets items that a
    non-regulated entity normally would expense if the actions of
    the regulator indicate that we will recover the expenses in
    future rates. Conversely, we may record as regulatory
    liabilities items that non-regulated entities may normally
    recognize as revenues if the actions of the regulator indicate
    that we will be required to refund revenues to customers.

We reflect the following regulatory assets and liabilities,
    which include both current and non-current amounts, on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

    sale of sulfur dioxide allowances and AFUDC collected in excess
    of the MPSC-approved amount.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we classified
    $19 million of regulatory assets as current regulatory
    assets. At December 31, 2008, we classified
    $120 million of regulatory liabilities as current

The MPSC order approving the Palisades and Big Rock ISFSI sale
    transaction required that we credit $255 million of excess
    sales proceeds and decommissioning amounts to our retail
    customers by December 2008. For 2007, the current portion of
    regulatory liabilities for Palisades refunds represents the
    remaining portion of this obligation, plus interest. There are
    additional excess sales proceeds and decommissioning fund
    balances above the amount in the MPSC order. For 2007, the
    non-current portion of regulatory liabilities for Palisades
    refunds represents this obligation, plus interest. For 2008,
    these additional excess sales proceeds are reported in the
    current portion of regulatory liabilities for Palisades refunds
    as it is probable the proceeds will be credited to customers
    within one year. For additional details, see Note 4,
    Contingencies, “Electric Rate Matters.”

Our PSCR and GCR cost recovery mechanisms also represent
    probable future revenues that will be recovered from customers
    or previously collected revenues that will be refunded to
    customers through the ratemaking process. Underrecoveries are
    included in Accrued power supply and gas revenue and
    overrecoveries are included in Accrued rate refunds on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional details on PSCR, see

New Accounting Standards Not Yet
    Effective:

SFAS No. 141(R), Business
    Combinations:

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 141(R), which replaces
    SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

.
    SFAS No. 141(R) establishes how an acquiring entity
    should measure and recognize assets acquired, liabilities
    assumed, and noncontrolling interests acquired through a
    business combination. The standard also establishes how goodwill
    or gains from bargain purchases should be measured and
    recognized and what information the acquirer should disclose to
    enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature
    and financial effects of a business combination. Costs of an
    acquisition are to be recognized separately from the business
    combination. We will apply SFAS No. 141(R)
    prospectively to any business combination for which the date of
    acquisition is on or after January 1, 2009.

SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment to
    ARB No. 51:

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 160, effective for us January 1, 2009.
    Under this standard, ownership interests in subsidiaries held by
    third parties, which are currently referred to as minority
    interests, will be presented as noncontrolling interests and
    shown separately on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within
    equity. In addition, net income attributable to noncontrolling
    interests will be included in net income on our Consolidated
    Statements of Income. These changes involve presentation only,
    and will not otherwise impact our consolidated financial
    statements. The standard will also affect the accounting for
    changes in a parent’s ownership interest, including
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. We will apply these provisions
    of SFAS No. 160 prospectively to any such transactions.

SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative

    Statement No. 133:

In March 2008, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 161, effective for us January 1, 2009.
    This standard requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures
    about how and why derivatives are used, how derivatives and
    related hedged items are accounted for under
    SFAS No. 133, and how derivatives and related hedged
    items affect the entity’s financial position, financial

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets:

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 142-3,

effective for us January 1, 2009. This standard amends
    SFAS No. 142 to require expanded consideration of
    expected future renewals or extensions of intangible assets when
    determining their useful lives. This standard will be applied
    prospectively for intangible assets acquired after the effective
    date. This standard will not have a material impact on our

EITF Issue

Issuer’s Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
    with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement:

In September
    2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

08-5,

effective for us January 1, 2009. This guidance concludes
    that the fair value measurement of a liability should not
    consider the effect of a third-party credit enhancement or
    guarantee supporting the liability. The fair value of the
    liability should thus reflect the credit standing of the issuer
    and should not be adjusted to reflect the credit standing of a
    third-party guarantor. The standard is to be applied
    prospectively. This standard will not have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

FSP FAS 132(R)-1, Employers’ Disclosures about
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets:

In December 2008,
    the FASB issued this standard, effective for us for the year
    ending December 31, 2009. The standard requires expanded
    annual disclosures about the plan assets in our defined benefit
    pension and OPEB plans. The required disclosures include
    information about investment allocation decisions, major
    categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques
    used in the fair value measurements, the effects of significant
    unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets, and significant
    concentrations of risk within plan assets. The standard involves
    disclosures only, and will not impact our consolidated income,
    cash flows, or financial position.

2: FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

SFAS No. 157, which became effective January 1,
    2008, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. It does not require any new fair value
    measurements, but applies to those fair value measurements
    recorded or disclosed under other accounting standards. The
    standard defines fair value as the price that would be received
    to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    exchange between market participants, and requires that fair
    value measurements incorporate all assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing an asset or liability,
    including assumptions about risk. The standard also eliminates
    the prohibition against recognizing “day one” gains
    and losses on derivative instruments. We did not hold any
    derivatives with “day one” gains or losses during the
    year ended December 31, 2008. The standard is to be applied
    prospectively, except that limited retrospective application is
    required for three types of financial instruments, none of which
    we held during the year ended December 31, 2008.

SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    prioritizes inputs used to measure fair value according to their
    observability in the market. The three levels of the fair value
    hierarchy are as follows:

•

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities. These markets must
    be accessible to us at the measurement date.

•

Level 2 inputs are observable, market-based inputs, other
    than Level 1 prices. Level 2 inputs may include quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
    quoted prices in inactive markets, interest

CE-45


CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals,
    credit risks, default rates, and inputs derived from or
    corroborated by observable market data.

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect our own
    assumptions about how market participants would value our assets
    and liabilities.

To the extent possible, we use quoted market prices or other
    observable market pricing data in valuing assets and liabilities
    measured at fair value under SFAS No. 157. If this
    information is unavailable, we use market-corroborated data or
    reasonable estimates about market participant assumptions. We
    classify fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy
    based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
    fair value measurement in its entirety.

The FASB issued a one-year deferral of SFAS No. 157
    for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are
    recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. Under
    this partial deferral, SFAS No. 157 became effective
    on January 1, 2009 for fair value measurements in the
    following areas:

•

AROs,

•

most of the nonfinancial assets and liabilities acquired in a
    business combination, and

•

impairment analyses performed for nonfinancial assets.

SFAS No. 157 was effective January 1, 2008 for
    our available-for-sale investment securities, nonqualified
    deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities, derivative
    instruments, and the financial instruments disclosed in
    Note 6, Financial and Derivative Instruments,
    “Financial Instruments.” SFAS No. 157 also
    applied to the year-end measurement of fair values of our
    pension and OPEB plan assets. For details on the accounting of
    our pension and OPEB plans, see Note 7, Retirement
    Benefits. The implementation of SFAS No. 157 did not
    have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

SEC and FASB Guidance on Fair Value Measurements:

On
    September 30, 2008, in response to concerns about fair
    value accounting and its possible role in the recent declines in
    the financial markets, the SEC Office of the Chief Accountant
    and the FASB staff jointly released additional guidance on fair
    value measurements. The guidance, which was effective for us
    upon issuance, did not change or conflict with the fair value
    principles in SFAS No. 157, but rather provided
    further clarification on how to value a financial asset in an
    illiquid market. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active

. The standard is
    consistent with the joint guidance issued by the SEC and the
    FASB and was effective for us for the quarter ended
    September 30, 2008. The standard was to be applied
    prospectively. The guidance in this standard and the joint
    guidance provided by the FASB and the SEC did not affect our
    fair value measurements.

Cash Equivalents:

Our cash equivalents consist of
    money market funds with daily liquidity. The funds invest in
    U.S. Treasury notes, other government-backed securities,
    and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury
    notes.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Assets:

Our
    nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets are invested in
    various mutual funds. We value these assets using a market
    approach, which uses the daily quoted NAV provided by the fund
    managers that are the basis for transactions to buy or sell
    shares in each fund. On our Consolidated Balance Sheets, these
    assets are included in Other non-current assets.

SERP Assets:

Our SERP assets are valued using a
    market approach, which incorporates prices and other relevant
    information from market transactions. Our SERP equity securities
    consist of an investment in Standard & Poor’s 500
    Index mutual fund. The fund’s securities are listed on an
    active exchange or dealer market. The fair value of the SERP
    equity securities is based on the NAV of the mutual fund that is
    derived from the daily closing prices of the equity securities
    held by the fund. The NAV is the basis for transactions to buy
    or sell shares in the fund. Our SERP debt securities, which are
    investment grade municipal bonds, are valued using a market
    approach, which is based on a matrix pricing model that
    incorporates market-based information. The fair value of our
    SERP debt securities is derived from various observable inputs,
    including benchmark yields, reported securities trades,
    broker/dealer quotes, bond ratings, and general information on
    market movements for investment grade municipal securities
    normally considered by market participants when pricing a debt
    security. SERP assets are included in Other non-current assets
    on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional details about
    our SERP securities, see Note 6, Financial and Derivative
    Instruments.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
    Liabilities:

The non-qualified deferred compensation
    plan liabilities are valued based on the fair values of the plan
    assets, as they reflect what is owed to the plan participants in
    accordance with their investment elections. These liabilities,
    except for our primary DSSP plan liability, are included in
    Other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. Our primary DSSP plan liability is included in
    Non-current postretirement benefits on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

    through November 2009. These contracts are valued using an
    income approach that incorporated forward national fuel prices
    adjusted to reflect conditions in Michigan. The fair values of
    these contracts are included in Other current liabilities on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information on our
    fixed fuel price contracts, see Note 6, Financial and
    Derivative Instruments, “Derivative Instruments.”

At December 31, 2008, we did not have any assets or

We sold Palisades to Entergy for $380 million and as of
    December 31, 2007, received $363 million after various
    closing adjustments. We also paid Entergy $30 million to
    assume ownership and responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI.
    Because of the sale of Palisades, we paid the NMC, the former
    operator of Palisades, $7 million in exit fees and
    forfeited our $5 million investment in the NMC. Entergy
    assumed responsibility for the future decommissioning of
    Palisades and for storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel
    located at Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI sites.

We accounted for the disposal of Palisades as a financing for
    accounting purposes and thus we recognized no gain in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income. We accounted for the
    remaining non-real estate assets and liabilities associated with
    the transaction as a sale.

In November 2006, we sold all of our interests in the
    Consumers’ subsidiaries that held the MCV Partnership and
    the MCV Facility to an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners and
    Rockland Capital Energy Investments.

Because of the MCV PPA, the transaction is a sale and leaseback
    for accounting purposes. We have continuing involvement with the
    MCV Partnership through an existing guarantee associated with
    the future operations of the MCV Facility. As a result, we
    accounted for the MCV Facility as a financing for accounting
    purposes and not a sale. The value of the finance obligation was
    based on an allocation of the transaction proceeds to the fair
    values of the

CE-48


CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

net assets sold and fair value of the MCV Facility under the
    financing. The total proceeds were less than the fair value of
    the net assets sold. As a result, there were no proceeds
    remaining to allocate to the MCV Facility; therefore, we
    recorded no finance obligation.

The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of
    $41 million, which includes a reclassification of
    $30 million of AOCI into earnings, an $80 million
    impairment charge on the MCV Facility, an $8 million gain
    on the removal of our interests in the MCV Partnership and the
    MCV Facility, and $1 million benefit in general taxes. Upon
    the sale of our interests in the MCV Partnership and the FMLP,
    we were no longer the primary beneficiary of these entities and
    the entities were deconsolidated.

Impairment
    Charges

We recorded no impairments of long-lived assets for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. For the
    year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded an impairment
    charge of $218 million to recognize the reduction in fair
    value of the MCV Facility’s real estate assets. The result
    was an $80 million reduction to our consolidated net income
    after considering tax effects and minority interest.

4: CONTINGENCIES

Electric
    Contingencies

Electric Environmental Matters:

Our operations are
    subject to environmental laws and regulations. Generally, we
    have been able to recover in customer rates the costs to operate
    our facilities in compliance with these laws and regulations.

Cleanup and Solid Waste:

Under the NREPA, we will
    ultimately incur investigation and response activity costs at a
    number of sites. We believe that these costs will be recoverable
    in rates under current ratemaking policies.

We are a potentially responsible party at a number of
    contaminated sites administered under the Superfund. Superfund
    liability is joint and several. However, many other creditworthy
    parties with substantial assets are potentially responsible with
    respect to the individual sites. Based on our experience, we
    estimate that our share of the total liability for most of our
    known Superfund sites will be between $2 million and
    $11 million. A number of factors, including the number of
    potentially responsible parties involved with each site, affect
    our share of the total liability. As of December 31, 2008,
    we have recorded a liability of $2 million, the minimum
    amount of our range of possible outcomes estimated probable
    Superfund liability in accordance with FIN 14.

The timing of payments related to our investigation and response
    activities at our Superfund and NREPA sites is uncertain.
    Periodically, we receive information about new sites, which
    leads us to review our response activity estimates. Any
    significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an
    increase in the number of sites, different remediation
    techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and legal and
    regulatory requirements, could affect our estimates of NREPA and
    Superfund liability.

Ludington PCB:

In October 1998, during routine
    maintenance activities, we identified PCB as a component in
    certain paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington. We
    removed and replaced part of the PCB material with non-PCB
    material. Since proposing a plan to deal with the remaining
    materials, we have had several communications with the EPA. We
    are not able to predict when the EPA will issue a final ruling.
    We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Electric Utility Plant Air Permit Issues:

In April
    2007, we received a NOV/FOV from the EPA alleging that fourteen
    utility boilers exceeded visible emission limits in their
    associated air permits. The utility boilers are located at the
    Karn/Weadock Generating Complex, Campbell Plant, Cobb Electric
    Generating Station and Whiting Plant, which are all in Michigan.
    We have responded formally to the NOV/FOV denying the
    allegations and are awaiting the EPA’s response to our
    submission. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    this matter.

CE-49


CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Routine Maintenance Classification:

The EPA has
    alleged that some utilities have incorrectly classified major
    plant modifications as RMRR rather than seeking permits from the
    EPA to modify their plants. We responded to information requests
    from the EPA on this subject in 2000, 2002, and 2006. We believe
    that we have properly interpreted the requirements of RMRR. In
    October 2008, we received another information request from the
    EPA pursuant to Section 114 of the Clean Air Act. We
    responded to this information request in December 2008. In
    addition to the EPA’s information request, in October 2008,
    we received a NOV for three of our coal-based facilities
    relating to violations of NSR regulations, alleging ten projects
    from 1986 to 1998 were subject to NSR review. We met with the
    EPA in January 2009 and have additional meetings scheduled. If
    the EPA does not accept our interpretation of RMRR, we could be
    required to install additional pollution control equipment at
    some or all of our coal-based electric generating plants,
    surrender emission allowances, engage in supplemental
    environmental programs and pay fines. Additionally, we would
    need to assess the viability of continuing operations at certain
    plants. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    this matter.

Clean Air Interstate Rule:

In March 2005, the EPA
    adopted the CAIR, which required additional coal-based electric
    generating plant emission controls for nitrogen oxides and
    sulfur dioxide. The CAIR was appealed to the U.S. Court of
    Appeals for the District of Columbia. The court initially
    vacated the CAIR and the CAIR federal implementation plan in
    their entirety, but subsequently, the court changed course and
    remanded the rule to the EPA maintaining the rule in effect
    pending EPA revision. As a result, the CAIR still remains in
    effect, with the first annual nitrogen oxides compliance year
    beginning January 1, 2009. The EPA must now revise the rule
    to resolve the court’s concerns. The court did not set a
    timetable for the revision. We cannot predict the financial
    impact or outcome of this matter.

Litigation:

Our transmission charges paid to MISO
    have been subject to regulatory review and recovery through the
    annual PSCR process. The Attorney General has argued that the
    statute governing the PSCR process does not permit recovery of
    transmission charges in that manner and those expenses should be
    considered in general rate cases. Several decisions of the
    Michigan Court of Appeals have ruled against the Attorney
    General’s arguments, but in September 2008, the Michigan
    Supreme Court granted the Attorney General’s applications
    for leave to appeal two of those decisions. If the Michigan
    Supreme Court accepts the Attorney General’s position, we
    and other electric utilities will be required to obtain recovery
    of transmission charges through an alternative ratemaking
    mechanism. We expect a decision by the Michigan Supreme Court on
    these appeals by mid-2009. We cannot predict the financial
    impact or outcome of this matter.

Electric
    Rate Matters

Stranded Cost Recovery:

In November 2004, the MPSC
    approved recovery of our Stranded Costs incurred in 2002 and
    2003 plus interest through the period of collection through a
    surcharge on ROA customers. Since the MPSC order, we have
    experienced a downward trend in ROA customers, although recently
    this trend has slightly reversed. In October 2008, the Michigan
    legislature enacted legislation that amended the Customer Choice
    Act and directed the MPSC to approve rates that will allow
    recovery of Stranded Costs within five years. In January 2009,
    we filed an application with the MPSC requesting recovery of
    these Stranded Costs through a surcharge on both full service
    and ROA customers. At December 31, 2008, we had a
    regulatory asset for Stranded Costs of $71 million.

Power Supply Costs:

The PSCR process is designed to
    allow us to recover all of our power supply costs if incurred
    under reasonable and prudent policies and practices. The MPSC
    reviews these costs, policies, and practices for prudence in
    annual plan and reconciliation proceedings.

    2007 PSCR underrecoveries of $42 million. We
    self-implemented a 2008 PSCR charge in January 2008. In November
    2008, the MPSC issued an order approving our PSCR plan factor.

2009 PSCR Plan:

In September 2008, we submitted our
    2009 PSCR plan filing to the MPSC. The plan seeks approval to
    apply a uniform maximum PSCR factor of $0.02680 per kWh for all
    classes of customers. The plan also seeks approval to recover an
    expected $22 million discount in power supply charges
    provided to a large industrial customer. The MPSC approved the
    discount in 2005 to promote long-term investments in the
    industrial infrastructure of Michigan. We self-implemented a
    2009 PSCR charge in January 2009.

While we expect to recover fully all of our PSCR costs, we
    cannot predict the financial impact or the outcome of these
    proceedings. When we are unable to collect these costs as they
    are incurred, there is a negative impact on our cash flows.

Electric Rate Case:

In November 2008, we filed an
    application with the MPSC seeking an annual increase in revenue
    of $214 million based on an 11 percent authorized
    return on equity. The filing seeks recovery of costs associated
    with new plant investments including Clean Air Act investments,
    higher operating and maintenance costs, and the approval to
    recover costs associated with our advanced metering
    infrastructure program. The following table details the
    components of the requested increase in revenue:

This is the first electric rate case under the new streamlined
    regulatory process enacted by the Michigan legislation in
    October 2008. The new provisions generally allows utilities to
    self-implement rates six months after filing, subject to refund,
    unless the MPSC finds good cause to prohibit such
    self-implementation. The new provisions require the MPSC to
    issue an order 12 months after filing or the rates, as
    filed, become permanent. We cannot predict the financial impact
    or outcome of this proceeding.

Palisades Regulatory Proceedings:

The MPSC order
    approving the Palisades sale transaction required that we credit
    $255 million of excess sales proceeds and decommissioning
    amounts to our retail customers by December 2008. There are
    additional excess sales proceeds and decommissioning fund
    balances of $135 million above the amount in the MPSC
    order. The MPSC order in our 2007 electric rate case instructed
    us to offset the excess sales proceeds and decommissioning fund
    balances with $26 million of transaction costs from the
    Palisades sale and credit the remaining balance of
    $109 million to customers. The distribution of these funds
    is still pending with the MPSC.

Other
    Electric Contingencies

The MCV PPA:

We have a

35-year

power purchase agreement that began in 1990 with the MCV
    Partnership to purchase 1,240 MW of electricity. In June
    2008, the MPSC approved an amended and restated MCV PPA, which
    took effect in October 2008. The MCV PPA provides for:

•

a capacity charge of $10.14 per MWh of available capacity,

•

a fixed energy charge based on our annual average base load coal
    generating plant operating and maintenance cost,

•

a variable energy charge for all delivered energy that reflects
    the MCV Partnership’s cost of production,

•

a $5 million annual contribution by the MCV Partnership to
    a renewable resources program, and

•

an option for us to extend the MCV PPA for five years or
    purchase the MCV Facility at the conclusion of the MCV
    PPA’s term in March 2025.

Capacity and energy charges, net of RCP replacement energy and
    benefits, under the MCV PPA were $320 million in 2008,
    $464 million in 2007, and $411 million in 2006. We
    estimate that capacity and energy charges under the MCV PPA will
    range from $240 million to $330 million annually.

Nuclear Matters:

DOE Litigation:

In
    1997, a U.S. Court of Appeals decision confirmed that the
    DOE was to begin accepting deliveries of spent nuclear fuel for
    disposal by January 1998. Subsequent U.S. Court of Appeals
    litigation, in which we and other utilities participated, has
    not been successful in producing more specific relief for the
    DOE’s failure to accept the spent nuclear fuel.

A number of court decisions support the right of utilities to
    pursue damage claims in the United States Court of Claims
    against the DOE for failure to take delivery of spent nuclear
    fuel. We filed our complaint in December 2002. If our litigation
    against the DOE is successful, we plan to use any recoveries as
    reimbursement for the incurred costs of spent nuclear fuel
    storage during our ownership of Palisades and Big Rock. We
    cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.
    The sale of Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI did not transfer
    the right to any recoveries from the DOE related to costs of
    spent nuclear fuel storage incurred during our ownership of
    Palisades and Big Rock.

Big Rock Decommissioning:

The MPSC and the FERC
    regulate the recovery of costs to decommission Big Rock. In
    December 2000, funding of a Big Rock trust fund ended because
    the MPSC-authorized decommissioning surcharge collection period
    expired. The level of funds provided by the trust fell short of
    the amount needed to complete decommissioning. As a result, we
    provided $44 million of corporate contributions for
    decommissioning costs. This amount is in addition to the
    $30 million payment to Entergy to assume ownership and
    responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI and additional corporate
    contributions for nuclear fuel storage costs of
    $55 million, due to the DOE’s failure to accept spent
    nuclear fuel on schedule. At December 31, 2008, we have a
    $129 million regulatory asset recorded on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets for these costs.

In July 2008, we filed an application with the MPSC seeking the
    deferral of ratemaking treatment for the recovery of our nuclear
    fuel storage costs and the payment to Entergy, until the
    litigation regarding these costs is

CE-52


CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

resolved in the federal courts. In the application, we also are
    seeking to recover the $44 million Big Rock decommissioning
    shortfall from customers. We cannot predict the outcome of this
    proceeding.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Cost:

We deferred payment for
    disposal of spent nuclear fuel used before April 7, 1983.
    Our DOE liability is $162 million at December 31,
    2008. This amount includes interest, and is payable upon the
    first delivery of spent nuclear fuel to the DOE. We recovered
    the amount of this liability, excluding a portion of interest,
    through electric rates. In conjunction with the sale of
    Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI, we retained this obligation
    and provide a $162 million letter of credit to Entergy as
    security for this obligation.

Gas
    Contingencies

Gas Environmental Matters:

We expect to incur
    investigation and remediation costs at a number of sites under
    the NREPA, a Michigan statute that covers environmental
    activities including remediation. These sites include 23 former
    manufactured gas plant facilities. We operated the facilities on
    these sites for some part of their operating lives. For some of
    these sites, we have no current ownership or may own only a
    portion of the original site. In December 2008, we estimated our
    remaining costs to be between $38 million and
    $52 million. We expect to fund most of these costs through
    proceeds from insurance settlements and MPSC-approved rates.

At December 31, 2008, we have a liability of
    $38 million and a regulatory asset of $69 million
    that, includes $31 million of deferred MGP expenditures.
    The timing of payments related to the remediation of our
    manufactured gas plant sites is uncertain. We expect annual
    response activity costs to range between $5 million and
    $6 million over the next five years. Periodically, we
    review these response activity cost estimates. Any significant
    change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the
    number of sites, changes in remediation techniques or legal and
    regulatory requirements, could affect our estimates of annual
    response activity costs and MGP liability.

FERC Investigation:

In February 2008, we received a
    data request relating to an investigation the FERC is conducting
    into possible violations of the FERC’s posting and
    competitive bidding regulations related to releases of firm
    capacity on natural gas pipelines. We responded to the
    FERC’s first data request in the first quarter of 2008. In
    July 2008, we responded to a second set of data requests from
    the FERC. The FERC has also taken depositions and made an
    additional data request. We cannot predict the financial impact
    or the outcome of this matter.

Gas
    Rate Matters

Gas Cost Recovery:

The GCR process is designed to
    allow us to recover all of our purchased natural gas costs if
    incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.
    The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices for
    prudence in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings.

The following table summarizes our GCR reconciliation filings
    currently pending with the MPSC:

The total amount reflects an overrecovery of $15 million plus $2
    million in accrued interest owed to customers.

GCR plan for year

2008-2009:

In
    February 2009, the MPSC issued an order for our

2008-2009

GCR plan year. The order approved a base GCR ceiling factor of
    $8.17 per mcf for April 2008 through March 2009, subject to a
    quarterly ceiling price adjustment mechanism.

Due to an increase in NYMEX gas prices, the base GCR ceiling
    factor increased to $9.52 per mcf for the three-month period of
    April through June 2008 and to $9.92 for the three-month period
    of July through September 2008,

CE-53


CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

pursuant to the quarterly ceiling price adjustment mechanism.
    Beginning in October 2008, the base GCR ceiling factor was
    adjusted to $8.17 due to a decrease in NYMEX gas prices.

The GCR billing factor is adjusted monthly in order to minimize
    the over or underrecovery amounts in our annual GCR
    reconciliation. Our GCR billing factor for March 2009 is $8.17
    per mcf. We are currently anticipating an underrecovery will
    occur during the

2008-2009

GCR year.

GCR plan for year

2009-2010:

In
    December 2008, we filed an application with the MPSC seeking
    approval of a GCR plan for our

2009-2010

GCR plan year. Our request proposed the use of a base GCR
    ceiling factor of $8.10 per mcf, plus a quarterly GCR ceiling
    price adjustment contingent upon future events. We expect to
    self-implement a 2009 GCR charge in April 2009.

While we expect to recover fully all of our GCR costs, we cannot
    predict the financial impact or the outcome of these
    proceedings. When we are unable to collect GCR costs as they are
    incurred, there is a negative impact on our cash flows.

Gas Depreciation:

On August 1, 2008, we filed a
    gas depreciation case using 2007 data with the MPSC-ordered
    variations on traditional cost-of-removal methodologies. In
    December 2008, the MPSC approved a partial settlement agreement
    allowing us to implement the filed depreciation rates, on an
    interim basis, concurrent with the implementation of settled
    rates in our 2008 gas rate case. The interim depreciation rates
    reduce our depreciation expense by approximately
    $20 million per year and will remain in effect until a
    final order is issued in our gas depreciation case. If a final
    order in our gas depreciation case is not issued concurrently
    with a final order in a general gas rate case, the MPSC may
    incorporate the results of the depreciation case into general
    gas rates through a surcharge, which may be either positive or
    negative.

2008 Gas Rate Case:

In December 2008, the MPSC approved a
    settlement agreement authorizing a rate increase of
    $22 million, based on a 10.55 percent authorized
    return on equity, for service rendered on and after
    December 24, 2008. The settlement includes a
    $20 million decrease in depreciation rates and requires
    that we not request a new gas general rate increase prior to
    May 1, 2009.

Other
    Contingencies — Indemnifications

Guarantees and Indemnifications:

FIN 45
    requires a guarantor, upon issuance of a guarantee, to recognize
    a liability for the fair value of the obligation it undertakes
    in issuing the guarantee. To measure the fair value of a
    guarantee liability, we recognize a liability for any premium
    received or receivable in exchange for the guarantee. For a
    guarantee issued as part of a larger transaction, such as in
    association with an asset sale or executory contract, we
    recognize a liability for any premium that we would have
    received had we issued the guarantee as a single item.

In the normal course of business, we issue surety bonds and

    transactions. We would be required to pay a counterparty if it
    incurs losses due to a breach of contract terms or
    nonperformance under the contract. At December 31, 2008,
    the guarantee liability recorded for surety bonds and
    indemnities was immaterial. The maximum obligation for surety
    bonds and indemnities was less than $1 million.

(b)

The maximum obligation includes $85 million related to the
    MCV Partnership’s non-performance under a steam and
    electric power agreement with Dow. We sold our interests in the
    MCV Partnership and the FMLP.

CE-54


CONSUMERS ENERGY

NOTES TO

The sales agreement calls for the purchaser, an affiliate of GSO
    Capital Partners and Rockland Capital Energy Investments, to pay
    $85 million, subject to certain reimbursement rights, if
    Dow terminates an agreement under which the MCV Partnership
    provides it steam and electric power. This agreement expires in
    March 2016, subject to certain terms and conditions. The
    purchaser secured its reimbursement obligation with an
    irrevocable letter of credit of up to $85 million.

We also enter into various agreements containing tax and other
    indemnification provisions for which, due to a number of
    factors, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential
    obligation. These factors include unspecified exposure under
    certain agreements. We consider the likelihood that we would be
    required to perform or incur significant losses related to these
    indemnities to be remote.

Other:

In addition to the matters disclosed within
    this Note, we are party to certain lawsuits and administrative
    proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies
    arising from the ordinary course of business. These lawsuits and

In March 2008, we utilized the Michigan Strategic Fund for the
    issuance of $28 million of tax-exempt Michigan Strategic
    Fund Limited Obligation Refunding Revenue Bonds, bearing
    interest at a 4.25 percent annual rate. The bonds are
    secured by FMB. We used the proceeds to redeem $28 million
    of insured tax-exempt bonds in April 2008.

(b)

In March 2008, we utilized the Michigan Strategic Fund for the
    issuance of $68 million of tax-exempt Michigan Strategic
    Fund Variable Rate Limited Obligation Refunding Revenue
    Bonds. The initial interest rate was 2.25 percent and it
    resets weekly. The bonds, which are backed by a letter of
    credit, are subject to optional tender by the holders that would
    result in remarketing. We used the proceeds to redeem
    $68 million of insured tax-exempt bonds in April 2008.

In April 2008, we caused the conversion of $35 million of
    tax-exempt Michigan Strategic Fund Variable Rate Limited
    Obligation Revenue Bonds from insured bonds to demand bonds,
    backed by a letter of credit.

The Michigan Strategic Fund is housed within the Michigan
    Department of Treasury to provide public and private development
    finance opportunities for agriculture, forestry, business,
    industry and communities within the State of Michigan.

First Mortgage Bonds:

We secure our FMB by a
    mortgage and lien on substantially all of our property. Our
    ability to issue FMB is restricted by certain provisions in the
    First Mortgage Bond Indenture and the need for regulatory
    approvals under federal law. Restrictive issuance provisions in
    our First Mortgage Bond Indenture include achieving a two-times
    interest coverage ratio and having sufficient unfunded net
    property additions.

Regulatory Authorization for Financings:

The FERC
    has authorized us to have outstanding at any one time, up to
    $1.0 billion of secured and unsecured short-term securities
    for general corporate purposes. The remaining availability is
    $550 million at December 31, 2008.

The FERC has also authorized us to issue and sell up to
    $1.5 billion of secured and unsecured long-term securities
    for general corporate purposes. The remaining availability is
    $950 million at December 31, 2008.

The authorizations are for the period ending June 30, 2010.
    Any long-term issuances during the authorization period are
    exempt from the FERC’s competitive bidding and negotiated
    placement requirements.

Dividend Restrictions:

Under the provisions of our
    articles of incorporation, at December 31, 2008, we had
    $331 million of unrestricted retained earnings available to
    pay common stock dividends. Provisions of the Federal Power Act
    and the Natural Gas Act effectively restrict dividends to the
    amount of our retained earnings. Several decisions from the FERC
    suggest that under a variety of circumstances our common stock
    dividends would not be limited to amounts in our retained
    earnings. Decisions in those circumstances would, however, be
    based on specific facts and circumstances and would result only
    after a formal regulatory filing process.

During 2008, we paid $297 million in common stock dividends
    to CMS Energy.

Sale of Accounts Receivable:

Under a revolving
    accounts receivable sales program, we sell eligible accounts
    receivable to a wholly owned, consolidated, bankruptcy-remote
    special-purpose entity. In turn, the special purpose entity may
    sell an undivided interest in up to $250 million of the
    receivables at December 31, 2008, reduced from
    $325 million at December 31, 2007. The special purpose
    entity sold $170 million in receivables at
    December 31, 2008 and no receivables at December 31,
    2007. The purchaser of the receivables has no recourse against
    our other assets for failure of a debtor to pay when due and no
    right to any receivables not sold. We have neither recorded a
    gain or loss on the receivables sold nor retained any interest
    in the receivables sold. We continue to service the receivables
    sold to the special-purpose entity.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we held 1.8 million
    shares of CMS Energy Common Stock.

SERP equity securities consist of an investment in a
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Index mutual fund. SERP
    debt securities consist of investment grade municipal bonds.

During 2008, the fair value of our SERP investment in equity
    securities declined to $25 million. We determined that this
    decline in fair value was other than temporary. Accordingly, we
    reclassified net unrealized losses of $16 million
    ($10 million, net of tax) from AOCL to Other expense in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income and established a new cost
    basis of $25 million for these investments, which was equal
    to fair value at December 31, 2008.

During 2008, the proceeds from sales of SERP securities were
    $2 million. Gross losses realized were immaterial. During
    2007, the proceeds from sales of SERP securities were
    $29 million, and $11 million of gross gains and
    $1 million of gross losses were realized. We reclassified
    net gains of $7 million, net of tax of $3 million,
    from AOCL and included this amount in net income in 2007. The
    proceeds from sales of SERP securities were $3 million
    during 2006. Gross gains and losses were immaterial in 2006.

Derivative Instruments:

In order to limit our
    exposure to certain market risks, primarily changes in interest
    rates, commodity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates, we
    may enter into various risk management contracts, such as swaps,
    options, and forward contracts. We enter into these contracts
    using established policies and procedures, under the direction
    of an executive oversight committee consisting of senior
    management representatives and a risk committee consisting of
    business unit managers.

The contracts we use to manage market risks may qualify as
    derivative instruments that are subject to derivative accounting
    under SFAS No. 133. If a contract is a derivative and
    does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception
    under SFAS No. 133, we record it on our consolidated
    balance sheet at its fair value. Each quarter, we adjust the
    resulting asset or liability to reflect any change in the fair
    value of the contract, a practice known as marking the contract
    to market. Since we have not designated any of our derivatives
    as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133, we report all
    mark-to-market gains and losses in earnings. For a discussion of
    how we determine the fair value of our derivatives, see
    Note 2, Fair Value Measurements.

Most of our commodity purchase and sale contracts are not
    subject to derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133
    because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units
    specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity
    or bcf of natural gas),

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales
    exception, or

•

there is not an active market for the commodity.

Our coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is
    not an active market for the coal we purchase. If an active
    market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts
    may qualify as derivatives. Under regulatory accounting, the
    resulting mark-to-market gains and losses would be offset by
    changes in regulatory assets and liabilities and would not
    affect net income.

Fixed price fuel contracts:

In December 2008, we
    entered into two financial contracts to fix economically the
    price of gasoline and diesel fuel we purchase for our fleet
    vehicles and equipment. Under these agreements, we have
    effectively locked in a price per gallon for gasoline and diesel
    fuel we will purchase from January through November 2009. At
    December 31, 2008, the fair value of these derivatives was
    a liability of $1 million. We record the fair value of
    these derivatives in Other current liabilities on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recorded the mark-to-market
    losses on these derivatives in Other expense on our Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

7: RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

We provide retirement benefits to our employees under a number
    of different plans, including:

•

a non-contributory, qualified defined benefit Pension Plan
    (closed to new non-union participants as of July 1, 2003
    and closed to new union participants as of September 1,
    2005),

•

a qualified cash balance Pension Plan for certain employees
    hired between July 1, 2003 and August 31, 2005,

•

a non-contributory, qualified DCCP for employees hired on or
    after September 1, 2005,

•

benefits to certain management employees under a
    non-contributory, nonqualified defined benefit SERP (closed to
    new participants as of March 31, 2006),

•

benefits to certain management employees under a
    non-contributory, nonqualified DC SERP hired on or after
    April 1, 2006,

•

health care and life insurance benefits under OPEB,

•

benefits to a selected group of management under a
    non-contributory, nonqualified EISP, and

•

a contributory, qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan.

Pension Plan:

The Pension Plan includes funds for
    most of our current employees, the employees of our
    subsidiaries, and Panhandle, a former subsidiary. The Pension
    Plan’s assets are not distinguishable by company.

On September 1, 2005, we implemented the DCCP. The DCCP
    provides an employer contribution of five percent of base pay to
    the existing employees’ 401(k) plan. No employee
    contribution is required in order to receive the plan’s
    employer contribution. All employees hired on and after
    September 1, 2005 participate in this plan. Participants in
    the cash balance pension plan, in effect from July 1, 2003
    to September 1, 2005, also participate in the DCCP as of
    September 1, 2005. Additional pay credits under the cash
    balance pension plan were discontinued as of that date. The DCCP
    expense was $3 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008 and $2 million for the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006.

SERP:

SERP benefits are paid from a trust
    established in 1988. SERP is not a qualified plan under the
    Internal Revenue Code. SERP trust earnings are taxable and trust
    assets are included in our consolidated assets. Consumers’
    trust assets were $45 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $53 million at December 31, 2007. The assets are
    classified as Other non-current assets on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The ABO for SERP was $47 million at
    December 31, 2008 and $48 million at December 31,
    2007. A contribution of $21 million was made to the trust
    in December 2007.

On April 1, 2006, we implemented a DC SERP and froze
    further new participation in the defined benefit SERP. The DC
    SERP provides participants benefits ranging from 5 percent
    to 15 percent of total compensation. The DC SERP requires a
    minimum of five years of participation before vesting. Our
    contributions to the plan, if any, will be placed in a grantor
    trust. Trust assets were less than $1 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. The assets are classified as
    Other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
    DC SERP expense was less than $1 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

401(k):

The employer’s match for the 401(k)
    plan is 60 percent on eligible contributions up to the
    first six percent of an employee’s wages. The total 401(k)
    plan cost was $15 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 and $14 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006.

EISP:

We implemented a nonqualified EISP in 2002 to
    provide flexibility in separation of employment by officers, a
    selected group of management, or other highly compensated
    employees. Terms of the plan may include payment of a lump sum,
    payment of monthly benefits for life, payment of premiums for
    continuation of health care, or any other legally permissible
    term deemed to be in our best interest to offer. The EISP
    expense was less than

$1 million for each of the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006. The ABO for the EISP was $1 million at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007.

OPEB:

The OPEB plan covers all regular full-time
    employees who are covered by the employee health care plan on a
    company-subsidized basis the day before they retire from the
    company at age 55 or older and who have at least 10 full
    years of applicable continuous service. Regular full-time
    employees who qualify for a pension plan disability retirement
    and have 15 years of applicable continuous service are also
    eligible. Retiree health care costs were based on the assumption
    that costs would increase 8.0 percent for those under 65
    and 9.5 percent for those over 65 in 2008. The 2009 rate of
    increase for OPEB health costs for those under 65 is expected to
    be 8.5 percent and for those over 65 is expected to be
    8.0 percent. The rate of increase is expected to slow to
    5 percent for those under 65 by 2017 and for those over 65
    by 2017 and thereafter.

The health care cost trend rate assumption affects the estimated
    costs recorded. A one percentage point change in the assumed
    health care cost trend assumption would have the following

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 106 in 1992, we recorded a
    liability of $466 million for the accumulated transition
    obligation and a corresponding regulatory asset for anticipated
    recovery in utility rates. For additional details, see
    Note 1, Corporate Structure and Accounting Policies,
    “Utility Regulation.” The MPSC authorized recovery of
    the electric utility portion of these costs in 1994 over
    18 years and the gas utility portion in 1996 over
    16 years.

SFAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R):

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 158. This standard required us to recognize
    the funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006.
    SFAS No. 158 also required us to recognize changes in
    the funded status of our plans in the year in which the changes
    occur. In addition, the standard required that we change our
    plan measurement date from November 30 to December 31,
    effective December 31, 2008. In the first quarter of 2008,
    we recorded the measurement date change, which resulted in a
    $6 million net-of-tax decrease to retained earnings, a
    $4 million reduction to the SFAS No. 158
    regulatory assets, a $7 million increase in Postretirement
    benefit liabilities, and a $5 million increase in Deferred
    tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In April 2008, the MPSC issued an order in our PSCR case that
    allowed us to collect a one-time surcharge under a pension and
    OPEB equalization mechanism. For 2008, we collected
    $10 million of pension and $2 million of OPEB
    surcharge revenue in electric rates. We recorded a reduction of
    $12 million of equalization regulatory assets on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets and an increase of $12 million
    of expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Thus, our
    collection of the equalization mechanism surcharge had no impact
    on net income for the year ended December 31, 2008.

(a)

Regulatory adjustments are the differences between amounts
    included in rates and the periodic benefit cost calculated
    pursuant to SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106.
    The pension regulatory asset had a balance of $29 million
    at December 31, 2008 and $33 million at
    December 31, 2007. The OPEB regulatory asset had a balance
    of $5 million at December 31, 2008 and $8 million
    at December 31, 2007.

The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined
    benefit pension plans that will be amortized into net periodic
    benefit cost over the next fiscal year from the regulatory asset
    is $44 million. The estimated net loss and prior service
    credit for OPEB plans that will be amortized into net periodic
    benefit cost over the next fiscal year from the regulatory asset
    is $23 million.

We amortize gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the
    greater of the benefit obligation and the MRV over the average
    remaining service period. The estimated time of amortization of
    gains and losses is 12 years for pension and 14 years
    for OPEB. Prior service cost amortization is established in the
    years in which the prior service cost first occurred, and are
    based on the same amortization period in all future years until
    the prior service costs are fully

We contributed $50 million to our OPEB plan in 2008 and we
    plan to contribute $52 million to our OPEB plan in 2009. Of
    the $50 million OPEB contribution made during 2008,
    $10 million was contributed to the 401(h) component of the
    qualified pension plan and the remaining $40 million was
    contributed to the VEBA trust accounts. We did not contribute to
    our Pension Plan in 2008, but plan to contribute
    $291 million to our Pension Plan in 2009. Contributions
    include required and discretionary amounts. Actual future
    contributions will depend on future investment performance,
    changes in future discount rates, and various other factors
    related to the populations participating in the plans.

In 2008, the consultant for the Pension Plan, recommended an
    adjustment to the target asset allocation for Pension Plan
    assets. The recommended revised target asset allocation for the
    Pension Plan assets was 50 percent equity, 30 percent
    fixed income, and 20 percent alternative strategy
    investments from the previous target of 60 percent equity,
    30 percent fixed income and 10 percent alternative
    strategy investments. This recommendation was thoroughly
    reviewed and approved by our Benefit Administration Committee.
    This adjustment is being made gradually by the allocation of
    contributions into alternative assets and the drawdown of
    equities to cover plan benefit payments and distributions. This
    revised target asset allocation is expected to continue to
    maximize the

CE-66


CONSUMERS ENERGY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent
    level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the
    liabilities of the plan. Equity investments are diversified
    mostly across the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
    with lesser allocations to the Standard & Poor’s
    MidCap and SmallCap Indexes and Foreign Equity Funds.
    Fixed-income investments are diversified across investment grade
    instruments of both government and corporate issuers as well as
    high-yield and global bond funds. Alternative strategies are
    diversified across absolute return investment approaches and
    global tactical asset allocation. We use annual liability
    measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic
    asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to
    the portfolio allocation.

We established union and non-union VEBA trusts to fund our
    future retiree health and life insurance benefits. These trusts
    are funded through the ratemaking process for Consumers and
    through direct contributions from the non-utility subsidiaries.
    We invest the equity portions of the union and non-union health
    care VEBA trusts in a Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
    fund. We invest the fixed-income portion of the union health
    care VEBA trust in domestic investment grade taxable
    instruments. We invest the fixed-income portion of the non-union
    health care VEBA trust in a diversified mix of domestic
    tax-exempt securities. The investment selections of each VEBA
    trust are influenced by the tax consequences, as well as the
    objective of generating asset returns that will meet the medical
    and life insurance costs of retirees.

8: ASSET
    RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations

:

This standard requires us to record
    the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their
    useful lives, if there is a legal obligation to remove them. No
    market risk premium was included in our ARO fair value estimate
    since a reasonable estimate could not be made. If a five percent
    market risk premium were assumed, our ARO liability at
    December 31, 2008 would increase by $10 million.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the
    period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with
    indeterminate lives, the liability is to be recognized when a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Historically, our
    gas transmission and electric and gas distribution assets have
    indeterminate lives and retirement cash flows that cannot be
    determined. During 2007, however, we implemented a new fixed
    asset accounting system that facilitates ARO accounting
    estimates for gas distribution mains and services. The new
    system enabled us to calculate a reasonable estimate of the fair
    value of the cost to cut, purge, and cap abandoned gas
    distribution mains and services at the end of their useful
    lives. We recorded a $101 million ARO liability and an
    asset of equal value at December 31, 2007. We have not
    recorded a liability for assets that have insignificant
    cumulative disposal costs, such as substation batteries.

FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations:

This
    Interpretation clarified the term “conditional asset
    retirement obligation” used in SFAS No. 143. The
    term refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement
    activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are
    conditional on a future event. We determined that abatement of
    asbestos included in our plant investments and the cut, purge,
    and cap of abandoned gas distribution mains and services qualify
    as conditional AROs, as defined by FIN 47.

    obligations to remove at the end of their useful lives and for
    which we have an ARO liability recorded:

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

April 2007, we sold Palisades to Entergy and paid Entergy to
    assume ownership and responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI. Our
    AROs related to Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI ended with the
    sale, and we removed the related ARO liabilities from our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also removed the Big Rock ARO
    related to the plant in the second quarter of 2007 due to the
    completion of decommissioning.

9: INCOME
    TAXES

We join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax
    return and a combined Michigan income tax return with CMS Energy
    and its subsidiaries. Income taxes generally are allocated based
    on each company’s separate taxable income in accordance
    with the CMS Energy tax sharing agreement. We had tax related
    payables to CMS Energy of $75 million in 2008 and
    $154 million in 2007.

We utilize deferred tax accounting for temporary differences.
    These occur when there are differences between the book and tax
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. ITC has been
    deferred and is being amortized over the estimated service life
    of related properties. We use ITC to reduce current income taxes
    payable.

At December 31, 2008, we had federal tax loss carryforwards
    of $77 million that expire from 2023 through 2028. In
    addition, we have a net benefit of $194 million for future
    Michigan tax deductions which were granted as part of the
    Michigan Business Tax legislation of 2007. We do not believe
    that valuation allowances are required, as we expect to fully
    utilize the loss carryforwards prior to their expiration.

Current tax expense reflects the settlement of income tax audits

    are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary
    differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and
    the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or
    non-current according to the classification of the related
    assets or liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not
    related to assets or liabilities are classified according to the
    expected reversal date of the temporary differences.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits
    by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which can result
    in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome
    for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe
    that our accrued tax liabilities at December 31, 2008 are
    adequate for all years.

In June 2006, the IRS concluded its most recent audit of CMS
    Energy and its subsidiaries, and adjusted taxable income for the
    years ended December 31, 1987 through December 31,
    2001. The overall cumulative increase to taxable income related
    primarily to the disallowance of the simplified service cost
    method with respect to certain self-constructed utility assets,
    resulting in a deferral of these expenses to future periods. The
    adjustments to taxable income have been allocated based upon
    Consumers’ separate taxable income in accordance with CMS
    Energy’s tax sharing agreement. We made a payment to CMS
    Energy for our share of these audit adjustments of
    $232 million, and reduced our 2006 income tax provision by
    $19 million, primarily for the restoration and utilization
    of previously written off income tax credits. The years 2002
    through 2007 are open under the statute of limitations and 2002
    through 2005 are currently under audit by the IRS.

On January 1, 2007 we adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48,
    we recorded a charge for additional uncertain tax benefits of
    $5 million, accounted for as a reduction of our beginning
    retained earnings. Included in this amount was an increase in
    our valuation allowance of $7 million, increases to tax
    reserves of $55 million and a decrease to deferred tax
    liabilities of $57 million. The capital gains of 2007
    provided for the release of $23 million of valuation
    allowance, as reflected in our effective tax rate reconciliation.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48 is as
    follows:

The balance of $55 million is entirely attributable to tax
    positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain
    but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such
    deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
    the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not
    affect the annual effective tax rate. Since all our remaining
    uncertain tax benefits relate only to timing issues, at
    December 31, 2008, there are no uncertain benefits that
    would reduce our effective tax rate in future years. It is
    reasonably possible that, within the next twelve months, we will
    settle with the IRS on our simplified service cost methodology,
    a timing issue. An estimate of a settlement range cannot be made
    at this point.

We accrued an additional $1 million of net interest on tax
    liabilities during 2008. The total net interest liability is
    $3 million as of December 31, 2008, none of which is
    related to uncertain tax positions. We recognize accrued
    interest and penalties, where applicable, related to uncertain
    tax benefits as part of income tax expense.

10: STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

We provide a Performance Incentive Stock Plan (the Plan) to key
    employees and non-employee directors based on their
    contributions to the successful management of the company. The
    Plan has a five-year term, expiring in May 2009.

CONSUMERS ENERGY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

All grants under the Plan for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were in the
    form of TSR restricted stock and time-lapse restricted stock.
    Restricted stock recipients receive shares of CMS Energy Common
    Stock that have full dividend and voting rights. TSR restricted
    stock vesting is contingent on meeting a three-year service
    requirement and specific market conditions. Half of the market
    condition is based on the achievement of specified levels of TSR
    over a three-year period and half is based on a comparison of
    our TSR with the median shareholders’ return of a peer
    group over the same three-year period. Depending on the
    performance of the market, a recipient may earn a total award
    ranging from zero to 150 percent of the initial grant.
    Time-lapse restricted stock vests after a service period of five
    years for awards granted prior to 2004, and three years for
    awards granted in 2004 and thereafter. Restricted stock awards
    granted to officers in 2006 were entirely TSR restricted stock.
    Awards granted to officers in 2007 and 2008 were
    80 percent TSR restricted stock and 20 percent
    time-lapsed restricted stock.

All restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if
    employment terminates before vesting. However, if certain
    minimum service requirements are met or are waived by action of
    the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of
    Directors, restricted shares may vest fully upon:

•

retirement,

•

disability, or

•

change of control of CMS Energy, as defined by the Plan.

The Plan also allows for stock options, stock appreciation
    rights, phantom shares, and performance units, none of which
    were granted in 2008, 2007, or 2006.

Shares awarded or subject to stock options, phantom shares, and
    performance units may not exceed 6 million shares from June
    2004 through May 2009, nor may such awards to any recipient
    exceed 250,000 shares in any fiscal year. We may issue
    awards of up to 3,384,080 shares of common stock under the
    Plan at December 31, 2008. Shares for which payment or
    exercise is in cash, as well as forfeited shares or stock
    options, may be awarded or granted again under the Plan.

(b)

During 2008, 338,725 TSR shares granted in 2005 were forfeited
    due to the failure to meet the specific market conditions.

We expense the awards’ fair value over the required service
    period. As a result, we recognize all compensation expense for
    share-based awards that have accelerated service provisions upon
    retirement by the period in which the employee becomes eligible
    to retire. We calculate the fair value of time-lapse restricted
    stock based on the price of our common stock on the grant date.
    We calculate the fair value of TSR restricted stock awards on
    the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. We base expected
    volatilities on the historical volatility of the price of CMS
    Energy Common Stock.

Stock options give the holder the right to purchase common stock

    exercisable upon grant, and expire up to ten years and one month
    from the grant date. We issue new shares when recipients
    exercise stock options. The total intrinsic value of stock
    options exercised was less than $1 million in 2008,
    $6 million in 2007, and $1 million in 2006. Cash
    received from exercise of these stock options was less than

    the modified prospective method recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R) instead of retrospective restatement.
    We adopted the fair value method of accounting for share-based
    awards effective December 2002. Therefore,
    SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a significant impact on
    our results of operations when it became effective.

11: LEASES

We lease various assets, including service vehicles, railcars,
    gas pipeline capacity and buildings. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 13, we account for a number of our power
    purchase agreements as capital and operating leases.

Operating leases for coal-carrying railcars have lease terms
    expiring over the next 15 years. These leases contain fair
    market value extension and buyout provisions, with some
    providing for predetermined extension period rentals. Capital
    leases for our vehicle fleet operations have a maximum term of
    120 months and TRAC end-of-life provisions.

We have capital leases for gas transportation pipelines to the
    Karn generating complex and Zeeland power plant. The capital
    lease for the gas transportation pipeline into the Karn
    generating complex has a term of 15 years with a provision
    to extend the contract from month to month. The capital lease
    for the gas transportation pipeline to the Zeeland power plant
    has a lease term of 12 years with a renewal provision at
    the end of the contract. The remaining term of our long-term
    power purchase agreements range between 2 and 22 years.
    Most of our power purchase agreements contain provisions at the
    end of the initial contract term to renew the agreement annually.

We are authorized by the MPSC to record both capital and
    operating lease payments as operating expense and recover the
    total cost from our customers. The following table summarizes

In April 2007, we sold Palisades to Entergy and entered into a

15-year

power purchase agreement to buy all of the capacity and energy
    produced by Palisades, up to the annual average capacity of
    798 MW. We provided $30 million in security to Entergy
    for our power purchase agreement obligation in the form of a
    letter of credit. We estimate that capacity and energy payments
    under the Palisades power purchase agreement will average
    $320 million annually. Our total purchases of capacity and
    energy under the Palisades power purchase agreement were
    $298 million in 2008 and $180 million in 2007.

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Because of the Palisades power purchase agreement and our
    continuing involvement with the Palisades assets, we accounted
    for the disposal of Palisades as a financing and not a sale.
    SFAS No. 98 specifies the accounting required for a
    seller’s sale and simultaneous leaseback involving real
    estate. We have continuing involvement with Palisades through
    security provided to Entergy for our power purchase agreement
    obligation, our DOE liability and other forms of involvement. As
    a result, we accounted for the Palisades plant, which is the
    real estate asset subject to the leaseback, as a financing for
    accounting purposes and not a sale. As a financing, no gain on
    the sale of Palisades was recognized in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. We accounted for the remaining non-real
    estate assets and liabilities associated with the transaction as
    a sale.

As a financing, the Palisades plant remains on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets and we continue to depreciate it. We recorded the
    related proceeds as a finance obligation with payments recorded
    to interest expense and the finance obligation based on the
    amortization of the obligation over the life of the Palisades
    power purchase agreement. The value of the finance obligation
    was based on an allocation of the transaction proceeds to the
    fair values of the net assets sold and fair value of the
    Palisades plant asset under the financing. Total amortization
    and interest charges under the financing were $23 million
    in 2008 and $18 million in 2007.

Asset Acquisition:

In December 2007, we purchased a
    935 MW gas-based generating plant located in Zeeland,
    Michigan for $519 million from an affiliate of LS Power
    Group. The original cost of the plant was $350 million and
    the plant acquisition adjustment was $213 million. This
    results in an increase to property, plant, and equipment of
    $519 million, net of $44 million of accumulated
    depreciation. The purchase also increased capital leases by
    $12 million. For additional details on the Zeeland finance
    lease, see Note 11, Leases.

(a)

Net investment is the amount of utility plant in service less
    accumulated depreciation.

We include our share of the direct expenses of the jointly owned
    plants in operating expenses. We share operation, maintenance,
    and other expenses of these jointly owned utility facilities in
    proportion to each participant’s undivided ownership
    interest. We are required to provide only our share of financing
    for the jointly owned utility facilities.

14: REPORTABLE
    SEGMENTS

Our reportable segments consist of business units defined by the
    products and services they offer. We evaluate performance based
    on the net income of each segment. Our two reportable segments
    are electric utility and gas utility.

The electric utility segment consists of regulated activities
    associated with the generation and distribution of electricity
    in Michigan. The gas utility segment consists of regulated
    activities associated with the transportation, storage, and
    distribution of natural gas in Michigan.

Accounting policies of our segments are as described in
    Note 1, Corporate Structure and Accounting Policies. Our
    consolidated financial statements reflect the assets,
    liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the two individual
    segments when appropriate. We allocate accounts between the
    electric and gas segments where common accounts are attributable
    to both segments. The allocations are based on certain measures
    of business activities, such as revenue, labor dollars,
    customers, construction expense, leased property, taxes or
    functional surveys. For example, customer receivables are
    allocated based on revenue, and pension provisions are allocated
    based on labor dollars.

We account for inter-segment sales and transfers at current
    market prices and eliminate them in consolidated net income
    available to common stockholder by segment. The
    “Other” segment includes our consolidated special
    purpose entity for the sale of trade receivables, and in 2006
    the MCV Partnership and the FMLP.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of Consumers Energy
    Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of income (loss), of cash
    flows, and of common stockholder’s equity present fairly,
    in all material respects, the financial position of Consumers
    Energy Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008
    and December 31, 2007, and the results of their operations
    and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period
    ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules
    listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein when read in
    conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
    Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements and financial statement
    schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial
    statement schedules, and on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We
    conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain income tax provisions in 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholder of Consumers Energy
    Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
    income, common stockholder’s equity, and cash flows of
    Consumers Energy Company (a Michigan Corporation and
    wholly-owned subsidiary of CMS Energy Corporation) for the year
    ended December 31, 2006. Our audit also included the
    financial statement schedule as it relates to 2006 listed in the
    Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audit. We did not
    audit the financial statements of Midland Cogeneration Venture
    Limited Partnership, a former 49% owned variable interest entity
    which has been consolidated through the date of sale,
    November 21, 2006 (Note 3), which statements reflect
    total revenues constituting 9.5% in 2006 of the related
    consolidated totals. Those statements were audited by other
    auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion
    on the consolidated financial statements, insofar as it relates
    to the amounts included for the period indicated above for
    Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership, is based
    solely on the report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audit and the report
    of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other
    auditors, the financial statements referred to above present
    fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated results of
    Consumers Energy Company’s operations and its cash flows
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial
    statements, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
    132(R),” the Company changed its method of accounting for
    the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans in 2006.

ITEM 9A. CMS
    ENERGY’S CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
    and Procedures:

Under the supervision and with the
    participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMS
    Energy conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and
    procedures (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, CMS
    Energy’s CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
    2008.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting:

CMS Energy’s management is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

CMS Energy’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    GAAP and includes policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of CMS Energy;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of CMS
    Energy are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of CMS Energy; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of CMS
    Energy’s assets that could have a material effect on its
    financial statements.

Management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its
    internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all
    fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
    design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
    resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
    considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation
    of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those
    internal controls may become inadequate in future periods
    because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including its CEO and CFO, CMS Energy conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this
    evaluation, management used the criteria set forth in the
    framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, CMS Energy’s
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008. The
    effectiveness of CMS Energy’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
    under Item 8.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting:

There have been no changes in CMS
    Energy’s internal control over financial reporting during
    the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its
    internal control over financial reporting.

    CONSUMERS’ CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
    and Procedures:

Under the supervision and with the
    participation of management, including its CEO and CFO,
    Consumers conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and
    procedures (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation,
    Consumers’ CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
    2008.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting:

Consumers’ management is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Consumers’ internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    GAAP and includes policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of Consumers;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of
    Consumers are being made only in accordance with authorizations
    of management and directors of Consumers; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
    Consumers’ assets that could have a material effect on its
    financial statements.

Management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its
    internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all
    fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
    design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
    resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be

    of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those
    internal controls may become inadequate in future periods
    because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including its CEO and CFO, Consumers conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this
    evaluation, management used the criteria set forth in the
    framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework

    effectiveness of Consumers’ internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under
    Item 8.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting:

There have been no changes in
    Consumers’ internal control over financial reporting during
    the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially

CMS
    Energy — Parent Company

Notes to Condensed
    Financial Statements

1:

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Corporate Structure and Basis of Presentation:

CMS
    Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. We
    are the parent holding company of Consumers Energy and
    Enterprises. The condensed financial statements of CMS
    Energy — Parent Company reflect the investments in
    wholly owned subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting.

Use of Estimates:

CMS Energy is required to make
    estimates using assumptions that may affect the reported amounts
    and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates. We record estimated liabilities for contingencies in
    our condensed financial statements when it is probable that a
    loss will be incurred in the future as a result of a current
    event, and when an amount can be reasonably estimated.

2:

Contingencies

Securities Class Action Lawsuits:

On
    January 3, 2007, CMS Energy and other parties entered into
    a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) dated
    December 28, 2006, subject to court approval, regarding
    settlement of the two class action lawsuits. The settlement was
    approved by a special committee of independent directors and by
    the full board of directors. Both judged that it was in the best
    interests of shareholders to eliminate this business
    uncertainty. Under the terms of the MOU, the litigation settled
    for a total of $200 million, including the cost of
    administering the settlement and any attorney fees the court
    awards. On September 6, 2007, the court issued a final
    order approving the settlement. CMS Energy made a payment of
    approximately $123 million plus interest on the settlement
    balance on September 20, 2007. CMS Energy’s insurers
    paid approximately $77 million, the balance of the
    settlement amount, directly to the settlement account. In
    entering into the MOU, CMS Energy made no admission of liability
    under the two class action lawsuits.

3:

Financings

Long-term debt, including current maturities was
    $1.804 billion at December 31, 2008 and
    $1.559 billion at December 31, 2007. Long-term
    debt — related parties was $178 million at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007.

At December 31, 2008, the annual maturities for long-term
    debt and long-term debt — related parties for the next
    five years are:
