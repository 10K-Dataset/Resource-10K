    Saginaw. Consumers’ electric utility customer base
    comprises a mix of residential, commercial and diversified
    industrial customers, the largest segment of which is the
    automotive industry (which represents 5 percent of
    Consumers’ revenues). Consumers’ electric utility
    operations are not dependent upon a single customer, or even a
    few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few such
    customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse
    effect on its financial condition.

Consumers’ electric utility operations are seasonal. The
    summer months typically increase the use of electric energy,
    primarily due to the use of air conditioners and other cooling
    equipment. In 2007, Consumers’ electric deliveries were
    39 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of
    1 billion kWh. In 2006, Consumers’ electric deliveries
    were 38 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of
    1 billion kWh.

Consumers’ 2007 summer peak demand was 8,183 MW
    excluding ROA loads and 8,391 MW including ROA loads. For
    the

2006-07

winter period, Consumers’ peak demand was 5,985 MW
    excluding ROA loads and 6,178 MW including ROA loads.
    Alternative electric suppliers were providing generation
    services to ROA customers of 315 MW at December 31,
    2007 and 300 MW at December 31, 2006. Consumers had an
    11 percent Reserve Margin target for summer 2007.
    Consumers owns or controls capacity necessary to supply
    approximately 118 percent of projected firm peak load for
    summer 2008.

In 2007, through the Midwest Energy Market, long-term purchase
    contracts, options, spot market and other seasonal purchases,
    Consumers purchased up to 3,979 MW of net capacity from
    others, which amounted to 49 percent of Consumers’
    total system requirements.

Consumers has four generating plant sites that burn coal. In
    2007, these plants produced a combined total of
    17,903 million kWh of electricity, which represents
    90 percent of Consumers’ 19,863 million kWh
    baseload supply, the capacity used to serve a constant level of
    customer demand. These plants burned 9.4 million tons of
    coal in 2007. On December 31, 2007, Consumers had on hand a

50-day

supply of coal.

Consumers has entered into coal supply contracts with various
    suppliers and associated rail transportation contracts for its
    coal-fired generating plants. Under the terms of these
    agreements, Consumers is obligated to take physical delivery of
    the coal and make payment based upon the contract terms.
    Consumers’ coal supply contracts expire through 2010 and
    total an estimated $376 million. Its coal transportation
    contracts expire through 2009 and total an estimated
    $263 million. Long-term coal supply contracts have
    accounted for approximately 60 to 90 percent of
    Consumers’ annual coal requirements over the last
    10 years. Consumers believes that it is within the
    historical 60 to 90 percent range.

At December 31, 2007, Consumers had future unrecognized
    commitments to purchase capacity and energy under long-term
    power purchase agreements with various generating plants. These
    contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the
    plants’ availability or deliverability. These payments for
    2008 through 2030 total an


estimated $21.025 billion. This amount may vary depending
    upon plant availability and fuel costs. Consumers is obligated
    to pay capacity charges based upon the amount of capacity
    available at a given time, whether or not power is delivered to
    Consumers.

Consumers
    Gas Utility

Gas
    Utility Operations

Consumers’ gas utility operating revenue was
    $2.621 billion in 2007, $2.374 billion in 2006, and
    $2.483 billion in 2005. Consumers’ gas utility
    operations purchase, transport, store, distribute and sell
    natural gas. Consumers is authorized to provide service in 46 of
    the 68 counties in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Principal
    cities served include Bay City, Flint, Jackson, Kalamazoo,
    Lansing, Pontiac and Saginaw, as well as the suburban Detroit
    area, where nearly 900,000 of Consumers’ gas customers are
    located. Consumers’ gas utility operations are not
    dependent upon a single customer, or even a few customers, and
    the loss of any one or even a few such customers is not
    reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its
    financial condition.

Consumers’ gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers
    injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for
    use during the winter months when the demand for natural gas is
    higher. Peak demand occurs in the winter due to colder
    temperatures and the resulting use of heating fuels. In 2007,
    deliveries of natural gas sold through Consumers’ pipeline
    and distribution network totaled 347 bcf.

Gas Utility Properties:

Consumers’ gas
    distribution and transmission system located throughout
    Michigan’s Lower Peninsula consists of:

•

26,404 miles of distribution mains;

•

1,669 miles of transmission lines;

•

7 compressor stations with a total of 162,000 installed
    horsepower; and

•

15 gas storage fields with an aggregate storage capacity of 308
    bcf and a working storage capacity of 143 bcf.

Gas Supply:

In 2007, Consumers purchased
    67 percent of the gas it delivered from United States
    producers and 25 percent from Canadian producers.
    Authorized suppliers in the gas customer choice program supplied
    the remaining 8 percent of gas that Consumers delivered.

Consumers’ firm gas transportation agreements are with ANR
    Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, L.P., Trunkline
    Gas Co., Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, and Vector
    Pipeline. Consumers uses these agreements to deliver gas to
    Michigan for ultimate deliveries to market. Consumers’ firm
    transportation and city gate arrangements are capable of
    delivering over ninety percent of Consumers’ total gas
    supply requirements. As of December 31, 2007,
    Consumers’ portfolio of firm transportation from pipelines
    to Michigan is as follows:

Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under
    incremental firm transportation contracts, firm city gate
    contracts and, as needed, interruptible transportation
    contracts. The amount of interruptible transportation service
    and its use vary primarily with the price for such service and
    the availability and price of the spot supplies being purchased
    and transported. Consumers’ use of interruptible
    transportation is generally in off-peak summer months and after
    Consumers has fully utilized the services under the firm
    transportation agreements.

Enterprises

Enterprises, through various subsidiaries and certain equity
    investments, is engaged primarily in domestic independent power
    production. Enterprises’ operating revenue included in
    Continuing Operations in our consolidated financial statements
    was $383 million in 2007, $438 million in 2006, and
    $693 million in 2005. Operating revenue included in
    Discontinued Operations in our consolidated financial statements
    was $235 million in 2007, $684 million in 2006, and
    $409 million in 2005.

In 2007, Enterprises made a significant change in business
    strategy by exiting the international marketplace and refocusing
    its business strategy to concentrate on its independent power
    business in the United States.

Independent Power
    Production

CMS Generation was formed in 1986. It invested in and
    operated non-utility power generation plants in the United
    States and abroad. The independent power production business
    segment’s operating revenue included in Continuing
    Operations in our consolidated financial statements was
    $41 million in 2007, $103 million in 2006, and
    $104 million in 2005. Operating revenue included in
    Discontinued Operations in our consolidated financial statements
    was $124 million in 2007, $437 million in 2006, and
    $211 million in 2005. In 2007, Enterprises sold CMS
    Generation and all of its international assets and power
    production facilities and transferred its domestic independent
    power plant operations to its subsidiary, Hydra-Co. For more

In 2004, CMS ERM changed its name from CMS Marketing, Services
    and Trading Company to CMS Energy Resource Management Company.
    Also, in 2004, CMS ERM discontinued its natural gas retail
    program as customer contracts expired.

CMS ERM purchases and sells energy commodities in support of CMS
    Energy’s generating facilities. In 2007, CMS ERM marketed
    approximately 38 bcf of natural gas and 2,687 GWh of
    electricity. Its operating revenue was $342 million in
    2007, $334 million in 2006, and $589 million in 2005.

International
    Energy Distribution

The international energy distribution business segment’s
    operating revenue, all of which was reflected in Discontinued
    Operations in our consolidated financial statements, was
    $108 million in 2007, $230 million in 2006, and
    $180 million in 2005. In April 2007, CMS Energy sold its
    ownership interest in SENECA. In June 2007, CMS Energy sold

CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS REGULATION

CMS Energy is a public utility holding company that was
    previously exempt from registration under the PUHCA of 1935. The
    PUHCA of 1935 was repealed and replaced by the Energy Policy Act
    of 2005, effective February 8, 2006. CMS Energy, Consumers
    and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various
    federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies,
    including those described in the following sections.

Michigan Public
    Service Commission

Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which
    regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail
    utility rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities
    and other matters.

The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, and the MPSC staff
    typically intervene in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers and
    appeal most significant MPSC orders. Certain appeals of the MPSC
    orders are pending in the Court of Appeals.


Rate Proceedings:

In 2005, the MPSC issued an order
    that established the electric authorized rate of return on
    common equity at 11.15 percent. During 2007, we filed an
    electric rate case with the MPSC requesting an
    11.25 percent authorized rate of return, which is still
    pending. In August 2007, the MPSC approved a partial settlement
    agreement for our 2007 gas rate case, which established the gas
    authorized rate of return on common equity at
    10.75 percent. This proceeding is still pending with the
    MPSC. In February 2008, we filed a gas rate case with the MPSC
    requesting an 11 percent authorized rate of return.

The PSCR and GCR processes allow for recovery of reasonable and
    prudent power supply and gas costs. The MPSC reviews these costs
    for reasonableness and prudency in annual plan proceedings and
    in plan reconciliation proceedings. For additional information,
    see ITEM 8. CMS ENERGY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
    SUPPLEMENTARY DATA — NOTE 3 OF CMS ENERGY’S
    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    (CONTINGENCIES) — CONSUMERS’ ELECRIC UTILITY RATE
    MATTERS and CONSUMERS’ GAS UTILITY RATE MATTERS and

    SUPPLEMENTARY DATA — NOTE 3 OF CONSUMERS’
    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    (CONTINGENCIES) — ELECTRIC RATE MATTERS and GAS RATE
    MATTERS.

MPSC Regulation and Michigan Legislation:

Effective
    January 2002, the Customer Choice Act provided that all electric
    customers have the choice to buy generation service from an
    alternative electric supplier. The Customer Choice Act also
    imposed rate reductions, rate freezes and rate caps, which
    expired at the end of 2005. The Michigan legislature introduced
    several bills in December 2007 that would significantly reform
    the Customer Choice Act. For additional information regarding
    the Customer Choice Act, see ITEM 7. CMS ENERGY’S
    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS —
    OUTLOOK — ELECTRIC UTILITY BUSINESS
    UNCERTAINTIES — ELECTRIC ROA and ITEM 7.
    CONSUMERS’ MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS — OUTLOOK — ELECTRIC BUSINESS
    UNCERTAINTIES — ELECTRIC ROA.

Consumers transports some of the natural gas it sells to
    customers through facilities owned by competitors including gas
    producers, marketers and others. Pursuant to a self implemented
    gas customer choice program that began in April 2003, all of
    Consumers’ gas customers are eligible to select an
    alternative gas commodity supplier.

Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission

The FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several
    independent power plants in which Enterprises has ownership
    interests, as well as over CMS ERM and DIG. Among other things,
    FERC has jurisdiction over acquisitions, operation and disposal
    of certain assets and facilities, services provided and rates
    charged, and limited jurisdiction over other holding company
    matters with respect to CMS Energy. Some of Consumers’ gas
    business is also subject to regulation by the FERC, including a
    blanket transportation tariff pursuant to which Consumers may
    transport gas in interstate commerce.

The FERC also regulates certain aspects of Consumers’
    electric operations including compliance with FERC accounting
    rules, wholesale rates, operation of licensed hydro-electric
    generating plants, transfers of certain facilities, and
    corporate mergers and issuance of securities.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 modified the FERC’s
    responsibilities, which affects both Consumers and Enterprises.
    The new law repeals the PUHCA of 1935, streamlines electric
    transmission siting rules, promotes wholesale competition and
    investment, and requires mandatory electric supply reliability
    planning. In addition, the 2005 Act gave the FERC the authority
    to require a wide range of activities to improve the bulk power
    system’s reliability. During 2007, more than ninety new
    regulations in this area went into effect.

The FERC is currently in the process of establishing standards
    for ensuring a more reliable system of providing electricity
    throughout North America through increased regulation of
    generation owners and operators, load serving entities, and
    others.

Other
    Regulation

The Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural
    gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to
    the FERC and the DOE’s Office of Fossil Fuels.


Consumers’ pipelines are subject to the Natural Gas
    Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and the Pipeline Safety Improvement
    Act of 2002, which regulate the safety of gas pipelines.

CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

CMS Energy, Consumers and their subsidiaries are subject to
    various federal, state and local regulations for environmental
    quality, including air and water quality, waste management,
    zoning and other matters.

CMS Energy has a recorded a significant liability for its
    obligations associated with Bay Harbor. For additional
    information, see ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
    SUPPLEMENTARY DATA — NOTE 3 (CONTINGENCIES) OF
    CMS ENERGY’S NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS and ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

Consumers has installed and is currently installing modern
    emission controls at its electric generating plants and has
    converted and is converting electric generating units to burn
    cleaner fuels. Consumers expects that the cost of future
    environmental compliance, especially compliance with clean air
    laws, will be significant because of EPA regulations and
    proposed regulations regarding nitrogen oxide,
    particulate-related emissions, and mercury. Consumers will spend
    $835 million through 2015 to comply with the Clean Air
    Interstate Rule and will spend $480 million through 2015 to
    comply with the State of Michigan’s proposed mercury plan.

Consumers completed the closure of an ash landfill at one plant
    in 2007 and is awaiting MDEQ certification of that closure.
    Consumers is also in the process of closing some older areas at
    an ash landfill at another plant. Construction, operation, and
    closure of a modern solid waste disposal area for ash can be
    expensive because of strict federal and state requirements. In
    order to significantly reduce ash field closure costs, Consumers
    has worked with others to use bottom ash and fly ash as part of
    a temporary and final cover for ash disposal areas instead of
    native materials, in cases where such use of bottom ash and fly
    ash is compatible with environmental standards. To reduce
    disposal volumes, Consumers sells coal ash for use as a Portland
    cement replacement in concrete products, as a filler for
    asphalt, as feedstock for the manufacture of Portland cement and
    for other environmentally compatible uses. The EPA has announced
    its intention to develop new nationwide standards for ash
    disposal areas. Consumers intends to work through industry
    groups to help ensure that any such regulations require only the
    minimum cost necessary to adhere to standards that are
    consistent with protection of the environment.

Consumers’ electric generating plants must comply with
    rules that significantly reduce the number of fish killed by
    plant cooling water intake systems. Consumers is studying
    options to determine the most cost-effective solutions for
    compliance.

Like most electric utilities, Consumers has PCB in some of its
    electrical equipment. During routine maintenance activities,
    Consumers identified PCB as a component in certain paint, grout
    and sealant materials at the Ludington Pumped Storage facility.
    Consumers removed and replaced part of the PCB material with
    non-PCB material. Consumers has proposed a plan to the EPA to
    deal with the remaining materials and is waiting for a response
    from the EPA.

Certain environmental regulations affecting CMS Energy and
    Consumers include, but are not limited to, the Clean Air Act
    Amendments of 1990 and Superfund. Superfund can require any
    individual or entity that may have owned or operated a disposal
    site, as well as transporters or generators of hazardous
    substances that were sent to such a site, to share in
    remediation costs for the site.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ current insurance program
    does not extend to cover the risks of certain environmental
    cleanup costs or environmental damages, such as claims for air
    pollution, damage to sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, and
    for some past PCB contamination, and for some long-term storage
    or disposal of pollutants.

CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS COMPETITION

Electric
    Competition

Consumers’ electric utility business experiences actual and
    potential competition from many sources, both in the wholesale
    and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric
    delivery, and retail services.

Michigan’s Customer Choice Act gives all electric customers
    the right to buy generation service from an alternative electric
    supplier. In January 2006, the MPSC approved cost-based ROA
    distribution tariffs. A significant decrease in retail electric
    competition occurred in 2005 due to changes in market
    conditions, including increased uncertainty and volatility in
    fuel commodity prices. Energy market volatility continued into
    2006. At December 31, 2007, alternative electric suppliers
    were providing 315 MW of generation service to ROA
    customers. This amount represents an increase of 5 percent
    compared to December 31, 2006, and is 4 percent of
    Consumers’ total distribution load. It is difficult to
    predict future ROA customer trends.

In addition to retail electric customer choice, Consumers has
    competition or potential competition from:

•

industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their
    production capacity outside Consumers’ service territory
    for economic reasons;

•

municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery
    systems;

•

customer self-generation; and

•

adjacent utilities that extend lines to customers in contiguous
    service territories.

Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in
    adjacent areas and enforcing compliance with MPSC and FERC
    rules, providing non-energy services, and providing tariff-based
    incentives that support economic development.

Consumers offers non-energy revenue-producing services to
    electric customers, municipalities and other utilities in an
    effort to offset costs. These services include engineering and
    consulting, construction of customer-owned distribution
    facilities, sales of equipment (such as transformers), power
    quality analysis, energy management services, meter reading, and
    joint construction for phone and cable. Consumers faces
    competition from many sources, including energy management
    services companies, other utilities, contractors, and retail
    merchandisers.

CMS ERM, a non-utility electric subsidiary, continues to focus
    on optimizing CMS Energy’s independent power production
    portfolio. CMS Energy’s independent power production
    business, a non-utility electric subsidiary, faces competition
    from generators, marketers and brokers, as well as other
    utilities marketing power at lower prices on the wholesale
    market.

For additional information concerning electric competition, see
    ITEM 7. CMS ENERGY’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS — OUTLOOK — ELECTRIC UTILITY
    BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES and ITEM 7. CONSUMERS’
    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS —
    OUTLOOK — ELECTRIC BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES.

Gas
    Competition

Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas
    utility business, and is likely to increase. Competition comes
    from other gas suppliers taking advantage of direct access to
    Consumers’ customers and from alternative fuels and energy
    sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.

INSURANCE

CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain
    insurance coverage similar to comparable companies in the same
    lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms,
    conditions, limitations and exclusions that might not fully
    compensate CMS Energy for all losses. A portion of each loss is
    generally assumed by CMS Energy in the form of deductibles and
    self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As
    CMS Energy renews its policies it is possible that some of the
    current insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on
    commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance
    markets.

    ITEM 1. BUSINESS — CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS
    ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE.

ITEM 1A. RISK
    FACTORS

Actual results in future periods for CMS Energy and consolidated
    Consumers could differ materially from historical results and
    the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors
    that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but
    are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections.
    The companies’ business is influenced by many factors that
    are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may
    materially affect actual results and are often beyond the
    companies’ control. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known or that the companies’ management currently
    believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the
    companies. The risk factors described in the following sections,
    as well as the other information included in this annual report
    and in the other documents filed with the SEC, should be
    carefully considered before making an investment in securities
    of CMS Energy and Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also
    risk factors for CMS Energy.

Risks
    Related to CMS Energy

CMS
    Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its
    debt service obligations.

Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on
    dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations.
    Restrictions contained in Consumers’ preferred stock
    provisions and other legal restrictions, such as certain terms
    in its articles of incorporation, limit Consumers’ ability
    to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy. At
    December 31, 2007, Consumers had $269 million of
    unrestricted retained earnings available to pay common stock
    dividends. If sufficient dividends are not paid to CMS Energy by
    its subsidiaries, CMS Energy may not be able to generate the
    funds necessary to fulfill its cash obligations, thereby
    adversely affecting its liquidity and financial condition.

CMS
    Energy has substantial indebtedness that could limit its
    financial flexibility and hence its ability to meet its debt
    service obligations.

As of December 31, 2007, CMS Energy had $1.891 billion
    aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, including
    $178 million of subordinated indebtedness relating to its
    convertible preferred securities. $4.374 billion of
    subsidiary debt is not included in the preceding total. In April
    2007, CMS Energy entered into the Seventh Amended and Restated
    Credit Agreement providing revolving credit and commitments in
    the amount of $300 million, which was increased to
    $550 million in January 2008. As of December 31, 2007,
    there were $278 million of letters of credit outstanding
    under the Seventh Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. CMS
    Energy and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in
    the future.

The level of CMS Energy’s present and future indebtedness
    could have several important effects on its future operations,
    including, among others:

•

a significant portion of its cash flow from operations will be
    dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its
    indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes;

•

covenants contained in its existing debt arrangements require it
    to meet certain financial tests, which may affect its
    flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its
    business;

•

its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital,
    capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and
    other purposes may be limited;

•

it may be at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that
    are less leveraged; and

•

its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions
    may increase.

CMS Energy’s ability to meet its debt service obligations
    and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future
    performance, which will be subject to general economic
    conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other
    factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its
    control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances that its business
    will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations
    to service its indebtedness. If it is unable to generate
    sufficient cash flows from operations, it may be required to
    sell additional assets or obtain additional financing. CMS
    Energy cannot assure that additional financing will be available
    on commercially acceptable terms or at all.


CMS
    Energy cannot predict the outcome of claims regarding its
    participation in the development of Bay Harbor or other
    litigation in which substantial monetary claims are
    involved.

As part of the development of Bay Harbor by certain subsidiaries
    of CMS Energy, pursuant to an agreement with the MDEQ, third
    parties constructed a golf course and park over several
    abandoned CKD piles, left over from the former cement plant
    operations on the Bay Harbor site. The third parties also
    undertook a series of remedial actions, including removing
    abandoned buildings and equipment; consolidating, shaping and
    covering CKD piles with soil and vegetation; removing CKD from
    streams and beaches; and constructing a leachate collection
    system at an identified seep. Leachate is formed when water
    passes through CKD. In 2002, CMS Energy sold its interest in Bay
    Harbor, but retained its obligations under environmental
    indemnifications entered into at the start of the project.

In September 2004, the MDEQ issued a notice of noncompliance
    after finding high-pH leachate in Lake Michigan adjacent to the
    property. The MDEQ also alleged higher than acceptable levels of
    heavy metals, including mercury, in the leachate flow.

In 2005, the EPA along with CMS Land and CMS Capital executed an
    AOC and approved a Removal Action Work Plan to address problems
    at Bay Harbor. Among other things, the plan called for the
    installation of collection trenches to capture high-pH leachate
    flow to the lake. Collection systems required under the plan
    have been installed and shoreline monitoring is ongoing. CMS
    Land and CMS Capital are required to address observed
    exceedances in pH, including required enhancements of the
    collection system. In May 2006, the EPA approved a pilot carbon
    dioxide enhancement plan to improve pH results in a specific
    area of the collection system. The enhanced system was installed
    in June 2006. CMS Land and CMS Capital also engaged in other
    enhancements of the installed collection systems.

In November 2007, the EPA sent CMS Land and CMS Capital a letter
    identifying three separate areas representing approximately
    700 feet of shoreline in which the EPA claimed pH levels
    were unacceptable. The letter also took the position that CMS
    Land and CMS Capital are required to remedy the claimed
    noncompliance. CMS Land and CMS Capital submitted a formal
    objection to the EPA’s conclusions. In their objections,
    CMS Land and CMS Capital noted that the AOC did not require
    perfection and that over 97 percent of the measured pH
    levels were in the correct range. Further, the limited number of
    exceedances were not much above the pH nine level set by the AOC
    and posed no threat to the public health and safety. In
    addition, CMS Land and CMS Capital noted in their objection that
    the actions they had already taken fully complied with the terms
    of the AOC. In January 2008, the EPA advised CMS Land and CMS
    Capital that it had rejected their objections, and that CMS Land
    and CMS Capital were obligated to submit a plan to augment
    measures to collect high pH leachate under the terms of the
    November 2007 EPA letter as modified in the January 2008 letter.
    CMS Land and CMS Capital submitted a proposed augmentation plan
    in February 2008.

In February 2006, CMS Land and CMS Capital submitted to the EPA
    a proposed Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RIFS)
    for one of the CKD piles known as the East Park CKD pile. A
    similar RIFS is planned to be submitted for the remaining CKD
    piles in 2008. The EPA approved a schedule for near-term
    activities, which includes consolidating certain CKD materials
    and installing collection trenches in the East Park leachate
    release area. In June 2006, the EPA approved an East Park CKD
    Removal Action Work Plan and Final Engineering Design for
    Consolidation. However, the EPA has not approved the RIFS for
    the East Park.

As a result of the installation of collection systems at the Bay
    Harbor sites, CMS Land and CMS Capital are collecting and
    treating 135,000 gallons of liquid per day and shipping it by
    truck for disposal at a nearby well and at a municipal
    wastewater treatment plant located in Traverse City, Michigan.
    To address both short term and longer-term disposal of liquid,
    CMS Land has filed two permit applications with the MDEQ and the
    EPA, the first to treat the collected leachate at the Bay Harbor
    sites before releasing the water to Lake Michigan and the second
    to dispose of it in a deep injection well in Alba, Michigan,
    that CMS Land or its affiliate would own and operate. In
    February 2008, the MDEQ and the EPA granted permits for CMS Land
    or its affiliate to construct and operate a deep injection well
    near Alba, Michigan in eastern Antrim County. Certain
    environmental groups and a local township have indicated they
    may challenge these permits before the agencies or the courts.


CMS Land and CMS Capital, the MDEQ, and the EPA have ongoing
    discussions concerning the long-term remedy for the Bay Harbor
    sites. These negotiations are addressing, among other things,
    issues relating to the disposal of leachate, the location and
    design of collection lines and upstream diversion of water,
    potential flow of leachate below the collection system,
    applicable criteria for various substances such as mercury, and
    other matters that are likely to affect the scope of remedial
    work CMS Land and CMS Capital may be obliged to undertake.
    Negotiations have been ongoing for over a year, but CMS Land and
    CMS Capital have not been able to resolve these issues with the
    regulators and they remain pending.

CMS Land has entered into various access, purchase and
    settlement agreements with several of the affected landowners at
    Bay Harbor, and entered into a confidential settlement with one
    landowner to resolve a lawsuit filed by that landowner. We have
    received demands for indemnification relating to claims made by
    a property owner at Bay Harbor. CMS Land has purchased five
    unimproved lots and two lots with houses.

CMS Energy has recorded a cumulative charge of
    $140 million, which includes accretion expense, for its
    obligations. An adverse outcome of this matter could, depending
    on the size of any indemnification obligation or liability under
    environmental laws, have a potentially significant adverse
    effect on CMS Energy’s financial condition and liquidity
    and could negatively impact CMS Energy’s results of
    operations. CMS Energy cannot predict the financial impact or
    outcome of this matter.

CMS
    Energy retains contingent liabilities in connection with its
    asset sales.

The agreements CMS Energy enters into for the sale of assets
    customarily include provisions whereby it is required to:

•

retain specified preexisting liabilities such as for taxes,
    pensions, or environmental conditions;

•

indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the
    inaccuracy of representations and warranties it makes; and

•

make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of
    post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits or other reviews.

Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for
    extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending
    on the extent to which the buyers may ultimately seek to enforce
    their rights under these contractual provisions, and the
    resolution of any disputes CMS Energy may have concerning them,
    these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on its
    financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations.

Risks
    Related to CMS Energy and Consumers

CMS
    Energy and Consumers have financing needs and they may be unable
    to obtain bank financing or access the capital
    markets.

CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands
    pursuant to commercial commitments under guarantees, indemnities
    and letters of credit.

CMS Energy continues to explore financing opportunities to
    supplement its financial plan. These potential opportunities
    include: entering into leasing arrangements and refinancing

and/or

issuing new capital markets debt, preferred stock

and/or

common equity. CMS Energy cannot guarantee the capital
    markets’ acceptance of its securities or predict the impact
    of factors beyond its control, such as actions of rating
    agencies. If CMS Energy is unable to obtain bank financing or
    access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness,
    there could be a material adverse effect upon its financial
    condition, liquidity or results of operations. Similarly,
    Consumers currently plans to seek funds through the capital
    markets and commercial lenders. Entering into new financings is
    subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility
    industry securities in general and to Consumers’ securities
    issuances in particular. Consumers cannot guarantee the capital
    markets’ acceptance of its securities or predict the impact
    of factors beyond its control, such as actions of rating
    agencies. If Consumers is unable to obtain bank financing or
    access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness,
    there could be a material adverse effect upon its liquidity and
    operations.


Certain of CMS Energy’s securities and those of its
    affiliates, including Consumers, are rated by various credit
    rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of
    its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS
    Energy’s or Consumers’ ability to access capital on
    acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit and
    could make its cost of borrowing higher. If it is unable to
    maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy may have to post
    collateral or make prepayments to certain of its suppliers
    pursuant to existing contracts with them. In addition, certain
    bonds of Consumers are supported by municipal bond insurance
    policies, and the interest rates on those bonds have been
    affected by ratings downgrades of bond insurers. Further, any
    adverse developments to Consumers, which provides dividends to
    CMS Energy, that result in a lowering of Consumers’ credit
    ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy’s credit
    ratings. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of
    their current ratings will remain in effect for any given period
    of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
    entirely by a rating agency.

Regulatory
    changes and other developments have resulted and could continue
    to result in increased competition in the domestic energy
    business. Generally, increased competition threatens market
    share in certain segments of CMS Energy’s business and can
    reduce its and Consumers’ profitability.

As of January 1, 2002, the Customer Choice Act allows all
    electric customers in Michigan the choice of buying electric
    generation service from Consumers or an alternative electric
    supplier. Consumers had experienced, and could experience in the
    future, a significant increase in competition for generation
    services due to ROA. At December 31, 2007, alternative
    electric suppliers were providing 315 MW of generation
    service to ROA customers. This amount represents 4 percent
    of Consumers’ total distribution load, which is down from a
    high of 12 percent in 2004. Consumers cannot predict the
    total amount of electric supply load that may be lost to
    competitor suppliers in the future.

Electric
    industry regulation could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ business, including their ability to recover
    costs from their customers.

Federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed
    dramatically in the last two decades and could continue to
    change over the next several years. These changes could
    adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ business,
    financial condition and profitability.

There are multiple proceedings pending before the FERC involving
    transmission rates, regional transmission organizations and
    electric bulk power markets and transmission. FERC is also
    reviewing the standards under which electric utilities are
    allowed to participate in wholesale power markets without price
    restrictions. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact
    of these electric industry restructuring proceedings on their
    financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers could incur significant capital
    expenditures to comply with environmental standards and face
    difficulty in recovering these costs on a current
    basis.

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to
    costly and increasingly stringent environmental regulations.
    They expect that the cost of future environmental compliance,
    especially compliance with clean air and water laws, will be
    significant.

In March 2005, the EPA adopted the Clean Air Interstate Rule
    that requires additional coal-fired electric generating plant
    emission controls for nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.
    Consumers plans to meet the nitrogen oxides requirements by
    installing equipment that reduces nitrogen oxides emissions and
    purchasing emissions allowances. Consumers also will meet the
    sulfur dioxide requirements by injecting a chemical that reduces
    sulfur dioxide emissions, installing scrubbers and purchasing
    emission allowances. Consumers plans to spend an additional
    $835 million for equipment installation through 2015.

In March 2005, the EPA issued the CAMR, which requires initial
    reductions of mercury emissions from coal-fired electric
    generating plants by 2010 and further reductions by 2018.
    Certain portions of the CAMR were appealed to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by a
    number of states and other entities. The U.S. Court of
    Appeals for the District of Columbia decided the case on
    February 8, 2008, and determined that the


rules developed by the EPA were not consistent with the Clean
    Air Act. CMS Energy and Consumers continue to monitor the
    development of federal regulations in this area.

In April 2006, Michigan’s governor proposed a plan that
    would result in mercury emissions reductions of 90 percent
    by 2015. We are working with the MDEQ on the details of this
    plan; however, we have developed preliminary cost estimates and
    a mercury emissions reduction scenario based on our best
    knowledge of control technology options and initially proposed
    requirements. We estimate that costs associated with Phase I of
    the state’s mercury plan will be approximately
    $220 million by 2010 and an additional $200 million by
    2015.

The EPA has alleged that some utilities have incorrectly
    classified plant modifications as “routine
    maintenance” rather than seeking permits from the EPA to
    modify their plants. Consumers responded to information requests
    from the EPA on this subject in 2000, 2002, and 2006. Consumers
    believes that it has properly interpreted the requirements of
    “routine maintenance.” If the EPA finds that its
    interpretation is incorrect, Consumers could be required to
    install additional pollution controls at some or all of its
    coal-fired electric generating plants and pay fines.
    Additionally, Consumers would need to assess the viability of
    continuing operations at certain plants.

Several legislative proposals have been introduced in the United
    States Congress that would require reductions in emissions of
    greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. These laws, or
    similar state laws or rules, if enacted, could require Consumers
    to replace equipment, install additional equipment for pollution
    controls, purchase allowances, curtail operations, or take other
    steps.

CMS Energy and Consumers expect to collect fully from its
    customers, through the ratemaking process, these and other
    required environmental expenditures. However, if these
    expenditures are not recovered from customers in Consumers’
    rates, CMS Energy

and/or

Consumers may be required to seek significant additional
    financing to fund these expenditures, which could strain their
    cash resources. We can give no assurances that CMS Energy

and/or

Consumers will have access to bank financing or capital markets
    to fund any such environmental expenditures.

Market
    performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit
    plan assets, which then could require significant
    funding.

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of
    assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations
    under CMS Energy’s pension and postretirement benefit
    plans. CMS Energy has significant obligations in this area and
    holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are
    subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns,
    which may fall below CMS Energy’s forecasted return rates.
    A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the
    funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in
    demographics, including increased number of retirements or
    changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the
    funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension
    and postretirement benefit plans. If CMS Energy is unable to
    successfully manage its pension and postretirement plan assets,
    its results of operations and financial position could be
    affected negatively.

Periodic
    reviews of the values of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    assets could result in accounting charges.

CMS Energy and Consumers are required by GAAP to review
    periodically the carrying value of their assets, including those
    that may be sold. Market conditions, the operational
    characteristics of their assets and other factors could result
    in recording additional impairment charges for their assets,
    which could have an adverse effect on their stockholders’
    equity and their access to additional financing. In addition,
    they may be required to record impairment charges at the time
    they sell assets, depending on the sale prices they are able to
    secure and other factors.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers may be adversely affected by regulatory
    investigations regarding “round-trip” trading by CMS
    MST as well as civil lawsuits regarding pricing information that
    CMS MST and CMS Field Services provided to market
    publications.

As a result of round-trip trading transactions (simultaneous,
    prearranged commodity trading transactions in which energy
    commodities were sold and repurchased at the same price) at CMS
    MST, CMS Energy is under


investigation by the DOJ. CMS Energy received subpoenas in 2002
    and 2003 from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices regarding
    investigations of those trades. CMS Energy responded to those
    subpoenas in 2003 and 2004.

In March 2004, the SEC approved a

cease-and-desist

order settling an administrative action against CMS Energy
    relating to round-trip trading. The order did not assess a fine
    and CMS Energy neither admitted nor denied the order’s
    findings.

CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of the
    investigations. It is possible that the outcome in one or more
    of the investigations could, affect adversely CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ financial condition, liquidity or results of
    operations.

CMS
    Energy and Consumers may be adversely affected by regulatory
    investigations and civil lawsuits regarding pricing information
    that CMS MST and CMS Field Services provided to market
    publications.

CMS Energy has notified appropriate regulatory and governmental
    agencies that some employees at CMS MST and CMS Field Services
    appeared to have provided inaccurate information regarding
    natural gas trades to various energy industry publications which
    compile and report index prices. CMS Energy is cooperating with
    an ongoing investigation by the DOJ regarding this matter. CMS
    Energy is unable to predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation
    and what effect, if any, the investigation will have on CMS
    Energy.

CMS Energy, CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas,
    Inc. (the company that purchased CMS Field Services) and Cantera
    Gas Company are named as defendants in various lawsuits arising
    as a result of alleged false natural gas price reporting.
    Allegations include manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures
    and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies, and artificial
    inflation of natural gas retail prices in Colorado, Kansas,
    Missouri, Tennessee, and Wyoming.

CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of the
    investigations. It is possible that the outcome in one or more
    of the investigations could affect adversely CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ financial condition, liquidity or results of
    operations.

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ revenues and results of
    operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control,
    including but not limited to future terrorist attacks or related
    acts of war.

The cost of repairing damage to CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ facilities due to storms, natural disasters,
    wars, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events, in excess of
    insurance recoveries and reserves established for these repairs,
    may adversely impact their results of operations, financial
    condition and cash flows. The occurrence or risk of occurrence
    of future terrorist activity and the high cost or potential
    unavailability of insurance to cover this terrorist activity may
    impact their results of operations and financial condition in
    unpredictable ways. These actions could also result in
    disruptions of power and fuel markets. In addition, their
    natural gas distribution system and pipelines could be directly
    or indirectly harmed by future terrorist activity.

Consumers
    may not prevail in the exercise of its regulatory-out rights
    under the MCV PPA.

The MCV Partnership, which leases and operates the MCV Facility,
    contracted to sell electricity to Consumers for a

35-year

period beginning in 1990. The cost that Consumers incurred under
    the MCV PPA exceeded the recovery amount allowed by the MPSC,
    including $39 million in 2007, until it exercised the
    regulatory-out provision in the MCV PPA in September 2007. This
    action limited its capacity and fixed energy payments to the MCV
    Partnership to the amounts that it collects from its customers.
    However, it uses the direct savings from the RCP, after
    allocating a portion to customers, to offset a portion of its
    capacity and fixed energy underrecoveries expense. The MCV
    Partnership has notified Consumers that it disputes its right to
    exercise the regulatory-out provision. Consumers believes that
    the provision is valid and fully effective, but cannot assure
    that it will prevail in the event of a proceeding on this issue.

As a result of our exercise of the regulatory-out provision, the
    MCV Partnership may, under certain circumstances, have the right
    to terminate or reduce the amount of capacity sold under the MCV
    PPA. If the MCV Partnership terminates the MCV PPA or reduces
    the amount of capacity sold under the MCV PPA, Consumers would
    seek to replace the lost capacity to maintain an adequate
    electric Reserve Margin. This could involve entering


into a new power purchase agreement or entering into electric
    capacity contracts on the open market. Consumers cannot predict
    its ability to enter into such contracts at a reasonable price.
    Consumers also is unable to predict regulatory approval of the
    terms and conditions of such contracts, or that the MPSC would
    allow full recovery of its incurred costs.

CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the financial impact or
    outcome of these matters.

Consumers’
    energy risk management strategies may not be effective in
    managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result
    in unanticipated liabilities to Consumers or increased
    volatility of its earnings.

Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural
    gas, coal, electricity and emission credits. Prices for natural
    gas, coal, electricity and emission credits may fluctuate
    substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose
    Consumers to commodity price risk. A substantial portion of
    Consumers’ operating expenses for its plants consists of
    the costs of obtaining these commodities. Consumers manages
    these risks using established policies and procedures, and it
    may use various contracts to manage these risks, including
    swaps, options, futures and forward contracts. No assurance can
    be made that these strategies will be successful in managing
    Consumers’ pricing risk, or that they will not result in
    net liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in
    these markets.

Natural gas prices in particular have historically been
    volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to offset
    its positions, such as hedging exposure to the risks of demand,
    market effects of weather and changes in commodity prices
    associated with its gas distribution business. These positions
    are taken in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which allows
    Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with
    those positions. However, Consumers does not always hedge the
    entire exposure of its operations from commodity price
    volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to
    commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets.
    As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid,
    Consumers may not be able to execute its risk management
    strategies, which could result in greater open positions than
    preferred at a given time. To the extent that open positions
    exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or worsen CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ financial condition or results
    of operations.

Changes
    in taxation as well as inherent difficulty in quantifying
    potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively
    impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of
    operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments
    regarding the potential tax effects of various financial
    transactions and results of operations in order to estimate
    their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations
    include income, real estate, sales and use taxes,
    employment-related taxes and ongoing issues related to these tax
    matters. The judgments include reserves for potential adverse
    outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that may
    be subject to challenge by IRS

and/or

other
    taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues
    related to these reserves at CMS Energy or Consumers Energy
    could adversely affect their financial condition or results of
    operations.

Consumers
    is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in
    its service territories.

Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are impacted
    by the economic cycles of the customers it serves. In its
    service territories in Michigan, the economy has been sluggish
    and hampered by negative developments in the manufacturing
    industry and limited growth in non-manufacturing sectors of the
    state’s economy. In the event economic conditions in
    Michigan or the region continue to decline, Consumers may
    experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that
    could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition,
    economic conditions in its service territory impact its
    collections of accounts receivable and its financial results.

CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ energy sales and operations
    are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions
    from year to year.

Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are
    generally seasonal businesses. Demand for electricity is greater
    in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and
    heating, and demand for natural gas peaks in the winter heating
    season. Accordingly, its overall results in the future may
    fluctuate substantially on a seasonal


basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and
    winter heating season will negatively impact CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ results of operations and cash flows.

Unplanned
    power plant outages may be costly for Consumers.

Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce
    electricity. As a result of unforeseen maintenance, Consumers
    may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity
    that exceed its costs of generation. Its financial condition or
    results of operations may be negatively affected if it is unable
    to recover those increased costs.

Failure
    to implement successfully new processes and information systems
    could interrupt our operations.

CMS Energy and Consumers depend on numerous information systems
    for operations and financial information and billings. They are
    in the midst of a multi-year company-wide initiative to improve
    existing processes and implement new core information systems.
    Failure to implement successfully new processes and new core
    information systems could interrupt their operations.

Consumers
    may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal, which
    could limit its ability to operate its facilities.

Consumers is dependent on coal for much of its electric
    generating capacity. While Consumers has coal supply and
    transportation contracts in place, there can be no assurance
    that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their
    obligations to supply coal to Consumers. The suppliers under the
    agreements may experience financial or operational problems that
    inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers.
    In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be
    required to supply coal to Consumers under certain
    circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If it
    is unable to obtain its coal requirements under existing or
    future coal supply and transportation contracts, Consumers may
    be required to purchase coal at higher prices, or it may be
    forced to make additional MWh purchases through other
    potentially higher cost generating resources in the Midwest
    energy market. Higher coal costs increase its working capital
    requirements.

SEC
    REQUEST

On August 5, 2004, CMS Energy received a request from the
    SEC that CMS Energy voluntarily produce documents and data
    relating to the SEC’s inquiry into payments made to
    officials or relatives of officials of the government of
    Equatorial Guinea. On August 17, 2004, CMS Energy submitted
    its response, advising the SEC of the information and
    documentation it had available. On March 8, 2005, CMS
    Energy received a request from the SEC that CMS Energy
    voluntarily produce certain of such documents. The SEC
    subsequently issued a formal order of private investigation on
    this matter on August 1, 2005. CMS Energy and several other
    companies that have conducted business in Equatorial Guinea,
    received subpoenas from the SEC to provide documents regarding
    payments made to officials or relatives of officials of the
    government of Equatorial Guinea. CMS Energy is cooperating and
    will continue to produce documents responsive to the subpoena.

GAS INDEX PRICE
    REPORTING LITIGATION

Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc. filed a putative class action lawsuit in
    the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
    California in November 2003 against a number of energy companies
    engaged in the sale of natural gas in the United States
    (including CMS Energy). The complaint alleged defendants entered
    into a price-fixing scheme by engaging in activities to
    manipulate the price of natural gas in California. The complaint
    alleged violations of the federal Sherman Act, the California
    Cartwright Act, and the California Business and Professions Code
    relating to unlawful, unfair and deceptive business practices.
    The complaint sought both actual and exemplary damages for
    alleged overcharges, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief
    regulating defendants’ future conduct relating to pricing
    and price reporting. In April 2004, a Nevada MDL panel ordered
    the transfer of the Texas-Ohio case to a pending MDL matter in
    the Nevada federal district court that at the time involved
    seven complaints originally filed in various state courts in
    California. These complaints make allegations similar to those
    in the Texas-Ohio case regarding price reporting. The court
    issued an order granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss
    on April 8, 2005 and entered a judgment in favor of the
    defendants on April 11, 2005. Texas-Ohio appealed the
    dismissal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

While that appeal was pending, CMS Energy agreed to settle the
    Texas-Ohio case and three others cases originally filed in
    California federal courts (Fairhaven, Abelman Art Glass and
    Utility savings), for a total payment of $700,000. On
    September 10, 2007, the court entered an order granting
    final approval of the settlement and dismissing the CMS Energy
    defendants from these cases. On September 26, 2007, the
    Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of the trial
    judge in the Texas-Ohio case and held that the “filed rate
    doctrine” is not applicable to the claims. The Ninth
    Circuit Court of Appeals then remanded the case to the federal
    district court. While CMS Energy is no longer a party to the
    Texas-Ohio case, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ ruling
    may affect the positions of CMS Energy entities in other pending
    cases.

Commencing in or about February 2004, 15 state law
    complaints containing allegations similar to those made in the
    Texas-Ohio case, but generally limited to the California
    Cartwright Act and unjust enrichment, were filed in various
    California state courts against many of the same defendants
    named in the federal price manipulation cases discussed in the
    preceding paragraphs. In addition to CMS Energy, CMS MST is
    named in all 15 state law complaints. Cantera Gas Company
    and Cantera Natural Gas, LLC (erroneously sued as Cantera
    Natural Gas, Inc.) are named in all but one complaint.

In February 2005, these 15 separate actions, as well as nine
    other similar actions that were filed in California state court
    but do not name CMS Energy or any of its former or current
    subsidiaries, were ordered coordinated with pending coordinated
    proceedings in the San Diego Superior Court. The
    24 state court complaints involving price reporting were
    coordinated as Natural Gas Antitrust Cases V. Plaintiffs in
    Natural Gas Antitrust Cases V were ordered to file a
    consolidated complaint, but a consolidated complaint was filed
    only for the two putative class action lawsuits. Pursuant to a
    ruling dated August 23, 2006, CMS Energy, Cantera Gas
    Company and Cantera Natural Gas, LLC were dismissed as
    defendants in the master class action and the 13

non-class

actions, due to lack


of personal jurisdiction. CMS MST remains a defendant in all of
    these actions. In September 2006, CMS MST reached an agreement
    in principle to settle the master class action for
    $7 million. In March 2007, CMS Energy paid $7 million
    into a trust fund account following preliminary approval of the
    settlement by the judge. On June 12, 2007, the court
    entered a judgment, final order and decree granting final
    approval to the class action settlement with CMS MST. Certain of
    the individual cases filed in the California State Court remain
    pending.

Samuel D. Leggett, et al v. Duke Energy Corporation, et al,
    a class action complaint brought on behalf of retail and
    business purchasers of natural gas in Tennessee, was filed in
    the Chancery Court of Fayette County, Tennessee in January 2005.
    The complaint contains claims for violations of the Tennessee
    Trade Practices Act based upon allegations of false reporting of
    price information by defendants to publications that compile and
    publish indices of natural gas prices for various natural gas
    hubs. The complaint seeks statutory full consideration damages
    and attorneys fees and injunctive relief regulating
    defendants’ future conduct. The defendants include CMS
    Energy, CMS MST and CMS Field Services. On August 10, 2005,
    certain defendants, including CMS MST, filed a motion to dismiss
    and CMS Energy and CMS Field Services filed a motion to dismiss
    for lack of personal jurisdiction. Defendants attempted to
    remove the case to federal court, but it was remanded to state
    court by a federal judge. On February 2, 2007, the state
    court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint.
    Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on April 4, 2007. Oral
    arguments were heard on November 8, 2007.

J.P. Morgan Trust Company, in its capacity as Trustee of
    the FLI Liquidating Trust, filed an action in Kansas state court
    in August 2005 against a number of energy companies, including
    CMS Energy, CMS MST and CMS Field Services. The complaint
    alleges various claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act
    relating to reporting false natural gas trade information to
    publications that report trade information. Plaintiff is seeking
    statutory full consideration damages for its purchases of
    natural gas between January 1, 2000 and December 31,
    2001. The case was removed to the United States District Court
    for the District of Kansas on September 8, 2005 and
    transferred to the MDL proceeding on October 13, 2005. A
    motion to remand the case back to Kansas state court was denied
    on April 21, 2006. The court issued an order granting the
    motion to dismiss on December 18, 2006, but later reversed
    the ruling on reconsideration and has now denied the
    defendants’ motion to dismiss. On September 7, 2007,
    the CMS Energy defendants filed an answer to the complaint.

On November 20, 2005, CMS MST was served with a summons and
    complaint which named CMS Energy, CMS MST and CMS Field Services
    as defendants in a putative class action filed in Kansas state
    court, Learjet, Inc., et al. v. Oneok, Inc., et al. Similar
    to the other actions that have been filed, the complaint alleges
    that during the putative class period, January 1, 2000
    through October 31, 2002, defendants engaged in a scheme to
    violate the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act by knowingly reporting
    false or inaccurate information to the publications, thereby
    affecting the market price of natural gas. Plaintiffs, who
    allege they purchased natural gas from defendants and others for
    their facilities, are seeking statutory full consideration
    damages consisting of the full consideration paid by plaintiffs
    for natural gas. On December 7, 2005, the case was removed
    to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas
    and later that month a motion was filed to transfer the case to
    the MDL proceeding. On January 6, 2006, plaintiffs filed a
    motion to remand the case to Kansas state court. On
    January 23, 2006, a conditional transfer order transferring
    the case to the MDL proceeding was issued. On February 7,
    2006, plaintiffs filed an opposition to the conditional transfer
    order, and on June 20, 2006, the MDL Panel issued an order
    transferring the case to the MDL proceeding. The court issued an
    order dated August 3, 2006 denying the motion to remand the
    case to Kansas state court. Defendants filed a motion to
    dismiss, which was denied on July 27, 2007. On
    September 7, 2007, the CMS Energy defendants filed an
    answer to the complaint.

Breckenridge Brewery of Colorado, LLC and BBD Acquisition
    Co. v. Oneok, Inc., et al., a class action complaint
    brought on behalf of retail direct purchasers of natural gas in
    Colorado, was filed in Colorado state court in May 2006.
    Defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS Field Services, and CMS
    MST, are alleged to have violated the Colorado Antitrust Act of
    1992 in connection with their natural gas price reporting
    activities. Plaintiffs are seeking full refund damages. The case
    was removed to the United States District Court for the District
    of Colorado on June 12, 2006, a conditional transfer order
    transferring the case to the MDL proceeding was entered on
    June 27, 2006, and an order transferring the case to the
    MDL proceeding was entered on October 17, 2006. The court
    issued an order dated December 4, 2006 denying the motion
    to remand the case back to Colorado state court. Defendants have
    filed a motion to dismiss. On August 21, 2007, the court
    granted the motion to dismiss by CMS Energy on the basis of a
    lack of jurisdiction. The other defendants remain in the case,
    and they filed an answer to the complaint on


September 7, 2007. The remaining CMS Energy defendants also
    filed a summary judgment motion which remains pending.

On October 30, 2006, CMS Energy and CMS MST were each
    served with a summons and complaint which named CMS Energy, CMS
    MST and CMS Field Services as defendants in an action filed in
    Missouri state court, titled Missouri Public Service
    Commission v. Oneok, Inc. The Missouri Public Service
    Commission purportedly is acting as an assignee of six local
    distribution companies, and it alleges that from at least
    January 2000 through at least October 2002, defendants knowingly
    reported false natural gas prices to publications that compile
    and publish indices of natural gas prices, and engaged in wash
    sales. The complaint contains claims for violation of the
    Missouri Anti-Trust Law, fraud and unjust enrichment.
    Defendants removed the case to Missouri federal court and then
    transferred it to the Nevada MDL proceeding. On October 30,
    2007, the court granted the plaintiff’s motion to remand
    the case to state court in Missouri. The CMS Energy defendants
    will be filing an answer. A second action, Heartland Regional
    Medical Center, et al. v. Oneok Inc. et al., was filed in
    Missouri state court in March 2007 alleging violations of
    Missouri anti-trust laws. The second action is denoted as a
    class action. Defendants also removed this case to Missouri
    federal court, and it has been conditionally transferred to the
    Nevada MDL proceeding. Plaintiffs also filed a motion to remand
    this case back to state court but that motion has not yet been
    decided.

A class action complaint, Arandell Corp., et al v.
    XCEL Energy Inc., et al, was filed on or about December 15,
    2006 in Wisconsin state court on behalf of Wisconsin commercial
    entities that purchased natural gas between January 1, 2000
    and October 31, 2002. Defendants, including CMS Energy, CMS
    ERM and Cantera Gas Company, LLC, are alleged to have violated
    Wisconsin’s Anti-Trust statute by conspiring to manipulate
    natural gas prices. Plaintiffs are seeking full consideration
    damages, plus exemplary damages in an amount equal to three
    times the actual damages, and attorneys’ fees. The action
    was removed to Wisconsin federal district court and CMS Energy
    entered a special appearance for purpose of filing a motion to
    dismiss all the CMS Energy defendants due to lack of personal
    jurisdiction. That motion was filed on September 10, 2007.
    The court has not yet ruled on the motion. The court denied
    plaintiffs’ motion to remand the case back to Wisconsin
    state court, and the case has been transferred to the Nevada MDL
    proceeding.

CMS Energy and the other CMS Energy defendants will defend
    themselves vigorously against these matters but cannot predict
    their outcome.

ROUND-TRIP
    TRADING INVESTIGATIONS

From May 2000 through January 2002, CMS MST engaged in
    simultaneous, prearranged commodity trading transactions in
    which energy commodities were sold and repurchased at the same
    price. These transactions, referred to as round-trip trades, had
    no impact on previously reported consolidated net income, EPS or
    cash flows, but had the effect of increasing operating revenues
    and operating expenses by equal amounts.

CMS Energy is cooperating with an investigation by the DOJ
    concerning round-trip trading, which the DOJ commenced in May
    2002. CMS Energy is unable to predict the outcome of this matter
    and what effect, if any, this investigation will have on its
    business. In March 2004, the SEC approved a

cease-and-desist

order settling an administrative action against CMS Energy
    related to round-trip trading. The order did not assess a fine
    and CMS Energy neither admitted to nor denied the order’s
    findings. The settlement resolved the SEC investigation
    involving CMS Energy and CMS MST. Also in March 2004, the SEC
    filed an action against three former employees related to
    round-trip trading at CMS MST. One of the individuals has
    settled with the SEC. CMS Energy is currently advancing legal
    defense costs for the remaining two individuals in accordance
    with existing indemnification policies. The two individuals
    filed a motion to dismiss the SEC action, which was denied.

QUICKSILVER
    RESOURCES, INC.

On November 1, 2001, Quicksilver sued CMS MST in Texas
    State Court in Fort Worth, Texas for breach of contract in
    connection with a Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of natural
    gas, pursuant to which Quicksilver agreed to sell, and CMS MST
    agreed to buy, natural gas. Quicksilver contended that a special
    provision in the contract requires CMS MST to pay Quicksilver
    50 percent of the difference between $2.47/MMBtu and the
    index price each month. CMS MST disagrees with
    Quicksilver’s interpretation of the special provision and
    contends that it


has paid all monies owed for delivery of gas according to the
    contract. Quicksilver was seeking damages of approximately
    $126 million, plus prejudgment interest and attorneys’
    fees, which in CMS Energy’s judgment was unsupported by the
    facts.

The trial commenced on March 19, 2007. The jury verdict
    awarded Quicksilver zero compensatory damages but
    $10 million in punitive damages. The jury found that CMS
    MST breached the contract and committed fraud but found no
    actual damage related to such a claim.

On May 15, 2007, the trial court vacated the jury award of
    punitive damages but held that the contract should be rescinded
    prospectively. The judicial rescission of the contract caused
    CMS Energy to record a charge in the second quarter of 2007 of
    approximately $24 million, net of tax. To preserve its
    appellate rights, CMS MST filed a motion to modify, correct or
    reform the judgment and a motion for a judgment contrary to the
    jury verdict with the trial court. The trial court dismissed
    these motions. CMS MST has filed a notice of appeal with the
    Texas Court of Appeals. Quicksilver has filed a notice of cross
    appeal.

Consumers

In February 2008, Consumers received a data request relating to
    an investigation FERC is conducting into possible violations of
    the FERC’s posting and competitive bidding regulations for
    pre-arranged released firm capacity on natural gas pipelines.
    Consumers will cooperate with the FERC in responding to the
    request. Consumers cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

CMS Energy and
    Consumers

SECURITIES
    CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT

Beginning in May 2002, a number of complaints were filed against
    CMS Energy, Consumers and certain officers and directors of CMS
    Energy and its affiliates in the United States District Court
    for the Eastern District of Michigan. The cases were
    consolidated into a single lawsuit (the “Shareholder
    Action”), which generally sought unspecified damages based
    on allegations that the defendants violated United States
    securities laws and regulations by making allegedly false and
    misleading statements about CMS Energy’s business and
    financial condition, particularly with respect to revenues and
    expenses recorded in connection with round-trip trading by CMS
    MST. In January 2005, the court granted a motion to dismiss
    Consumers and three of the individual defendants, but denied the
    motions to dismiss CMS Energy and the 13 remaining individual
    defendants. In March 2006, the court conditionally certified a
    class consisting of “all persons who purchased CMS Common
    Stock during the period of October 25, 2000 through and
    including May 17, 2002 and who were damaged thereby.”
    The court excluded purchasers of CMS Energy’s
    8.75 percent Adjustable Convertible Trust Securities
    (“ACTS”) from the class and, in response, a new class
    action lawsuit was filed on behalf of ACTS purchasers (the
    “ACTS Action”) against the same defendants named in
    the Shareholder Action. The settlement described in the
    following paragraph has resolved both the Shareholder and ACTS
    actions.

On January 3, 2007, CMS Energy and other parties entered
    into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”),
    subject to court approval, regarding settlement of the two class
    action lawsuits. The settlement was approved by a special
    committee of independent directors and by the full Board of
    Directors of CMS Energy. Both judged that it was in the best
    interests of shareholders to eliminate this business
    uncertainty. Under the terms of the MOU, the litigation was
    settled for a total of $200 million, including the cost of
    administering the settlement and any attorney fees the court
    awards. CMS Energy made a payment of approximately
    $123 million plus interest on the settlement amount on
    September 20, 2007. CMS Energy’s insurers paid
    $77 million, the balance of the settlement amount. In
    entering into the MOU, CMS Energy made no admission of liability
    under the Shareholder Action and the ACTS Action. The parties
    executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement dated
    May 22, 2007 (“Stipulation”) incorporating the
    terms of the MOU. In accordance with the Stipulation, CMS Energy
    has paid approximately $1 million of the settlement amount
    to fund administrative expenses. On September 6, 2007, the
    court issued a final order approving the settlement. The
    remaining settlement amount was paid following the
    September 6, 2007 hearing.


On October 5, 2007, two former officers of Consumers filed
    an appeal of the order approving the settlement of the
    shareholder litigation. Their principal complaint was with the
    exclusion of all present and former officers and their immediate
    families from participation in the settlement. The two former
    officers have resolved their objections to the terms of the
    settlement order. On December 12, 2007, their appeal was
    dismissed by the court.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

CMS Energy and Consumers, as well as their subsidiaries and
    affiliates, are subject to various federal, state and local laws
    and regulations relating to the environment. Several of these
    companies have been named parties to various actions involving
    environmental issues. Based on their present knowledge and
    subject to future legal and factual developments, they believe
    it is unlikely that these actions, individually or in total,
    will have a material adverse effect on their financial condition
    or future results of operations. For additional information, see

    Discussion and Analysis

This MD&A is a consolidated report of CMS Energy. The terms
    “we” and “our” as used in this report refer
    to CMS Energy and its subsidiaries as a consolidated entity,
    except where it is clear that such term means only CMS Energy.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION

This

Form 10-K

and other written and oral statements that we make contain
    forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities
    Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our intention with the use of
    words such as “may,” “could,”
    “anticipates,” “believes,”
    “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,”
    “plans,” and other similar words is to identify
    forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. We
    designed this discussion of potential risks and uncertainties to
    highlight important factors that may impact our business and
    financial outlook. We have no obligation to update or revise
    forward-looking statements regardless of whether new
    information, future events, or any other factors affect the
    information contained in the statements. These forward-looking
    statements are subject to various factors that could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated
    in these statements. Such factors include our inability to
    predict or control:

•

the price of CMS Energy Common Stock, capital and financial
    market conditions, and the effect of such market conditions on
    the Pension Plan, interest rates, and access to the capital
    markets, including availability of financing to CMS Energy,
    Consumers, or any of their affiliates, and the energy industry,

•

market perception of the energy industry, CMS Energy, Consumers,
    or any of their affiliates,

•

factors affecting utility and diversified energy operations,
    such as unusual weather conditions, catastrophic weather-related

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

CMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan.
    We are the parent holding company of Consumers and Enterprises.
    Consumers is a combination electric and gas utility company
    serving in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Enterprises, through
    various subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged
    primarily in

CMS-4

domestic independent power production. We manage our businesses
    by the nature of services each provides and operate principally
    in three business segments: electric utility, gas utility, and
    enterprises.

We earn our revenue and generate cash from operations by
    providing electric and natural gas utility services, electric
    power generation, and gas distribution, transmission, and
    storage. Our businesses are affected primarily by:

•

weather, especially during the normal heating and cooling
    seasons,

•

economic conditions, primarily in Michigan,

•

regulation and regulatory issues that affect our electric and
    gas utility operations,

•

energy commodity prices,

•

interest rates, and

•

our debt credit rating.

During the past several years, our business strategy has
    emphasized improving our consolidated balance sheet and
    maintaining focus on our core strength: utility operations and
    service. Consistent with our commitment to our utility business,
    we invested $650 million in Consumers during 2007.

We completed the sale of our international Enterprises assets in
    2007, resulting in gross cash proceeds of $1.491 billion.
    We used the proceeds to retire debt and to invest in our utility
    business.

We also made important progress at Consumers to reduce business
    risk and to meet the future needs of our customers. We sold
    Palisades to Entergy in April 2007 for $380 million, and
    received $363 million after various closing adjustments.
    The sale improved our cash flow, reduced our nuclear operating
    and decommissioning risk, and increased our financial
    flexibility to support other utility investments.

In September 2007, we exercised the regulatory-out provision in
    the MCV PPA, thus limiting the amount we pay the MCV Partnership
    for capacity and fixed energy to the amount recoverable from our
    customers. The MCV Partnership may, under certain circumstances,
    have the right to terminate or reduce the amount of capacity
    sold under the MCV PPA, which could affect our need to build or
    purchase additional generating capacity. The MCV Partnership has
    notified us that it disputes our right to exercise the
    regulatory-out provision.

In May 2007, we filed with the MPSC our Balanced Energy
    Initiative, which is a comprehensive plan to meet customer
    energy needs over the next 20 years. The plan is designed
    to meet the growing customer demand for electricity with energy
    efficiency, demand management, expanded use of renewable energy,
    and development of new power plants to complement existing
    generating sources. In September 2007, we filed with the MPSC
    the second phase of our Balanced Energy Initiative, which
    contains our plan for construction of a new 800 MW clean
    coal plant at an existing site located near Bay City, Michigan.

In December 2007, we purchased a 935 MW natural gas-fired
    power plant located in Zeeland, Michigan from Broadway Gen
    Funding LLC, an affiliate of LS Power Group, for
    $519 million. This plant fits in with our Balanced Energy
    Initiative as it will help provide the capacity we need to meet
    the growing needs of our customers.

We took an important step in our business plan in 2007 by
    reinstating a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share on our
    common stock, after a four-year suspension. We paid
    $45 million in common stock dividends in 2007. In January
    2008, we increased the quarterly dividend on our common stock to
    $0.09 per share.

In September 2007, we also resolved a long-outstanding
    litigation issue by settling two class action lawsuits related
    to round-trip trading by CMS MST. We believe that eliminating
    this business uncertainty was in the best interests of our
    shareholders.

We also restructured our investment in DIG. In November 2007, we
    negotiated the termination of certain electricity sales
    agreements in order to eliminate future losses under those
    agreements. We recorded a liability and recognized a loss of
    $279 million in 2007, representing the cost to terminate
    the agreements. In February 2008, we closed the transaction and
    paid $275 million. Resolving the issues associated with the
    unfavorable supply contracts allows us to maximize future
    benefits from our DIG investment.

CMS-5

In the future, we will focus our strategy on:

•

continuing investment in our utility business,

•

growing earnings while controlling operating costs and parent
    debt, and

•

maintaining principles of safe, efficient operations, customer
    value, fair and timely regulation, and consistent financial
    performance.

As we execute our strategy, we will need to overcome a sluggish
    Michigan economy that has been hampered by negative developments
    in Michigan’s automotive industry and limited growth in the
    non-manufaturing sectors of the state’s economy. While the
    recent sub-prime mortgage market weakness has disrupted
    financial markets and the U.S. economy, it has not impacted
    materially our financial condition. We will continue to monitor
    developments for potential impacts on our business.

For 2007, our net loss was $227 million compared with a net
    loss of $90 million for 2006. The increase in net loss was
    due to the termination of contracts at CMS ERM. Further
    increasing the net loss were charges related to the exit from
    our international businesses, the absence of earnings from these
    businesses, and additional Bay Harbor environmental remediation
    expenses. The increase in losses was partially offset by
    increased earnings at our utility primarily due to the positive
    effects of rate orders and increased sales. Further reducing the
    year-over-year change were the absence of the shareholder
    settlement liability recorded in 2006 and the absence of
    activities related to our former interest in the MCV Partnership.

Total change

$

(137

)

For 2006, our net loss was $90 million compared with a net
    loss of $94 million for 2005. The improvement is primarily
    due to increased net income at our electric utility, as the
    positive effects of regulatory actions, the return of open
    access customers, and favorable tax adjustments more than offset
    the negative impacts of increased operating expenses and milder
    summer weather. The improvements at the electric utility were
    essentially negated by earnings reductions or increased losses
    at our other segments. At our Enterprises segment, the negative
    impacts of mark-to-market valuation losses and the net loss on
    the sale of our investment in the MCV Partnership more than
    offset the reduction in asset impairment charges. At our gas
    utility, net income decreased as the benefits derived from lower
    operating costs and a gas rate increase authorized by the MPSC
    in November 2006 were more than offset by lower, weather-driven
    sales. At our corporate interest and other segment, the cost of
    our agreement to settle the shareholder class action lawsuits
    more than offset reduced corporate expenditures.

CMS-7

Specific changes to net loss available to common stockholders
    for 2006 versus 2005 are:

In Millions

•

decrease in asset impairment charges as the $385 million
    impairment related to the MCV Partnership recorded in 2005

    recorded in 2006,

$


•

increase from Enterprises due to favorable arbitration and
    property tax awards,


•

increase in earnings from our electric utility primarily due to
    an increase in revenue from an electric rate order, the return
    to full service-rates of customers previously using alternative
    energy suppliers, and the expiration of rate caps in December
    2005 partially offset by higher operating expense and lower
    deliveries due to milder weather,


•

decrease in Enterprise and corporate interest and other expenses
    primarily due to an insurance reimbursement received for
    previously incurred legal expenses, and a reduction in debt
    retirement charges and other expenses,


•

lower incremental environmental remediation expenses recorded in
    2006 related to our involvement in Bay Harbor,

•

decrease in various corporate and Enterprises tax benefits as
    the absence of tax benefits recorded in 2005 related to the
    American Jobs Creation Act more than offset benefits recorded in
    2006, primarily related to the restoration and utilization of
    income tax credits due to the resolution of an IRS income tax
    audit,

(14

•

decrease in earnings from our gas utility primarily due to a

    by other gas revenue associated with pipeline capacity
    optimization and a reduction in operation and maintenance
    expenses, and

•

reduced earnings from discontinued operations as the positive
    impact of an arbitration award and a reduction of contingent
    liabilities recorded in 2005 exceeded income recorded in 2006

Electric deliveries:

For 2007, electric delivery
    revenues increased $18 million versus 2006, as deliveries
    to end-use customers were 38.8 billion kWh, an increase of
    0.3 billion kWh or 0.8 percent versus 2006. The
    increase in electric deliveries was primarily due to favorable
    weather, which resulted in an increase in electric delivery
    revenues of $14 million. The increase also reflects
    $2 million of additional revenue from the inclusion of the
    Zeeland power plant in rates and $2 million related to the
    return of additional former ROA customers.

For 2006, electric delivery revenues increased by
    $193 million over 2005 despite the fact that electric
    deliveries to end-use customers were 38.5 billion kWh, a
    decrease of 0.4 billion kWh or 1.2 percent versus
    2005. The decrease in deliveries was primarily due to milder
    summer weather compared with 2005, which resulted in a decrease
    in revenue of $16 million. However, despite these lower
    electric deliveries, electric delivery revenues increased
    $160 million due to an approved electric rate order in
    December 2005 and $49 million related to the return of
    additional former ROA customers.

Surcharge Revenue:

For 2007, the $6 million
    increase in surcharge revenue was primarily due to a surcharge
    that we started collecting in the first quarter of 2006 that the
    MPSC authorized under Section 10d(4) of the Customer Choice
    Act. The surcharge factors increased in January 2007 pursuant to
    an MPSC order. This surcharge increased electric delivery
    revenue by $13 million in 2007 versus 2006. Partially
    offsetting this increase was a decrease in the collection of
    Customer Choice Act transition costs, due to the expiration of
    the surcharge period for our large commercial and industrial
    customers. The absence of this surcharge decreased electric
    delivery revenue by $7 million in 2007 versus 2006.

In the first quarter of 2006, we started collecting the
    surcharge that the MPSC authorized under Section 10d(4) of
    the Customer Choice Act. This surcharge increased electric
    delivery revenue by $51 million in 2006 versus 2005. In
    addition, in the first quarter of 2006, we started collecting
    customer choice transition costs from our residential customers
    that increased electric delivery revenue by $12 million in
    2006 versus 2005. Reductions in other surcharges decreased
    electric delivery revenue by $2 million in 2006 versus 2005.

Palisades Revenue to PSCR:

Consistent with the MPSC
    order related to the April 2007 sale of Palisades,
    $136 million of revenue related to Palisades was designated
    toward recovery of PSCR costs.

Power Supply Costs and Related Revenue:

For 2007,
    PSCR revenue decreased by $17 million versus 2006. This
    decrease primarily reflects amounts excluded from recovery in
    the 2006 PSCR reconciliation case. The decrease also reflects
    the absence, in 2007, of an increase in Power Supply Revenue
    associated with the 2005 PSCR reconciliation case.

For 2006, PSCR revenue increased $57 million versus 2005.
    The increase was due to the absence, in 2006, of rate caps which
    allowed us to record power supply revenue to offset fully our
    power supply costs. Our ability to recover these power supply
    costs resulted in an $82 million increase in electric
    revenue in 2006 versus 2005. Additionally, electric revenue
    increased $9 million in 2006 versus 2005 primarily due to
    the return of former

CMS-9

special-contract customers to full-service rates in 2006.
    Partially offsetting these increases was the absence, in 2006,
    of deferrals of transmission and nitrogen oxides allowance
    expenditures related to our capped customers recorded in 2005.
    These costs were not fully recoverable due to the application of
    rate caps, so we deferred them for recovery under
    Section 10d(4) of the Customer Choice Act. In December
    2005, the MPSC approved the recovery of these costs. For 2005,
    deferrals of these costs were $34 million.

Other Operating Expenses, Other Income, and Non-Commodity
    Revenue:

For 2007, other operating expenses decreased
    $150 million, other income increased $21 million, and
    non-commodity revenue decreased $12 million versus 2006.

The decrease in other operating expenses was primarily due to
    lower operating and maintenance expense. Operating and
    maintenance expense decreased primarily due to the sale of
    Palisades in April 2007. Also contributing to the decrease was
    the absence, in 2007, of costs incurred in 2006 related to a
    planned refueling outage at Palisades, and lower overhead line
    maintenance and storm restoration costs. These decreases were
    partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization
    expense due to higher plant in service and greater amortization
    of certain regulatory assets.

Other income increased in 2007 versus 2006 primarily due to
    higher interest income on short-term cash investments. The
    increase in short-term cash investments was primarily due to
    proceeds from the Palisades sale. Non-commodity revenue
    decreased in 2007 versus 2006 primarily due to lower
    transmission services revenue.

For 2006, other operating expenses increased $236 million
    versus 2005. The increase in other operating expenses reflects
    higher operating and maintenance, customer service, depreciation
    and amortization, and pension and benefit expenses. Operating
    and maintenance expense increased primarily due to costs related
    to a planned refueling outage at Palisades, and higher tree
    trimming and storm restoration costs.

Regulatory Return on Capital Expenditures:

For 2007,
    the return on capital expenditures in excess of our depreciation
    base increased income by $5 million versus 2006. The
    increase reflects the equity return on the regulatory asset
    authorized by the MPSC’s December 2005 order which provided
    for the recovery of $333 million of Section 10d(4)
    costs over five years.

For 2006, the return on capital expenditures in excess of our
    depreciation base increased income by $22 million versus
    2005.

General Taxes:

For 2007, the $15 million
    increase in general taxes versus 2006 was primarily due to
    higher property tax expense, reflecting higher millage rates and
    lower property tax refunds versus 2006.

For 2006, the $7 million increase in general taxes versus
    2005 reflects higher MSBT expense, partially offset by property
    tax refunds.

Interest Charges:

For 2007, interest charges
    increased $18 million versus 2006. The increase was
    primarily due to interest on amounts to be refunded to customers
    as a result of the sale of Palisades as ordered by the MPSC.

For 2006, interest charges increased $34 million versus
    2005 primarily due to lower capitalized interest and interest
    expense related to an IRS income tax audit settlement. In 2005,
    we capitalized $33 million of interest in connection with
    the MPSC’s December 2005 order in our Section 10d(4)
    Regulatory Asset case. The IRS income tax settlement in 2006
    recognized that our taxable income for prior years was higher
    than originally filed, resulting in interest on the tax
    liability for these prior years.

Income Taxes:

For 2007, income taxes increased
    $5 million versus 2006 primarily due to the absence, in
    2007, of a $4 million income tax benefit from the
    restoration and utilization of income tax credits resulting from
    the resolution of an IRS income tax audit.

For 2006, income taxes increased $10 million versus 2005
    primarily due to higher earnings by the electric utility,
    partially offset by the resolution of an IRS income tax audit,
    which resulted in a $4 million income tax benefit caused by
    the restoration and utilization of income tax credits. Further
    reducing the increase in income taxes was $5 million of
    income tax benefits, primarily reflecting the tax treatment of
    items related to property, plant and equipment as required by
    past MPSC orders.

Gas Deliveries:

For 2007, gas delivery revenues
    increased by $10 million versus 2006 as gas deliveries,
    including miscellaneous transportation to end-use customers,
    were 300 bcf, an increase of 18 bcf or 6.4 percent. The
    increase in gas deliveries was primarily due to colder weather,
    partially offset by lower system efficiency.

In 2006, gas delivery revenues decreased by $61 million
    versus 2005 as gas deliveries, including miscellaneous
    transportation to end-use customers, were 282 bcf, a decrease of
    36 bcf or 11.3 percent. The decrease in gas deliveries was
    primarily due to warmer weather in 2006 versus 2005 and
    increased customer conservation efforts in response to higher
    gas prices.

Gas Rate Increase:

In November 2006, the MPSC issued
    an order authorizing an annual rate increase of
    $81 million. In August 2007, the MPSC issued an order
    authorizing an annual rate increase of $50 million. As a
    result of these orders, gas revenues increased $81 million
    for 2007 versus 2006.

In May 2006, the MPSC issued an interim gas rate order
    authorizing an $18 million annual rate increase. In
    November 2006, the MPSC issued an order authorizing an annual
    increase of $81 million. As a result of these orders, gas
    revenues increased $14 million for 2006 versus 2005.

Gas Wholesale and Retail Services, Other Gas Revenues, and
    Other Income:

For 2007, the $14 million increase
    in gas wholesale and retail services, other gas revenue and
    other income primarily reflects higher interest income on
    short-term cash investments. The increase in short-term cash
    investments was primarily due to proceeds from the Palisades
    sale.

For 2006, the $24 million increase in gas wholesale and
    retail services, other gas revenues, and other income primarily
    reflects higher pipeline revenues and higher pipeline capacity
    optimization in 2006 versus 2005.

Other Operating Expenses:

For 2007, other operating
    expenses increased $19 million versus 2006 primarily due to
    higher uncollectible accounts expense and payments, beginning in
    November 2006, to a fund that provides energy assistance to
    low-income customers.

For 2006, other operating expenses decreased $7 million
    versus 2005 primarily due to lower operating expenses, partially
    offset by higher customer service and pension and benefit
    expenses.

General Taxes and Depreciation:

For 2007, general
    taxes and depreciation increased $11 million versus 2006.
    The increase in general taxes reflects higher property tax
    expense due to higher millage rates and lower property tax
    refunds versus 2006. The increase in depreciation expense is
    primarily due to higher plant in service.

For 2006, general taxes and depreciation expense increased
    $10 million versus 2005. The increase in depreciation
    expense was primarily due to higher plant in service. The
    increase in general taxes reflects higher MSBT expense,
    partially offset by lower property tax expense.

Interest Charges:

For 2007, interest charges
    decreased $4 million reflecting lower average debt levels
    and a lower average interest rate versus 2006.

CMS-11

For 2006, interest charges increased $6 million primarily
    due to higher interest expense on our GCR overrecovery balance
    and an IRS income tax audit settlement. The settlement
    recognized that Consumers’ taxable income for prior years
    was higher than originally filed, resulting in interest on the
    tax liability for these prior years.

Income Taxes:

For 2007, income taxes increased
    $29 million versus 2006 primarily due to higher earnings by
    the gas utility.

For 2006, income taxes decreased $21 million versus 2005
    primarily due to lower earnings by the gas utility. Also
    contributing to the decrease was the absence, in 2006, of the
    write-off of general business credits of $2 million that
    expired in 2005, and the resolution, in 2006, of an IRS income
    tax audit, which resulted in a $3 million income tax
    benefit caused by the restoration and utilization of income tax
    credits. Further reducing the increase in income taxes was
    $5 million of income tax benefits, primarily reflecting the
    tax treatment of items related to property, plant and equipment
    as required by past MPSC orders.

Operating Revenues:

For 2007, operating revenues
    decreased $9 million versus 2006 primarily due to decreased
    third-party gas sales of $52 million, the write-off of
    $40 million of derivative assets associated with the
    Quicksilver contract that was voided by the trial judge in May
    2007, $18 million in mark-to-market losses related to the
    amendment of an electricity sales agreement, and the absence of
    third-party financial settlements of $16 million in 2007
    all at CMS ERM. Also contributing to the decrease in operating
    revenues was the absence of third-party tolling revenue of
    $17 million at DIG in 2007. These decreases were partially
    offset by an increase in mark-to-market gains of
    $89 million on power and gas contracts versus 2006 and
    increased power sales of $45 million at CMS ERM.

For 2006, operating revenues decreased $253 million versus
    2005 primarily due to lower revenue of $102 million at CMS
    ERM related to mark-to-market losses on power and gas contracts,
    compared with gains on such items in 2005. In addition, CMS ERM
    had lower third-party power sales of $53 million, decreased
    sales to MISO of $22 million, and decreased financial
    revenue of $76 million resulting from the termination of
    prepaid gas contracts.

CMS-12

Cost of Gas and Purchased Power:

For 2007, cost of
    gas and purchased power decreased $36 million versus 2006.
    The decrease was primarily due to lower power purchases from
    MISO of $26 million at CMS ERM and a decrease in the cost
    of gas sold of $10 million due to lower gas prices.

For 2006, cost of gas and purchased power decreased by
    $128 million versus 2005. The decrease was primarily due to
    decreases in the cost of gas sold of $93 million resulting
    from lower gas prices partially offset by increased usage, and
    decreases in third-party wholesale purchased power of
    $61 million resulting from the implementation of the MISO
    market all at CMS ERM, and a decrease in transmission costs of
    $3 million at DIG. These decreases were partially offset by
    power purchases from MISO of $29 million at CMS ERM.

Earnings from Equity Method Investees:

For 2007,
    equity earnings decreased $48 million versus 2006. The
    decrease was due to the absence of $61 million of earnings
    associated with our investments in Africa, the Middle East and
    India that were sold in May 2007 and $6 million of earnings
    associated with our investments in Argentina and Chile that were
    sold in March and August 2007. Also contributing to the decrease
    was a $5 million reduction in earnings from our former
    investment in GasAtacama due to the shortage of gas from
    Argentina. These decreases were partially offset by the absence,
    in 2007, of a $20 million provision for higher foreign
    taxes in Argentina and an increase of $4 million in
    earnings from our remaining assets in Argentina.

For 2006, equity earnings decreased $37 million versus
    2005. The decrease was primarily due to the establishment of tax
    reserves totaling $23 million related to foreign
    investments, higher tax expense primarily at Jorf Lasfar of
    $5 million due to lower tax relief and lower earnings at
    Shuweihat of $1 million due to higher operating and
    maintenance costs.

Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets, Net:

For 2007, the
    net gain on asset sales was $21 million. The net gain
    consisted of a $34 million gain on the sale of our equity
    investment in El Chocon to Endesa S.A., and $5 million in
    gains on the sale of other assets, partially offset by a
    $13 million net loss on the sale of our equity investments
    in Africa, the Middle East and India to TAQA and a
    $5 million net loss on the sale of our Argentine and
    Michigan assets to Lucid Energy.

For 2006, there were no gains or losses on asset sales. In 2005,
    we had gains on the sale of GVK and SLAP totaling
    $6 million.

For a discussion of the 2006 sale of our interest in the MCV
    Partnership, see “The MCV Partnership” in this
    section. For additional information, see Note 2, Asset
    Sales, Discontinued Operations and Impairment Charges.

Operation and Maintenance:

For 2007, operation and
    maintenance expenses increased $7 million versus 2006 due
    to the absence of a favorable 2006 arbitration settlement
    related to DIG of $20 million and increased maintenance
    expense of $2 million, partially offset by the reduction of
    $6 million in expenses associated with assets sold during
    2007, the reimbursement of $3 million in arbitration costs
    at CMS Gas Transmission in 2007 and the absence of
    $6 million in losses on the termination of prepaid gas
    contracts in 2006.

For 2006, operation and maintenance expenses decreased
    $19 million versus 2005 due to a favorable arbitration
    settlement related to DIG of $20 million and a
    $3 million reduction in losses on the termination of
    prepaid gas contracts. These decreases were partially offset by
    increased expenditures related to prospecting initiatives in
    North America of $4 million.

Electric Sales Contract Termination:

For 2007, CMS
    ERM recorded a charge of $279 million related to the
    termination of electricity sales agreements. For additional
    information, see the Enterprises Outlook section included in
    this MD&A.

General Taxes, Depreciation, and Other Income,
    Net:

For 2007, the net of general tax expense,
    depreciation and other income contributed to a $20 million
    increase in operating income versus 2006. Other income increased
    due to gains of $8 million recognized on the rebalancing of
    SERP investments and the absence, in 2007, of $4 million of
    accretion expense related to prepaid gas contracts at CMS ERM
    recorded in 2006, and general tax expense and depreciation
    decreased $8 million due to the sale of assets in 2007.

For 2006, the net of general tax expense, depreciation, and
    other income contributed to a $7 million increase in
    operating income versus 2005. Other income increased due to a
    decrease in accretion expense of $13 million related

CMS-13

to the prepaid gas contracts at CMS ERM, partially offset by an
    increase of $4 million in general tax expense and
    depreciation and the absence, in 2006, of a $2 million
    favorable settlement recorded at CMS Gas Transmission in 2005.

Asset Impairment Charges, Net of Insurance
    Reimbursement:

For 2007, asset impairment charges
    decreased $29 million versus 2006. For 2007, we recorded
    net impairment charges of $187 million that included
    $262 million for the reduction in fair value of our
    investments in TGN, Jamaica, GasAtacama and PowerSmith, and a
    $75 million credit to recognize a prior insurance award
    associated with our ownership interest in TGN. For 2006, we
    recorded a $214 million charge for the reduction in the
    fair value of our former equity investment in GasAtacama and
    related notes receivable and other impairment charges of
    $2 million at Enterprises. For additional information, see
    Note 2, Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations and Impairment
    Charges.

For 2006, asset impairment charges increased $216 million
    versus 2005 primarily due to 2006 charges of $214 million
    recorded for the impairment of our former equity investment in
    GasAtacama and related notes receivable, and $2 million of
    other impairment charges.

For a discussion of asset impairment charges related to our
    former interest in the MCV Partnership, see “The MCV
    Partnership” in this section.

Environmental Remediation:

Our environmental
    remediation charges relate to our projections of future costs
    associated with Bay Harbor. These charges were $44 million
    in 2007, $9 million in 2006, and $40 million in 2005.
    Total remediation charges including accretion expense were
    $140 million. For additional information, see Note 3,
    Contingencies.

Fixed Charges:

For 2007, fixed charges decreased
    $14 million versus 2006 due to lower interest expense on
    subsidiary debt of $12 million resulting from asset sales
    in 2007. Also contributing to the decrease was the absence, in
    2007, of $2 million of interest expense at DIG related to
    an arbitration settlement recorded in 2006.

For 2006, fixed charges increased $9 million versus 2005
    due to higher interest expense of $7 million resulting from
    an increase in subsidiary debt and $2 million in higher
    interest expense at DIG related to an arbitration settlement.

Minority Interest:

The allocation of profits to
    minority owners decreases our net income, and the allocation of
    losses to minority owners increases our net income. For 2007,
    minority owners shared in a portion of increased earnings at our
    subsidiaries versus 2006. This was primarily due to increased
    earnings and gains due to asset sales.

For 2006, minority owners shared in a portion of increased
    earnings at our subsidiaries versus 2005. This was primarily due
    to increased earnings, partially offset by losses from asset
    impairments.

Income Taxes:

For 2007, income tax expense decreased
    $41 million versus 2006. The decrease reflects
    $93 million in lower tax expenses resulting from higher net
    losses in 2007 versus 2006 and $27 million of tax benefits
    primarily related to lower tax reserves in 2007. These benefits
    were partially offset by $79 million of tax expense on
    earnings associated with the recognition of previously deferred
    foreign earnings of subsidiaries.

For 2006, income tax expense decreased $103 million versus
    2005. The decrease reflects $119 million in lower tax
    expenses resulting from higher net losses in 2006 versus 2005
    and $23 million of tax benefit related to higher deferred
    foreign earnings of subsidiaries and resolution of an IRS income
    tax audit of $8 million, primarily for the restoration and
    utilization of income tax credits. These benefits were partially
    offset by the absence of $30 million of income tax benefit
    related to the American Jobs Creation Act recorded in 2005 and
    $17 million of tax expense primarily related to higher tax
    reserves in 2006.

The MCV Partnership:

We sold our ownership interests
    in the MCV Partnership in November 2006. As a result, we have
    condensed its consolidated results of operations for the years
    2005, 2006 and 2007 for discussion purposes.

In 2006, our share of the MCV Partnership’s loss was
    $60 million, net of tax and minority interest. This was
    primarily due to mark-to-market losses and the net impact of the
    sale transaction, including asset impairment charges. These
    losses were partially offset by operating income and a property
    tax refund received in 2006. For additional information, see
    Note 2, Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations and Impairment
    Charges.

CMS-14

For 2006 versus 2005, our share of the MCV Partnership’s
    earnings increased by $225 million, net of tax, primarily
    due to the absence of a 2005 impairment charge to property,
    plant and equipment at the MCV Partnership. This increase was
    partially offset by the recognition of mark-to-market losses in
    2006 versus mark-to-market gains in 2005.

For 2007, corporate interest and other net expenses were
    $30 million, a decrease of $123 million versus 2006.
    The $123 million decrease primarily reflects the absence,
    in 2007, of a charge for the settlement of our shareholder class
    action lawsuits partially offset by the absence of an insurance
    reimbursement received in June 2006. Also contributing to the
    decrease was the reduction of tax expense in 2007 related to the
    sale of our international operations. Partially offsetting the
    decrease is the absence, in 2007, of a tax benefit due to the
    resolution of an IRS income tax audit.

For 2006, corporate interest and other net expenses were
    $153 million, an increase of $18 million versus 2005.
    The increase reflects an $80 million after tax net charge
    recorded in 2006 as a result of our agreement to settle
    shareholder class action lawsuits. Also contributing to the
    increase was the recognition of a portion of the reduction in
    fair value in our investment in GasAtacama. Partially offsetting
    the increase was the 2006 resolution of an IRS income tax audit,
    which resulted in an income tax benefit primarily for the
    restoration and utilization of income tax credits. Further
    offsetting the increase were lower early debt retirement
    premiums, and the receipt of insurance proceeds for previously
    incurred legal expenses.

Discontinued Operations:

For 2007, the net loss from
    discontinued operations was $89 million versus
    $54 million of net income in 2006. The $143 million
    change is primarily due to the net loss on the disposal of
    international businesses in 2007, which replaced earnings
    recorded for these businesses in 2006.

For 2006, we recorded $54 million in net income versus
    $57 million in net income in 2005. The $3 million
    reduction in net income is primarily due to the absence of
    income from the favorable resolution of certain accrued
    contingent liabilities in 2006 associated with previously
    disposed businesses.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following accounting policies and related information are
    important to an understanding of our results of operations and
    financial condition and should be considered an integral part of
    our MD&A. For additional accounting policies, see
    Note 1, Corporate Structure and Accounting Policies.

Use
    of Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we use
    estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and
    disclosures. We use accounting estimates for asset valuations,
    depreciation, amortization, financial and derivative
    instruments, employee benefits, indemnifications and
    contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimated results
    due to changes in the regulatory environment, competition,
    foreign exchange, regulatory decisions, lawsuits, and other
    factors.

Contingencies:

We record a liability for
    contingencies when we conclude that it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors in making
    these assessments.

Income Taxes:

The amount of income taxes we pay is
    subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and foreign tax
    authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. Our
    estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is
    highly judgmental. We believe we have provided adequately for
    these exposures; however, our future results may include
    favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax
    liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved
    or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire.
    Additionally, our judgment as to

CMS-15

our ability to recover our deferred tax assets may change. We
    believe our valuation allowances related to our deferred tax
    assets are adequate, but future results may include favorable or
    unfavorable adjustments. As a result, our effective tax rate may
    fluctuate significantly over time. On January 1, 2007, we
    adopted FIN 48, the FASB’s interpretation on the
    recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. For
    additional details, see the “Implementation of New
    Accounting Standards” section included in this MD&A.

Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments:

Our
    assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets and equity
    method investments involves critical accounting estimates. We
    periodically perform tests of impairment if certain triggering
    events occur or if there has been a decline in value that may be
    other than temporary. Of our total assets, recorded at
    $14.196 billion at December 31, 2007, 62 percent
    represent long-lived assets and equity method investments that
    are subject to this type of analysis. We base our evaluations of
    impairment on such indicators as:

•

the nature of the assets,

•

projected future economic benefits,

•

regulatory and political environments,

•

historical and future cash flow and profitability
    measurements, and

•

other external market conditions and factors.

The estimates we use can change over time, which could have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For
    additional details, see Note 1, Corporate Structure and
    Accounting Policies — “Impairment of Long-Lived
    Assets and Equity Method Investments.”

Discontinued
    Operations

We determined that certain consolidated subsidiaries met the
    criteria of assets held for sale under SFAS No. 144.
    At December 31, 2006, these subsidiaries included certain
    Argentine businesses, a majority of our Michigan non-utility
    businesses, CMS Energy Brasil S.A., Takoradi, SENECA, and
    certain associated holding companies. There were no assets
    classified as held for sale at December 31, 2007. For
    additional details, see Note 2, Asset Sales, Discontinued
    Operations and Impairment Charges.

Accounting
    for the Effects of Industry Regulation

Our involvement in a regulated industry requires us to use
    SFAS No. 71 to account for the effects of the
    regulators’ decisions that impact the timing and
    recognition of our revenues and expenses. As a result, we may
    defer or recognize revenues and expenses differently than a
    non-regulated entity.

For example, we may record as regulatory assets items that a
    non-regulated entity normally would expense if the actions of
    the regulator indicate such expenses will be recovered in future
    rates. Conversely, we may record as regulatory liabilities items
    that non-regulated entities may normally recognize as revenues
    if the actions of the regulator indicate they will require that
    such revenues be refunded to customers. Judgment is required to
    determine the recoverability of items recorded as regulatory
    assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2007, we had
    $2.059 billion recorded as regulatory assets and
    $2.137 billion recorded as regulatory liabilities.

Our PSCR and GCR cost recovery mechanisms also give rise to
    probable future revenues that will be recovered from customers
    or past overrecoveries that will be refunded to customers
    through the ratemaking process. Underrecoveries are included in
    Accrued power supply and gas revenue and overrecoveries are
    included in Accrued rate refunds on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. At December 31, 2007, we had $45 million
    recorded as regulatory assets for underrecoveries of power
    supply costs and $19 million recorded as regulatory
    liabilities for overrecoveries of gas costs.

For additional details, see Note 1, Corporate Structure and
    Accounting Policies - “Utility Regulation.”

CMS-16

Financial
    and Derivative Instruments, Trading Activities, and Market Risk
    Information

Financial Instruments:

Debt and equity securities
    classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value
    determined from quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and
    losses resulting from changes in fair value of
    available-for-sale debt and equity securities are reported, net
    of tax, in equity as part of AOCL. Unrealized losses are
    excluded from earnings unless the related changes in fair value
    are determined to be other than temporary.

Derivative Instruments:

We use the criteria in
    SFAS No. 133 to determine if we need to account for
    certain contracts as derivative instruments. These criteria are
    complex and often require significant judgment in applying them
    to specific contracts. If a contract is a derivative and does
    not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception under
    SFAS No. 133, it is recorded on our consolidated
    balance sheet at its fair value. Each quarter, we adjust the
    resulting asset or liability to reflect any change in the fair
    value of the contract, a practice known as marking the contract
    to market. For additional details on our derivatives, see
    Note 6, Financial and Derivative Instruments.

To determine the fair value of our derivatives, we use
    information from external sources, such as quoted market prices
    and other valuation information. For certain contracts, this
    information is not available and we use mathematical models to
    value our derivatives. These models use various inputs and
    assumptions, including commodity market prices and volatilities,
    as well as interest rates and contract maturity dates. The fair
    values we calculate for our derivatives may change significantly
    as commodity prices and volatilities change. The cash returns we
    actually realize on our derivatives may be different from the
    results that we estimate using models. If necessary, our
    calculations of fair value include reserves to reflect the
    credit risk of our counterparties.

The types of contracts we typically classify as derivatives are
    interest rate swaps, forward contracts for electricity and gas,
    option contracts for electricity and gas, gas futures, and
    electric swaps. Most of our commodity purchase and sale
    contracts are not subject to derivative accounting under
    SFAS No. 133 because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units
    specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity
    or bcf of natural gas),

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales
    exception, or

•

there is not an active market for the commodity.

Our coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is
    not an active market for the coal we purchase. If an active
    market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts
    may qualify as derivatives. For Consumers, which is subject to
    regulatory accounting, the resulting mark-to-market gains and
    losses would be offset by changes in regulatory assets and
    liabilities and would not affect net income. For other CMS
    Energy subsidiaries, the resulting mark-to-market impact on
    earnings could be material.

Derivative Contracts Associated with Equity
    Investments

: In May 2007, we sold our ownership
    interest in businesses in the Middle East, Africa, and India.
    Certain of these businesses held interest rate contracts and
    foreign exchange contracts that were derivatives. Before the
    sale, we recorded our share of the change in fair value of these
    contracts in AOCL if the contracts qualified for cash flow hedge
    accounting; otherwise, we recorded our share in Earnings from
    Equity Method Investees.

At the date of the sale, we had accumulated a net loss of
    $13 million, net of tax, in AOCL representing our share of
    mark-to-market gains and losses from cash flow hedges held by
    the equity method investees. After the sale, we reclassified
    this amount and recognized it in earnings as a reduction of the

CMS ERM Contracts:

In order to support CMS
    Energy’s ongoing operations, CMS ERM enters into contracts
    to purchase and sell electricity and natural gas in the future.
    These forward contracts will result in physical delivery of the
    commodity at a contracted price. These contracts are generally
    long-term in nature and are classified as non-trading contracts.

To manage commodity price risks associated with these forward
    purchase and sale contracts, CMS ERM uses various financial
    instruments, such as swaps, options, and futures. CMS ERM also
    uses these types of instruments

CMS-17

to manage commodity price risks associated with generation
    assets owned by CMS Energy and its subsidiaries. These financial
    contracts are classified as trading contracts.

Certain of CMS ERM’s non-trading and trading contracts
    qualify as derivatives. We include the fair value of these
    derivatives in either Price risk management assets or Price risk
    management liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
    following tables provide a summary of these contracts at

Market Risk Information:

We are exposed to market
    risks including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates,
    commodity prices, and equity security prices. We may use various
    contracts to limit our exposure to these

CMS-18

risks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts.
    We enter into these risk management contracts using established
    policies and procedures, under the direction of two different
    committees: an executive oversight committee consisting of
    senior management representatives and a risk committee
    consisting of business unit managers.

These contracts contain credit risk, which is the risk that our
    counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations.
    We reduce this risk through established credit policies, such as
    evaluating our counterparties’ credit quality and setting
    collateral requirements as necessary. If terms permit, we use
    standard agreements that allow us to net positive and negative
    exposures associated with the same counterparty. Given these
    policies, our current exposures, and our credit reserves, we do
    not expect a material adverse effect on our financial position
    or future earnings because of counterparty nonperformance.

The following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss
    in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from our financial
    instruments, including our derivative contracts, assuming a
    hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices of
    10 percent. Potential losses could exceed the amounts shown
    in the sensitivity analyses if changes in market rates or prices
    exceed 10 percent.

Interest Rate Risk:

We are exposed to interest rate
    risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate and variable-rate
    financing instruments, and from interest rate swap agreements.
    We use a combination of these instruments to manage this risk as
    deemed appropriate, based upon market conditions. These
    strategies are designed to provide and maintain a balance
    between risk and the lowest cost of capital.

(a)

Fair value reduction could only be realized if we transferred
    all of our fixed-rate financing to other creditors.

At December 31, 2007, Consumers had $131 million in
    variable auction rate tax exempt bonds, insured by monoline
    insurers, that are subject to rate reset every 35 days. The
    subprime mortgage problems have put monoline insurers’
    credit ratings at risk of downgrade by rating agencies. This
    risk of downgrade could cause the interest rates on these bonds
    to rise. Consumers does not expect its interest rate risk
    exposure regarding these bonds to be material. Consumers is
    continuing to monitor the situation and its alternatives.

Commodity Price Risk:

Operating in the energy
    industry, we are exposed to commodity price risk, which arises
    from fluctuations in the price of electricity, natural gas,
    coal, and other commodities. Commodity prices are influenced by
    a number of factors, including weather, changes in supply and
    demand, and liquidity of commodity markets. In order to manage
    commodity price risk, we enter into non-trading derivative
    contracts, such as forward purchase and sale contracts for
    electricity and natural gas. We also enter into trading
    derivative contracts, including options and swaps for
    electricity and gas. For additional details on these contracts,
    see Note 6, Financial and Derivative Instruments.

Pension
    and OPEB

Pension:

We have external trust funds to provide
    retirement pension benefits to our employees under a
    non-contributory, defined benefit Pension Plan. On
    September 1, 2005, the defined benefit Pension Plan was
    closed to new participants and we implemented the qualified
    DCCP, which provides an employer contribution of 5 percent
    of base pay to the existing Employees’ Savings Plan. An
    employee contribution is not required to receive the plan’s
    employer cash contribution. All employees hired on or after
    September 1, 2005 participate in this plan as part of their
    retirement benefit program. Previous cash balance pension plan
    participants also participate in the DCCP as of
    September 1, 2005. Additional pay credits under the cash
    balance pension plan were discontinued as of that date.

401(k):

We resumed the employer’s match in CMS
    Energy Common Stock in our 401(k) savings plan on
    January 1, 2005. On September 1, 2005, we increased
    the employer match from 50 percent to 60 percent on
    eligible contributions up to the first six percent of an
    employee’s wages.

Beginning May 1, 2007, the CMS Energy Common Stock Fund was
    no longer an investment option available for investments in the
    401(k) savings plan and the employer match was no longer in CMS
    Energy Common Stock. Participants had an opportunity to
    reallocate investments in the CMS Energy Common Stock Fund to
    other plan investment alternatives prior to November 1,
    2007. In November 2007, the remaining shares in the CMS Energy
    Common Stock Fund were sold and the sale proceeds were
    reallocated to other plan investment options.

OPEB:

We provide postretirement health and life
    benefits under our OPEB plan to qualifying retired employees.

In accordance with SFAS No. 158, we record liabilities
    for pension and OPEB on our consolidated balance sheet at the
    present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets.
    We use SFAS No. 87 to account for pension expense and SFAS
    No. 106 to account for other postretirement benefit
    expense. The calculation of the liabilities and associated
    expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and requires many
    assumptions, including:

•

life expectancies,

•

present-value discount rates,

•

expected long-term rate of return on plan assets,

•

rate of compensation increases, and

•

anticipated health care costs.

A change in these assumptions could change significantly our
    recorded liabilities and associated expenses.

The following table provides an estimate of our pension cost,
    OPEB cost, and cash contributions for the next three years:

Actual future pension cost and contributions will depend on
    future investment performance, changes in future discount rates
    and various other factors related to the populations
    participating in the Pension Plan.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the Pension
    Plan assets by 0.25 percent (from 8.25 percent to
    8.00 percent) would increase estimated pension cost for
    2008 by $3 million. Lowering the discount rate by
    0.25 percent (from 6.40 percent to 6.15 percent)
    would increase estimated pension cost for 2008 by
    $1 million.

For additional details on postretirement benefits, see
    Note 7, Retirement Benefits.

Accounting
    for Asset Retirement Obligations

We are required to record the fair value of the cost to remove
    assets at the end of their useful lives, if there is a legal
    obligation to remove them. We have legal obligations to remove
    some of our assets at the end of their useful lives. We
    calculate the fair value of ARO liabilities using an expected
    present value technique that reflects assumptions about costs,
    inflation, and profit margin that third parties would consider
    to assume the obligation. No market risk premium was included in
    our ARO fair value estimate since a reasonable estimate could
    not be made.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the
    period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with
    indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Generally, our
    gas transmission and electric and gas distribution assets have
    indeterminate lives and retirement cash flows that cannot be
    determined. However, we have recorded an ARO for our obligation
    to cut, purge, and cap abandoned gas distribution mains and gas
    services at the end of their useful lives. We have not recorded
    a liability for assets that have insignificant cumulative
    disposal costs, such as substation batteries. For additional
    details, see Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations.

Capital
    Resources and Liquidity

Factors affecting our liquidity and capital requirements include:

•

results of operations,

•

capital expenditures,

•

energy commodity and transportation costs,

•

contractual obligations,

•

regulatory decisions,

•

debt maturities,

•

credit ratings,

•

working capital needs, and

•

collateral requirements.

During the summer months, we buy natural gas and store it for
    resale during the winter heating season. Although our prudent
    natural gas costs are recoverable from our customers, the
    storage of natural gas as inventory requires additional
    liquidity due to the lag in cost recovery.

Our cash management plan includes controlling operating expenses
    and capital expenditures and evaluation of market conditions for
    financing opportunities, if needed.

CMS-21

We believe the following items will be sufficient to meet our
    liquidity needs:

•

our current level of cash and revolving credit facilities,

•

our anticipated cash flows from operating and investing
    activities, and

•

our ability to access secured and unsecured borrowing capacity
    in the capital markets, if necessary.

In the second quarter of 2007, Moody’s and S&P
    upgraded the long-term credit ratings of CMS Energy and
    Consumers and revised the rating outlook to stable from positive.

Cash
    Position, Investing, and Financing

Our operating, investing, and financing activities meet
    consolidated cash needs. At December 31, 2007, we had
    $382 million of consolidated cash, which includes
    $34 million of restricted cash and $7 million from
    entities consolidated pursuant to FIN 46(R).

Our primary ongoing source of cash is dividends and other
    distributions from our subsidiaries. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, Consumers paid $251 million in
    common stock dividends to CMS Energy. For details on dividend
    restrictions, see Note 4, Financings and Capitalization.

Our cash flow statements include amounts related to discontinued
    operations through the date of disposal. The sale of our
    discontinued operations and their related cash flows will have
    no material adverse effect on our liquidity, as we used the
    proceeds of these sales to invest in our utility business and to
    reduce debt. For additional details on discontinued operations,
    see Note 2, Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations and
    Impairment Charges.

Operating
    Activities:

2007:

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $27 million, a decrease of $659 million versus 2006.
    In addition to a decrease in earnings, cash provided by
    operating activities decreased primarily as result of the
    following:

•

absence, in 2007, of the sale of accounts receivable,

•

payments made to fund our Pension Plan and to settle a
    shareholder class action lawsuit,

•

refunds to customers of excess Palisades decommissioning
    funds, and

•

reduced cash distributions from international investments sold
    during 2007 and other timing differences.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

a decrease in expenditures for gas inventory, as the milder
    winter in 2006 allowed us to accumulate more gas in our storage
    facilities, and

•

the absence of the release of the MCV Partnership gas supplier
    funds on deposit due to the sale of our interest in the MCV
    Partnership in 2006.

CMS-22

For additional details on excess Palisades decommissioning
    funds, see Note 2, Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations and
    Impairment Charges.


: Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $686 million, an increase of $88 million versus 2005.
    Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily as
    result of the following:

•

decreases in accounts receivable primarily due to the collection
    of receivables in 2006 reflecting higher gas prices billed
    during the latter part of 2005 and reduced billings in the
    latter part of 2006 due to milder weather,

•

reduced inventory purchases,

•

cash proceeds from the sale of excess sulfur dioxide
    allowances, and

•

a return of funds formerly held as collateral under certain gas
    hedging arrangements.

These increases were partially offset by decreases in the MCV
    Partnership gas supplier funds on deposit as a result of refunds
    to suppliers from decreased exposure due to declining gas prices
    in 2006.

Investing
    Activities:

2007:

Net cash provided by investing activities was
    $658 million, an increase of $1.407 billion versus
    2006. This increase was primarily due to proceeds from asset
    sales and the related dissolution of our nuclear decommissioning
    trust funds. These changes were partially offset by an increase
    in capital expenditures primarily due to the purchase of the
    Zeeland power plant.

2006:

Net cash used in investing activities was
    $749 million, an increase of $256 million versus 2005.
    This was primarily due to cash relinquished from the sale of
    assets, the absence of short-term investment proceeds, an
    increase in capital expenditures and cost to retire property,
    and an increase in non-current notes receivable. This activity
    was offset by the release of restricted cash in February 2006,
    which we used to extinguish long-term debt - related parties.

For additional details on asset sales, see Note 2, Asset
    Sales, Discontinued Operations and Impairment Charges.

Financing
    Activities:

2007:

Net cash used in financing activities was
    $690 million, an increase of $256 million versus 2006.
    This was primarily due to an increase in net debt retirements
    and the payment of common stock dividends.

2006:

Net cash used in financing activities was
    $434 million, an increase of $508 million versus 2005.
    This was due to an increase in net retirement of long-term debt
    of $269 million combined with a decrease in proceeds from
    common stock issuances of $287 million.

For additional details on long-term debt activity, see
    Note 4, Financings and Capitalization.

    availability or deliverability. These payments will approximate
    $58 million per month during 2008. If a plant is not
    available to deliver electricity, we will not be obligated to
    make these payments for that period. For additional details on
    power supply costs, see “Electric Utility Results of

Revolving Credit Facilities:

For details on our
    revolving credit facilities, see Note 4, Financings and
    Capitalization.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

CMS Energy and
    certain of its subsidiaries enter into various arrangements in
    the normal course of business to facilitate commercial
    transactions with third parties. These arrangements include
    indemnifications, surety bonds, letters of credit, and financial
    and performance guarantees. Indemnifications are usually
    agreements to reimburse a counterparty that may incur losses due
    to outside claims or breach of contract terms. The maximum
    amount of potential payments we would be required to make under
    a

CMS-24

number of these indemnities is not estimable. At
    December 31, 2007, we have an $88 million liability in
    connection with indemnities related to the sale of certain
    subsidiaries reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We provide guarantees and surety bonds on behalf of certain
    non-consolidated entities, improving their ability to transact
    business. In addition, we have provided financial guarantees to
    certain property owners in connection with the Bay Harbor
    remediation effort. We monitor these obligations and believe it
    is unlikely that we will incur any material losses associated
    with these guarantees. For additional details on these and other
    guarantee arrangements, see Note 3, Contingencies,
    “Other Contingencies — Guarantees and
    Indemnifications

.”

Sale of Accounts Receivable:

Under a revolving
    accounts receivable sales program, Consumers may sell up to
    $325 million of certain accounts receivable. This program
    provides less expensive funding that unsecured debt. For
    additional details, see Note 4, Financings and
    Capitalization.

Capital Expenditures:

For planning purposes, we
    forecast capital expenditures over a three-year period. We
    review these estimates and may revise them, periodically, due to
    a number of factors including environmental regulations,
    business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and
    the ability to access capital. The following is a summary of our

OUTLOOK

Corporate
    Outlook

Our business strategy will focus on making continued investment
    in our utility business, further reducing parent debt, and
    growing earnings while controlling operating costs.

Our primary focus with respect to our utility business will be
    to continue to invest in our utility system to enable us to meet
    our customer commitments, to comply with increasing
    environmental performance standards, and to maintain adequate
    supply and capacity. Our primary focus with respect to our
    non-utility businesses will be to optimize cash flow and to
    maximize the value of our remaining assets.

ELECTRIC UTILITY
    BUSINESS OUTLOOK

Growth:

In 2007, electric deliveries grew about one
    percent over 2006 levels. In 2008, we project electric
    deliveries to decline one-quarter of a percent compared to 2007
    levels. This outlook assumes a small decline in industrial
    economic activity, the cancellation of one wholesale customer
    contract, and normal weather conditions throughout the year.

We expect electric deliveries to grow one percent annually over
    the next five years. This outlook assumes a modestly growing
    customer base and a stabilizing Michigan economy after 2008.
    This growth rate, which reflects a long-range expected trend
    includes both full-service sales and delivery service to
    customers who choose to buy generation service from an
    alternative electric supplier, but excludes transactions with
    other wholesale market participants and other electric
    utilities. Growth from year to year may vary from this trend due
    to customer response to the following:

•

energy conservation measures,

CMS-25

•

fluctuations in weather conditions, and

•

changes in economic conditions, including utilization and
    expansion or contraction of manufacturing facilities.

Electric Customer Revenue Outlook:

Closures and
    restructuring of automotive manufacturing facilities and related
    suppliers and the sluggish housing market have hampered
    Michigan’s economy. The Michigan economy also has had
    facility closures in the non-manufacturing sector and limited
    growth. Although our electric utility results are not dependent
    upon a single customer, or even a few customers, those in the
    automotive sector represented five percent of our total 2007
    electric revenue. We cannot predict the financial impact of the
    Michigan economy on our electric customer revenue.

Electric Reserve Margin:

To reduce the risk of high
    power supply costs during peak demand periods and to achieve our
    Reserve Margin target, we purchase electric capacity and energy
    contracts for the physical delivery of electricity primarily in
    the summer months and to a lesser extent in the winter months.
    We have purchased capacity and energy contracts covering a
    portion of our Reserve Margin requirements for 2008 through
    2010. We are currently planning for a Reserve Margin of
    13.7 percent for summer 2008, or supply resources equal to
    113.7 percent of projected firm summer peak load. Of the
    2008 supply resources target, we expect 93 percent to come
    from our electric generating plants and long-term power purchase
    contracts, with other contractual arrangements making up the
    remainder. We expect capacity costs for these electric capacity
    and energy contracts to be $21 million for 2008.

In September 2007, we exercised the regulatory-out provision in
    the MCV PPA, thus limiting the amount we pay the MCV Partnership
    for capacity and fixed energy to the amount recoverable from our
    customers. The MCV Partnership may, under certain circumstances,
    have the right to terminate the MCV PPA, which could affect our
    Reserve Margin status. The MCV PPA represents approximately
    13 percent of our 2008 expected supply resources. For
    additional details, see “The MCV PPA” within this
    MD&A.

Electric Transmission Expenses:

In 2008, we expect
    transmission rates charged to us to increase by $42 million
    due primarily to a 33 percent increase in METC transmission
    rates. This increase was included in our 2008 PSCR plan filed
    with the MPSC in September 2007.

In September 2007, the FERC approved a proposal to include
    100 percent of the costs of network upgrades associated
    with new generator interconnections in the rates of certain MISO
    transmission owners, including METC. Previously, those
    transmission owners shared interconnection network upgrade costs
    with generators. Consumers, Detroit Edison, the MPSC, and other
    parties filed a request for rehearing of the FERC order.

21st Century Electric Energy Plan:

In January
    2007, the then chairman of the MPSC proposed initiatives to the
    governor of Michigan for the use of more renewable energy
    resources by all load-serving entities such as Consumers, the
    creation of an energy efficiency program, and a procedure for
    reviewing proposals to construct new generation facilities. The
    January proposal indicated that Michigan will need new base-load
    capacity by 2015. The proposed initiatives will require changes
    to current legislation.

Balanced Energy Initiative:

In response to the
    21st Century Electric Energy Plan, we filed with the MPSC a
    “Balanced Energy Initiative” that provides a
    comprehensive energy resource plan to meet our projected
    short-term and long-term electric power requirements. The filing
    requests the MPSC to rule that the Balanced Energy Initiative
    represents a reasonable and prudent plan for the acquisition of
    necessary electric utility resources. Implementation of the
    Balanced Energy Initiative will require legislative repeal or
    significant reform of the Customer Choice Act.

In September 2007, we filed with the MPSC an updated Balanced
    Energy Initiative, which includes our plan to build an
    800 MW advanced clean coal plant at our Karn/Weadock
    Generating complex near Bay City, Michigan. We expect to use
    500 MW of the plant’s output to serve Consumers’
    customers and to commit the remaining 300 MW to others. We
    expect the plant to begin operating in 2015. We estimate our
    share of the cost at $1.6 billion including financing
    costs. Construction of the proposed new clean coal plant is
    contingent upon obtaining environmental permits and MPSC
    approval.

The Michigan Attorney General filed a motion with the MPSC to
    dismiss the Balanced Energy Initiative case, claiming that the
    MPSC lacks jurisdiction over the matter, which the ALJ denied.
    The Michigan Attorney General and another intervenor have filed
    an appeal of that decision with the MPSC.

Proposed Energy Legislation:

There are various bills
    introduced and being considered in the U.S. Congress and
    the Michigan legislature relating to mandatory renewable energy
    standards. If enacted, these bills generally would require
    electric utilities either to acquire a certain percentage of
    their power from renewable sources or pay fees, or purchase
    allowances in lieu of having the resources. Also in December
    2007, several bills were introduced in the Michigan legislature
    that would reform the Customer Choice Act, introduce energy
    efficiency programs, modify the timing of rate increase
    requests, amend customer rate design and provide for other
    regulatory changes. We cannot predict whether any of these bills
    will be enacted or what form the final legislation might take.

Power Plant Purchase:

In December 2007, we purchased
    a 935 MW gas-fired power plant located in Zeeland, Michigan
    for $519 million from Broadway Gen Funding LLC, an
    affiliate of LS Power Group. The power plant will help meet the
    growing energy needs of our customers.

ELECTRIC UTILITY
    BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES

Several electric business trends and uncertainties may affect
    our financial condition and future results of operations. These
    trends and uncertainties have, had, or are reasonably expected
    to have, a material impact on revenues and income from
    continuing electric operations.

Electric Environmental Estimates:

Our operations are
    subject to various state and federal environmental laws and
    regulations. We have been able to recover our costs to operate
    our facilities in compliance with these laws and regulations in
    customer rates.

Clean Air Act:

Compliance with the federal Clean Air
    Act and resulting state and federal regulations continues to be
    a major focus for us. The State of Michigan’s Nitrogen
    Oxides Implementation Plan requires significant reductions in
    nitrogen oxides emissions. From 1998 to present, we have
    incurred $786 million in capital expenditures to comply
    with this plan, including installing selective catalytic
    reduction control technology on three of our coal-fired electric
    generating units. We have also installed low nitrogen oxides
    burners on a number of our coal-fired electric generating units.

Clean Air Interstate Rule:

In March 2005, the EPA
    adopted the Clean Air Interstate Rule that requires additional
    coal-fired electric generating plant emission controls for
    nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. We plan to meet the nitrogen
    oxides requirements by:

•

operating our selective catalytic reduction control technology
    units throughout the year,

•

completing the installation of a fourth selective catalytic
    reduction control unit,

•

installing low nitrogen oxides burners, and

•

purchasing emission allowances.

We plan to meet the sulfur dioxide requirements by injecting a
    chemical that reduces sulfur dioxide emissions, installing
    scrubbers and purchasing emission allowances. We plan to spend
    an additional $835 million for equipment installation
    through 2015, which we expect to recover in customer rates. The
    key assumptions in the capital expenditure estimate include:

•

construction commodity prices, especially construction material
    and labor,

•

project completion schedules and spending plans,

•

cost escalation factor used to estimate future years’ costs
    of 3.2 percent, and

•

an AFUDC capitalization rate of 7.9 percent.

We will need to purchase additional nitrogen oxides emission
    allowances through 2011 at an estimated cost of $3 million
    per year. We will also need to purchase additional sulfur
    dioxide emission allowances in 2012 and 2013 at an estimated
    cost of $10 million per year. We expect to recover
    emissions allowance costs from our customers through the PSCR
    process.

CMS-27

The Clean Air Interstate Rule was appealed to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by a
    number of utilities and other companies. A decision is expected
    in 2008. We cannot predict the outcome of these appeals.

State and Federal Mercury Air Rules:

In March 2005,
    the EPA issued the CAMR, which requires initial reductions of
    mercury emissions from coal-fired electric generating plants by
    2010 and further reductions by 2018. Certain portions of the
    CAMR were appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    District of Columbia by a number of states and other entities.
    The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    decided the case on February 8, 2008, and determined that
    the rates developed by the EPA were not consistent with the
    Clean Air Act. We continue to monitor the development of federal
    regulation in this area.

In April 2006, Michigan’s governor proposed a plan that
    would result in mercury emissions reductions of 90 percent
    by 2015. We are working with the MDEQ on the details of this
    plan; however, we have developed preliminary cost estimates and
    a mercury emissions reduction scenario based on our best
    knowledge of control technology options and initially proposed
    requirements. We estimate that costs associated with Phase I of
    the state’s mercury plan will be approximately
    $280 million by 2010 and an additional $200 million by
    2015. The key assumptions in the capital expenditure estimate
    are the same as those stated for the Clean Air Interstate Rule.

The following table outlines the proposed state mercury plan:

Phase I

Phase II

Proposed State Mercury Rule

30% reduction by 2010

90% reduction by 2015

Routine Maintenance Classification:

The EPA has
    alleged that some utilities have incorrectly classified plant
    modifications as “routine maintenance” rather than
    seeking permits from the EPA to modify their plants. We
    responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject
    in 2000, 2002, and 2006. We believe that we have properly
    interpreted the requirements of “routine maintenance.”
    If the EPA finds that our interpretation is incorrect, we could
    be required to install additional pollution controls at some or
    all of our coal-fired electric generating plants and pay fines.
    Additionally, we would need to assess the viability of
    continuing operations at certain plants. We cannot predict the
    financial impact or outcome of this issue.

Greenhouse Gases:

Several legislative proposals have
    been introduced in the United States Congress that would require
    reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon
    dioxide. These laws, or similar state laws or rules, if enacted
    could require us to replace equipment, install additional
    equipment for pollution controls, purchase allowances, curtail
    operations, or take other steps. Although associated capital or
    operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or
    legislation could be material, and cost recovery cannot be
    assured, we expect to have an opportunity to recover these costs
    and capital expenditures in rates consistent with the recovery
    of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws
    and regulations.

To the extent that greenhouse gas emission reduction rules come
    into effect, the mandatory emissions reduction requirements
    could have far-reaching and significant implications for the
    energy sector. We cannot estimate the effect of federal or state
    greenhouse gas policy on our future consolidated results of
    operations, cash flows, or financial position due to the
    uncertain nature of the policies. However, we will continue to
    monitor greenhouse gas policy developments and assess and
    respond to their potential implications for our business
    operations.

Water:

In March 2004, the EPA issued rules that
    govern electric generating plant cooling water intake systems.
    The rules require significant reduction in the number of fish
    harmed by operating equipment. EPA compliance options in the
    rule were challenged in court. In January 2007, the court
    rejected many of the compliance options favored by industry and
    remanded the bulk of the rule back to the EPA for
    reconsideration. The court’s ruling is expected to increase
    significantly the cost of complying with this rule. However, the
    cost to comply will not be known until the EPA’s
    reconsideration is complete. At this time, the EPA is developing
    rules to implement the court’s decision. The rules are
    expected to be released for public comment in late 2008.

For additional details on electric environmental matters, see
    Note 3, Contingencies, “Consumers’ Electric
    Utility Contingencies — Electric Environmental
    Matters.”

CMS-28

Electric ROA:

The Customer Choice Act allows all of
    our electric customers to buy electric generation service from
    us or from an alternative electric supplier. At
    December 31, 2007, alternative electric suppliers were
    providing 315 MW of generation service to ROA customers.
    This is 4 percent of our total distribution load and
    represents an increase of 5 percent of ROA load compared to
    December 31, 2006.

In November 2004, the MPSC issued an order allowing us to
    recover Stranded Costs incurred in 2002 and 2003 through a
    surcharge applied to ROA customers. Since the MPSC order, we
    have experienced a downward trend in ROA customers. If this
    trend continues, it may require legislative or regulatory
    assistance to recover fully our 2002 and 2003 Stranded Costs.

Electric Rate Case:

During 2007, we filed
    applications with the MPSC seeking an 11.25 percent
    authorized return on equity and an annual increase in revenues
    of $269 million. The filings sought recovery of the costs
    associated with increased plant investment, including the
    purchase of the Zeeland power plant, increased equity
    investment, higher operation and maintenance expenses, recovery
    of transaction costs from the sale of Palisades, and the
    approval of an energy efficiency program.

In December 2007, the MPSC approved a rate increase of
    $70 million related to the purchase of the Zeeland power
    plant. For additional details and material changes relating to
    the restructuring of the electric utility industry and electric
    rate matters, see Note 3, Contingencies,
    “Consumers’ Electric Utility Rate Matters.”

The MCV PPA:

The MCV Partnership, which leases and
    operates the MCV Facility, contracted to sell electricity to
    Consumers for a

35-year

period beginning in 1990. In September 2007, we exercised the
    regulatory-out provision in the MCV PPA, thus limiting the
    amount we pay the MCV Partnership for capacity and fixed energy
    to the amount recoverable from our customers. The MCV
    Partnership has notified us that it disputes our right to
    exercise the regulatory-out provision. We believe that the
    provision is valid and fully effective and have not recorded any
    reserves, but we cannot predict whether we would prevail in the
    event of litigation on this issue.

As a result of our exercise of the regulatory-out provision, the
    MCV Partnership may, under certain circumstances, have the right
    to terminate the MCV PPA or reduce the amount of capacity sold
    under the MCV PPA. If the MCV Partnership terminates or reduces
    the amount of capacity sold under the MCV PPA, we will seek to
    replace the lost capacity to maintain an adequate electric
    Reserve Margin. This could involve entering into a new power
    purchase agreement and (or) entering into electric capacity
    contracts on the open market. We cannot predict whether we could
    enter into such contracts at a reasonable price. We are also
    unable to predict whether we would receive regulatory approval
    of the terms and conditions of such contracts, or whether the
    MPSC would allow full recovery of our incurred costs.

To comply with a prior MPSC order, we made a filing in May 2007
    with the MPSC requesting a determination as to whether it wished
    to reconsider the amount of the MCV PPA payments that we recover
    from customers. In May 2007, the MCV Partnership also filed an
    application with the MPSC seeking approval to increase our
    recovery of costs incurred under the MCV PPA. We cannot predict
    the financial impact or outcome of these matters. For additional
    details on the MCV PPA, see Note 3, Contingencies,
    “Other Consumers’ Electric Utility Contingencies - The
    MCV PPA.”

Sale of Nuclear Assets:

In April 2007, we sold
    Palisades to Entergy for $380 million and received
    $363 million after various closing adjustments. We also
    paid Entergy $30 million to assume ownership and
    responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI. In addition, we paid the
    NMC, the former operator of Palisades, $7 million in exit
    fees and forfeited our $5 million investment in the NMC.
    The MPSC order approving the Palisades transaction allowed us to
    recover the book value of Palisades. As a result, we are
    crediting proceeds in excess of book value of $66 million
    to our customers through the end of 2008. After closing
    adjustments, which are subject to MPSC review, proceeds in
    excess of the book value were $77 million. Recovery of our
    transaction costs of $28 million, which includes the NMC
    exit fees and investment forfeiture, is presently under review
    by the MPSC in our current electric rate case.

Entergy assumed responsibility for the future decommissioning of
    Palisades and for storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at
    Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI sites. We transferred
    $252 million in trust fund assets to Entergy. We are
    crediting excess decommissioning funds of $189 million to
    our retail customers through the end of

CMS-29

2008. Modification to the terms of the transaction allowed us
    immediate access to additional excess decommissioning trust
    funds of $123 million. The distribution of these funds is
    currently under review by the

CMS-29.1

MPSC in our electric rate case filing. For additional details on
    the sale of Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI, see Note 2,
    Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations and Impairment Charges.

As part of the transaction, we entered into a

15-year

power purchase agreement under which Entergy sells us all of the
    plant’s output up to its current annual average capacity of
    798 MW. Because of the Palisades power purchase agreement
    and our continuing involvement with the Palisades assets, we
    accounted for the disposal of Palisades as a financing for
    accounting purposes and not a sale. For additional details on
    the Palisades financing, see Note 11, Leases.

GAS UTILITY
    BUSINESS OUTLOOK

Growth:

In 2008, we project that gas deliveries will
    remain flat, on a weather-adjusted basis, relative to 2007
    levels due to continuing conservation and overall economic
    conditions in Michigan. We expect gas deliveries to decline by
    less than one-half of one percent annually over the next five
    years. Actual gas deliveries in future periods may be affected
    by:

•

fluctuations in weather conditions,

•

use by independent power producers,

•

availability of renewable energy sources,

•

changes in gas commodity prices,

•

Michigan economic conditions,

•

the price of competing energy sources or fuels,

•

gas consumption per customer, and

•

improvements in gas appliance efficiency.

GAS UTILITY
    BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES

Several gas business trends and uncertainties may affect our
    future financial results and financial condition. These trends
    and uncertainties could have a material impact on future
    revenues and income from gas operations.

Gas Environmental Estimates:

We expect to incur
    investigation and remedial action costs at a number of sites,
    including 23 former manufactured gas plant sites. For additional
    details, see Note 3, Contingencies, “Consumers’
    Gas Utility Contingencies — Gas Environmental
    Matters.”

Gas Cost Recovery:

The GCR process is designed to
    allow us to recover all of our purchased natural gas costs if
    incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.
    The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices for
    prudency in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. For
    additional details on GCR, see Note 3, Contingencies,
    “Consumers’ Gas Utility Rate Matters — Gas
    Cost Recovery.”

Gas Depreciation:

In June 2007, the MPSC issued its
    final order in a generic ARO accounting case and modified the
    filing requirement for our next gas depreciation case. The
    original filing requirement date was changed from 90 days
    after the issuance of that order to no later than August 1,
    2008. Additionally, we have been ordered to use 2007 data and
    prepare a cost-of-removal depreciation study with five
    alternatives using the MPSC’s prescribed methods. We cannot
    predict the outcome of the analysis.

If a final order in our next gas depreciation case is not issued
    concurrently with a final order in a general gas rate case, the
    MPSC may incorporate the results of the depreciation case into
    general gas rates through a surcharge, which may be either
    positive or negative.

2007 Gas Rate Case:

In February 2007, we filed an
    application with the MPSC seeking an 11.25 percent
    authorized return on equity as part of an $88 million
    annual increase in our gas delivery and transportation rates. In
    August 2007, the MPSC approved a partial settlement agreement
    authorizing an annual rate increase of $50 million,
    including an authorized return on equity of 10.75 percent.
    On September 25, 2007, the MPSC reopened the record in the
    case to allow all interested parties to be heard concerning the
    approval of an energy efficiency program, which

CMS-30

we proposed in our original filing. Hearings on this matter were
    held in February 2008. We expect the MPSC to issue a final order
    in the second quarter of 2008. If approved in total, this would
    result in an additional rate increase of $9 million for
    implementation of the energy efficiency program.

2008 Gas Rate Case:

In February 2008, we filed an
    application with the MPSC for an annual gas rate increase of
    $91 million and an 11 percent authorized return on
    equity.

ENTERPRISES
    OUTLOOK

In 2007, we completed the sale of our international assets. Our
    primary focus with respect to our remaining non-utility
    businesses is to optimize cash flow and maximize the value of
    these assets.

In connection with the sale of our Argentine and Michigan assets
    to Lucid Energy in March 2007, we entered into agreements that
    grant Lucid Energy:

•

an option to buy CMS Gas Transmission’s ownership interest
    in TGN, subject to the rights of other third parties,

•

the rights to certain proceeds that may be awarded and received
    by CMS Gas Transmission in connection with certain legal
    proceedings, including an ICSID arbitration award, and

•

the rights to proceeds that Enterprises will receive if it sells
    its interest in CMS Generation San Nicolas Company.

Under these agreements, we have assigned our rights to certain
    awards or proceeds that we may receive in the future. Of the
    total consideration received in the sale, we allocated
    $32 million to these agreements and recorded this amount as
    a deferred credit on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the
    settlement of certain legal proceedings in 2007, a portion of
    CMS Gas Transmission’s obligations under these agreements
    has been satisfied. Accordingly, we recognized $17 million
    of the deferred credit as a gain.

For details on the ICSID arbitration award, see Note 3,
    Contingencies.

Uncertainties:

Trends and uncertainties that could
    have a material impact on our consolidated income, cash flows,
    or balance sheet and credit improvement include:

•

the impact of indemnity and environmental remediation
    obligations at Bay Harbor,

•

the outcome of certain legal proceedings,

•

the impact of representations, warranties, and related
    indemnities in connection with the sales of our international
    assets, and

•

changes in commodity prices and interest rates on certain
    derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting
    and must be marked to market through earnings.

CMS ERM Electricity Sales Agreements:

CMS ERM was a
    party to three electricity sales agreements, under which it
    provided up to 300 MW of electricity at fixed prices. CMS
    ERM satisfied its obligations under these agreements by using
    electricity generated by DIG or by purchasing electricity from
    the market. Because the price of natural gas has increased
    substantially in recent years, the prices that were charged
    under these agreements did not reflect DIG’s cost to
    generate or CMS ERM’s cost to purchase electricity from the
    market. Therefore, these agreements negatively impacted
    DIG’s and CMS ERM’s financial performance.

In November 2007, CMS ERM, DIG, and CMS Energy reached an
    agreement to terminate two of these electricity sales agreements
    in order to eliminate future losses under those contracts. As
    consideration for agreeing to terminate the agreements, CMS ERM
    paid the customers $275 million upon closing the
    transaction in February 2008. We recorded a liability for the
    future payment and other termination costs and recognized a loss
    of $279 million in 2007, representing the cost to terminate
    the agreements. As a result of terminating these agreements, CMS
    ERM and DIG have reduced their long-term electric capacity
    supply obligations by 260 MW. CMS ERM will market the
    capacity and energy that was previously committed under these
    agreements into the merchant market either through third party
    agreements or directly with the MISO.

CMS-31

Also in November 2007, CMS ERM executed an amendment of the
    remaining electricity sales agreement, which was effective upon
    the closing of the transaction. The purpose of the amendment is
    to optimize production planning and ensure optimal use of
    available resources. The amendment establishes a minimum amount
    of contract capacity to be provided under the agreement, and
    adds a minimum and maximum amount of electricity to be delivered
    to the customer. As amended, this electricity sales agreement is
    a derivative instrument. Upon signing the amendment in 2007, we
    recorded our minimum obligation under the contract on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value and recognized the
    resulting mark-to-market loss of $18 million in earnings.
    For additional details on accounting for this derivative, see
    Note 6, Financial and Derivative Instruments.

OTHER
    OUTLOOK

Advanced Metering Infrastructure:

We are developing
    an advanced meter system that will provide more frequent
    information about our customer energy usage and notification of
    service interruptions. The system will allow customers to make
    decisions about energy efficiency and conservation, provide
    other customer benefits, and reduce costs. We anticipate
    developing integration software and piloting new technology over
    the next two years. We expect capital expenditures for this
    project over the next seven years to be approximately
    $800 million. Over the long-term, we do not expect this
    project to significantly impact rates.

Software Implementation:

We are implementing an
    integrated business software system for finance,
    purchasing/supply chain, customer billing, human resources and
    payroll, and utility asset construction and maintenance work
    management. We expect the new business software, scheduled to be
    in production in the first half of 2008, to improve customer
    service, reduce risk, and increase flexibility. Including work
    done to date, we expect to incur $175 million in operating
    expenses and capital expenditures for the initial implementation.

Michigan Public Service Commission:

During the third
    quarter of 2007, the Michigan governor appointed a new MPSC
    chairperson and a new MPSC commissioner. We have several
    significant cases pending MPSC review and approval. For
    additional detail on these cases, see Note 3,
    Contingencies, “Consumers’ Electric Utility Rate
    Matters” and “Consumers’ Gas Utility Rate
    Matters.”

Litigation and Regulatory Investigation:

We are the
    subject of an investigation by the DOJ regarding round-trip
    trading transactions by CMS MST. Also, we are named as a party
    in various litigation matters including, but not limited to,
    several lawsuits regarding alleged false natural gas price
    reporting and price manipulation. Additionally, the SEC is
    investigating the actions of former CMS Energy subsidiaries in
    relation to Equatorial Guinea. For additional details regarding
    these and other matters, see Note 3, Contingencies and
    Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Michigan Tax Legislation:

In July 2007, the Michigan
    governor signed Senate Bill 94, the Michigan Business Tax Act,
    which imposed a business income tax of 4.95 percent and a
    modified gross receipts tax of 0.8 percent. The bill
    provided for a number of tax credits and incentives geared
    toward those companies investing and employing in Michigan. The
    Michigan Business Tax, which was effective January 1, 2008,
    replaced the state’s Single Business Tax that expired on
    December 31, 2007. In September 2007, the Michigan governor
    signed House Bill 5104, allowing additional deductions in future
    years against the business income portion of the tax. These
    future deductions are phased in over a

15-year

period, beginning in 2015. As a result, our consolidated net
    deferred tax liability of $122 million, recorded due to the
    Michigan Business Tax enactment, was offset by a net deferred
    tax asset of $122 million. In December 2007, the Michigan
    governor signed House Bill 5408, replacing the expanded sales
    tax for certain services with a 21.99 percent surcharge on
    the business income tax and the modified gross receipts tax.
    Therefore, the total tax rates imposed under the Michigan
    Business Tax are 6.04 percent for the business income tax
    and 0.98 percent for the modified gross receipts tax. We
    expect to recover the taxes that we pay from our customers, but
    we cannot predict the timeliness of such recovery.

IMPLEMENTATION OF
    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SFAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R):

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 158. Phase one of this standard, implemented
    in December 2006, required us to recognize the funded

CMS-32

status of our defined benefit postretirement plans on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006. Phase two
    requires that we change our plan measurement date from November
    30 to December 31, effective for the year ending
    December 31, 2008. The implementation of phase two of this
    standard will not have a material effect on our consolidated
    financial statements.

FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes:

This interpretation, which we adopted on
    January 1, 2007, provides a two-step approach for the
    recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken, or
    expected to be taken, by a company on its income tax returns.
    The first step is to evaluate the tax position to determine if,
    based on management’s best judgment, it is greater than
    50 percent likely that we will sustain the tax position.
    The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the
    benefit to recognize. This is done by estimating the potential
    outcomes and recognizing the greatest amount that has a
    cumulative probability of at least 50 percent. FIN 48
    requires interest and penalties, if applicable, to be accrued on
    differences between tax positions recognized in our consolidated
    financial statements and the amount claimed, or expected to be
    claimed, on the tax return.

CMS Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated
    U.S. federal income tax return as well as unitary and
    combined income tax returns in several states. CMS Energy and
    its subsidiaries also file separate company income tax returns
    in several states. The only significant state tax paid by CMS
    Energy is in Michigan. However, since the Michigan Single
    Business Tax was not an income tax, it was not part of the
    FIN 48 analysis. For the U.S. federal income tax
    return, CMS Energy completed examinations by federal taxing
    authorities for its taxable years prior to 2002. The federal
    income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2006 are open
    under the statute of limitations, with 2002 through 2005
    currently under examination.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recorded a
    charge for additional uncertain tax benefits of
    $11 million, which was accounted for as a reduction of our
    beginning retained earnings. Included in this amount was an
    increase in our valuation allowance of $100 million,
    decreases to tax reserves of $61 million and a decrease to
    deferred tax liabilities of $28 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, remaining uncertain tax benefits that
    would reduce our effective tax rate in future years are
    $8 million. We are not expecting any other material changes
    to our uncertain tax positions over the next twelve months.

We have reflected a net interest liability of $2 million
    related to our uncertain income tax positions on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2007. We
    have not accrued any penalties with respect to uncertain tax
    benefits. We recognize accrued interest and penalties, where
    applicable, related to uncertain tax benefits as part of income
    tax expense.

NEW ACCOUNTING
    STANDARDS NOT YET EFFECTIVE

SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements:

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 157, effective for us on January 1,
    2008. The standard provides a revised definition of fair value
    and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Under the
    standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
    orderly exchange between market participants. The standard does
    not expand the use of fair value, but it requires new
    disclosures about the impact and reliability of fair value
    measurements. The standard will also eliminate the existing
    prohibition against recognizing “day one” gains and
    losses on derivative instruments. We currently do not hold any
    derivatives that would involve day one gains or losses. The
    standard is to be applied prospectively, except that limited
    retrospective application is required for three types of
    financial instruments, none of which we currently hold. We do
    not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2008, the FASB issued a one-year deferral of
    SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities, except those that are recorded or disclosed at fair
    value on a recurring basis. Under this partial deferral,
    SFAS No. 157 will not be effective until
    January 1, 2009 for fair value measurements in the
    following areas:

•

AROs,

•

most of the nonfinancial assets and liabilities acquired in a
    business combination, and

•

fair value measurements performed in conjunction with impairment
    analyses.

CMS-33

SFAS No. 157 remains effective January 1, 2008
    for our derivative instruments, available-for-sale investment
    securities, and long-term debt fair value disclosures.

SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an
    amendment to FASB Statement No. 115:

In
    February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, effective
    for us on January 1, 2008. This standard gives us the
    option to measure certain financial instruments and other items
    at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in
    earnings. We do not expect to elect the fair value option for
    any financial instruments or other items.

SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB
    No. 51:

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 160, effective for us January 1, 2009.
    Ownership interests in subsidiaries held by third parties, which
    are currently referred to as minority interests, will be
    presented as noncontrolling interests and shown separately on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets within equity. Any changes in
    our ownership interests while control is retained will be
    treated as equity transactions. In addition, this standard
    requires presentation and disclosure of the allocation between
    controlling and noncontrolling interests’ income from
    continuing operations, discontinued operations, and
    comprehensive income and a reconciliation of changes in the
    consolidated statement of equity during the reporting period.
    The presentation and disclosure requirements of the standard
    will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. All
    other requirements will be applied prospectively. We are
    evaluating the impact SFAS No. 160 will have on our
    consolidated financial statements.

FSP

FIN 39-1,

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39:

In
    April 2007, the FASB issued FSP

FIN 39-1,

effective for us on January 1, 2008. This standard will
    permit us to offset the fair value of derivative instruments
    with cash collateral received or paid for those derivative
    instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master
    netting arrangement. The decision to offset derivative positions
    under master netting arrangements remains an accounting policy
    choice. We have elected to offset our derivative fair values
    under master netting arrangements, but we currently record cash
    collateral amounts separately. As a result of offsetting the
    collateral amounts under this standard, we expect that both our
    total assets and total liabilities will be reduced by an
    immaterial amount. There will be no impact on earnings from
    adopting this standard. The standard is to be applied
    retrospectively for all periods presented in our consolidated
    financial statements.

EITF Issue

06-11,

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards:

In June 2007, the FASB
    ratified EITF Issue

06-11,

effective for us on a prospective basis beginning
    January 1, 2008. EITF Issue

06-11

requires companies to recognize, as an increase to additional
    paid-in capital, the income tax benefit realized from dividends
    or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings
    and paid to employees for non-vested equity-classified employee
    share-based payment awards. We do not believe that
    implementation of this standard will have a material effect on
    our consolidated financial statements.

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES
    TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1: CORPORATE
    STRUCTURE AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Corporate Structure:

CMS Energy is an energy company
    operating primarily in Michigan. We are the parent holding
    company of Consumers and Enterprises. Consumers is a combination
    electric and gas utility company serving in Michigan’s
    Lower Peninsula. Enterprises, through various subsidiaries and
    equity investments, is engaged primarily in domestic independent
    power production. We manage our businesses by the nature of
    services each provides and operate principally in three business
    segments: electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated
    financial statements include CMS Energy, Consumers, Enterprises,
    and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial
    interest or are the primary beneficiary, in accordance with
    FIN 46(R). We use the equity method of accounting for
    investments in companies and partnerships that are not
    consolidated, where we have significant influence over
    operations and financial policies, but are not the primary
    beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany transactions and balances.

Use of Estimates:

We prepare our consolidated
    financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We are
    required to make estimates using assumptions that may affect the
    reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

We record estimated liabilities for contingencies in our
    consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred, and when the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. For additional details, see Note 3,
    Contingencies.

Revenue Recognition Policy:

We recognize revenues
    from deliveries of electricity and natural gas, and from the
    transportation, processing, and storage of natural gas when
    services are provided. We record unbilled revenues for the
    estimated amount of energy delivered to customers but not yet
    billed. We record sales tax on a net basis and exclude it from
    revenues. We recognize revenues on sales of marketed
    electricity, natural gas, and other energy products at delivery.
    For trading and non-trading energy contracts that qualify as
    derivatives, we recognize changes in the fair value of those
    contracts

(mark-to-market

gains and losses) in earnings as the changes occur.

Accounting for Legal Fees:

We expense legal fees as
    incurred; fees incurred but not yet billed are accrued based on
    estimates of work performed. This policy also applies to fees
    incurred on behalf of employees and officers related to
    indemnification agreements; such fees are billed directly to us.

Accounting for MISO Transactions:

MISO requires that
    we submit hourly day-ahead and real-time bids and offers for
    energy at locations across the MISO region. Consumers and CMS
    ERM account for MISO transactions on a net hourly basis in each
    of the real-time and day-ahead markets, and net transactions
    across all MISO energy market locations. We record net purchases
    in a single hour in “Purchased and interchange power”
    and net sales in a single hour in “Operating Revenue”
    in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). We record net
    sale billing adjustments when we receive invoices. We record
    expense accruals for future net purchases adjustments based on
    historical experience, and reconcile accruals to actual expenses
    when we receive invoices.

Capitalized Interest:

We capitalize interest on
    certain qualifying assets that are undergoing activities to
    prepare them for their intended use. Capitalization of interest
    is limited to the actual interest cost incurred. Consumers
    capitalizes AFUDC on regulated construction projects and
    includes these amounts in plant in service.

Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:

Cash
    equivalents are all liquid investments with an original maturity
    of three months or less.

At December 31, 2007, our restricted cash on hand was
    $34 million. We classify restricted cash dedicated for
    repayment of Securitization bonds as a current asset, as the
    related payments occur within one year.

Collective Bargaining Agreements:

At
    December 31, 2007, the Utility Workers of America Union
    represented 46 percent of Consumers’ employees. The
    Union represents Consumers’ operating, maintenance,
    construction, and call center employees.

Determination of Pension MRV of Plan Assets:

We
    determine the MRV for pension plan assets, as defined in
    SFAS No. 87, as the fair value of plan assets on the
    measurement date, adjusted by the gains or losses that will not
    be admitted into MRV until future years. We reflect each
    year’s assets gain or loss in MRV in equal amounts over a
    five-year period beginning on the date the original amount was
    determined. We use the MRV in the calculation of net pension
    cost.

Earnings Per Share:

We calculate basic and diluted
    EPS using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
    and dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the
    period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining
    diluted EPS, includes the effects of dilutive stock options,
    warrants and convertible securities. We compute the effect on
    potential common stock using the treasury stock method or the
    if-converted method, as applicable. Diluted EPS excludes the
    impact of antidilutive securities, which are those securities
    resulting in an increase in EPS or a decrease in loss per share.
    For EPS computation, see Note 5, Earnings Per Share.

Financial and Derivative Instruments:

We record debt
    and equity securities classified as

available-for-sale

at fair value determined primarily from quoted market prices. On
    a specific identification basis, we report unrealized gains and
    losses from changes in fair value of certain

available-for-sale

debt and equity securities, net of tax, in equity as part of
    AOCL. We exclude unrealized losses from earnings unless the
    related changes in fair value are determined to be other than
    temporary. We reflected unrealized gains and losses on our
    nuclear decommissioning investments as regulatory liabilities on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In accordance with SFAS No. 133, if a contract is a
    derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and
    sales exception, it is recorded on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets at its fair value. If a derivative qualifies for cash
    flow hedge accounting, we report changes in its fair value in
    AOCL; otherwise, we report the changes in earnings.

For additional details regarding financial and derivative
    instruments, see Note 6, Financial and Derivative
    Instruments.

Goodwill:

Goodwill is the excess of the purchase
    price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired
    companies. We test goodwill annually for impairment. We
    eliminated our goodwill in 2007 with the sale of several
    Enterprises businesses.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill at the
    Enterprises segment for the years ended December 31, 2006
    and 2007 are included in the following table:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method
    Investments:

We periodically perform tests of
    impairment if certain triggering events occur, or if there has
    been a decline in value that may be other than temporary.

A long-lived asset

held-in-use

is evaluated for impairment by calculating the undiscounted
    future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
    and its eventual disposition. If the undiscounted future cash
    flows are less than the carrying amount, we recognize an
    impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount
    exceeds the fair value. We estimate the fair value of the asset
    using quoted market prices, market prices of similar assets, or
    discounted future cash flow analyses.

We also assess our equity method investments for impairment
    whenever there has been a decline in value that is other than
    temporary. This assessment requires us to determine the fair
    values of our equity method investments. We determine fair value
    using valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows,
    and we assess the ability of the

CMS-45

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the
    carrying amount of the investment. We record an impairment if
    the fair value is less than the carrying value and the decline
    in value is considered to be other than temporary.

For additional details, see Note 2, Asset Sales,
    Discontinued Operations and Impairment Charges.

International Operations and Foreign Currency:

Our
    subsidiaries and affiliates whose functional currency is not the
    U.S. dollar translate their assets and liabilities into
    U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the end of
    the fiscal period. We translate revenue and expense accounts of
    such subsidiaries and affiliates into U.S. dollars at the
    average exchange rates that prevailed during the period. We show
    these foreign currency translation adjustments in the
    stockholders’ equity section on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. We include exchange rate fluctuations on transactions
    denominated in a currency other than the functional currency,
    except those that are hedged, in determining net income.

We completed the sale of our international assets in 2007. For
    additional details, see Note 2, Asset Sales, Discontinued
    Operations, and Impairment Charges.

Inventory:

We use the weighted-average cost method
    for valuing working gas, recoverable cushion gas in underground
    storage facilities, and materials and supplies inventory. We
    also use this method for valuing coal inventory, and we classify
    these costs as generating plant fuel stock on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

We classify emission allowances as materials and supplies
    inventory and use the average cost method to remove amounts from
    inventory as the emission allowances are used to generate power.

Maintenance and Depreciation:

We charge property
    repairs and minor property replacement to maintenance expense.
    We use the direct expense method to account for planned major
    maintenance activities. We charge planned major maintenance
    activities to operating expense unless the cost represents the
    acquisition of additional components or the replacement of an
    existing component. We capitalize the cost of plant additions
    and replacements.

We depreciate utility property using a composite method, in
    which we apply a single MPSC-approved depreciation rate to the
    gross investment in a particular class of property within the
    electric and gas divisions. We perform depreciation studies
    periodically to determine appropriate group lives. The composite
    depreciation rates for our properties are as follows:

Property, Plant, and Equipment:

We record property,
    plant, and equipment at original cost when placed into service.
    When regulated assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of in
    the ordinary course of business, we charge the original cost to
    accumulated depreciation, along with associated cost of removal,
    net of salvage. We recognize gains or losses on the retirement
    or disposal of non-regulated assets in income. For additional
    details, see Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations and
    Note 12, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Cost of
    removal collected from our customers, but not spent, is recorded
    as a regulatory liability.

We capitalize AFUDC on regulated major construction projects.
    AFUDC represents the estimated cost of debt and a reasonable
    return on equity funds used to finance construction additions.
    We record the offsetting credit of AFUDC capitalized as a
    reduction of interest for the amount representing the borrowed
    funds component and as other income for the equity funds
    component in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). When
    construction is completed and the property is placed in service,
    we depreciate and recover the capitalized AFUDC from our
    customers over the life of the related asset. The following

Reclassifications:

We have reclassified certain
    prior-period amounts on our Consolidated Financial Statements to
    conform to the presentation for the current period. These
    reclassifications did not affect consolidated net loss or cash
    flows for the periods presented. The most significant of these
    reclassifications is related to certain subsidiaries
    reclassified as “held for sale” on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets and activities of those subsidiaries as Income
    (Loss) From Discontinued Operations in our Consolidated
    Statements of Income (Loss). For additional details, see
    Note 2, Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations and Impairment
    Charges, “Discontinued Operations.”

Trade Receivables and Notes Receivable:

Accounts
    receivable are primarily composed of trade receivables and
    unbilled receivables. We record our accounts receivable at cost
    which approximates fair value. Unbilled receivables were
    $490 million in 2007 and $355 million in 2006. We
    establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts and loan
    losses based on historical losses and management’s
    assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and
    other factors. We assess late payment fees on trade receivables
    based on contractual past-due terms established with customers.
    We charge accounts deemed uncollectible to operating expense.

Unamortized Debt Premium, Discount, and Expense:

We
    capitalize premiums, discounts, and costs of long-term debt and
    amortize those costs over the terms of the debt issues. For the
    non-regulated portions of our businesses, we expense any
    refinancing costs as incurred. For the regulated portions of our
    businesses, if we refinance debt, we capitalize any remaining
    unamortized premiums, discounts, and expenses and amortize them
    over the terms of the newly issued debt.

Utility Regulation:

Consumers is subject to the
    actions of the MPSC and FERC and prepare its consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 71. As a result, Consumers may defer or
    recognize revenues and expenses differently than a non-regulated
    entity. For example, Consumers may record as regulatory assets
    items that a non-regulated entity normally would expense if the
    actions of the regulator indicate such expenses will be
    recovered in future rates. Conversely, Consumers may record as
    regulatory liabilities items that non-regulated entities may
    normally recognize as revenues if the actions of the regulator
    indicate they will require that such revenues be refunded to
    customers.

We reflect the following regulatory assets and liabilities,
    which include both current and non-current amounts, on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2007.

New Accounting Standards Not Yet
    Effective:

SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
    Measurements

: In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 157, effective for us on January 1,
    2008. The standard provides a revised definition of fair value
    and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Under the
    standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
    orderly exchange between market participants. The standard does
    not expand the use of fair value, but it requires new
    disclosures about the impact and reliability of fair value
    measurements. The standard will also eliminate the existing
    prohibition against recognizing “day one” gains and
    losses on derivative instruments. We currently do not hold any
    derivatives that would involve day one gains or losses. The
    standard is to be applied prospectively, except that limited
    retrospective application is required for three types of
    financial instruments, none of which we currently hold. We do
    not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2008, the FASB issued a one-year deferral of
    SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities, except those that are recorded or disclosed at fair
    value on a recurring basis. Under this partial deferral,
    SFAS No. 157 will not be effective until
    January 1, 2009 for fair value measurements in the
    following areas:

•

AROs,

•

most of the nonfinancial assets and liabilities acquired in a
    business combination, and

•

fair value measurements performed in conjunction with impairment
    analyses.

SFAS No. 157 remains effective January 1, 2008
    for our derivative instruments,

available-for-sale

investment securities, and long-term debt fair value disclosures.

SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial
    Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment to FASB
    Statement No. 115:

In February 2007, the FASB
    issued SFAS No. 159, effective for us on
    January 1, 2008. This standard gives us the option to
    measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair
    value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. We do
    not expect to elect the fair value option for any financial
    instruments or other items.

SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB
    No. 51:

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 160, effective for us January 1, 2009.
    Ownership interests in

CMS-50

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

subsidiaries held by third parties, which are currently referred
    to as minority interests, will be presented as noncontrolling
    interests and shown separately on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets within equity. Any changes in our ownership interests
    while control is retained will be treated as equity
    transactions. In addition, this standard requires presentation
    and disclosure of the allocation between controlling and
    noncontrolling interests’ income from continuing
    operations, discontinued operations, and comprehensive income
    and a reconciliation of changes in the consolidated statement of
    equity during the reporting period. The presentation and
    disclosure requirements of the standard will be applied
    retrospectively for all periods presented. All other
    requirements will be applied prospectively. We are evaluating
    the impact SFAS No. 160 will have on our consolidated
    financial statements.

FSP

FIN 39-1,

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39:

In
    April 2007, the FASB issued FSP

FIN 39-1,

effective for us on January 1, 2008. This standard will
    permit us to offset the fair value of derivative instruments
    with cash collateral received or paid for those derivative
    instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master
    netting arrangement. The decision to offset derivative positions
    under master netting arrangements remains an accounting policy
    choice. We have elected to offset our derivative fair values
    under master netting arrangements, but we currently record cash
    collateral amounts separately. As a result of offsetting the
    collateral amounts under this standard, we expect that both our
    total assets and total liabilities will be reduced by an
    immaterial amount. There will be no impact on earnings from
    adopting this standard. The standard is to be applied
    retrospectively for all periods presented in our consolidated
    financial statements.

EITF Issue

06-11,

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based
    Payment Awards:

In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF
    Issue

06-11,

effective for us on a prospective basis beginning
    January 1, 2008. EITF Issue

06-11

requires companies to recognize, as an increase to additional
    paid-in capital, the income tax benefit realized from dividends
    or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings
    and paid to employees for non-vested equity-classified employee
    share-based payment awards. We do not believe that
    implementation of this standard will have a material effect on
    our consolidated financial statements.

(a)

We sold 36 parcels of land near Ludington, Michigan. Consumers
    held a majority share of the land, which we co-owned with DTE
    Energy.

(b)

In November 2006, we sold all of our interests in the
    Consumers’ subsidiaries that held the MCV Partnership and
    the MCV Facility to an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners and
    Rockland Capital Energy Investments.

Because of the MCV PPA, the transaction is a sale and leaseback
    for accounting purposes. SFAS No. 98 specifies the
    accounting required for a seller’s sale and simultaneous
    leaseback involving real estate. We have continuing involvement
    with the MCV Partnership through an existing guarantee
    associated with the future operations of the MCV Facility. As a
    result, we accounted for the MCV Facility as a financing for
    accounting purposes and not a sale. The value of the finance
    obligation was based on an allocation of the transaction
    proceeds to the fair values of the net assets sold and fair
    value of the MCV Facility under the financing. The total
    proceeds of $61 million (excluding $3 million of
    selling expenses) were less than the fair value of the net
    assets sold. As a result, there were no proceeds remaining to
    allocate to the MCV Facility; therefore, we recorded no finance
    obligation.

The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of
    $41 million, which includes a reclassification of
    $30 million of AOCI into earnings, an $80 million
    impairment charge on the MCV Facility, an $8 million gain
    on the removal of our interests in the MCV Partnership and the
    MCV Facility, and $1 million benefit in general taxes. Upon
    the sale of our interests in the MCV Partnership and the FMLP,
    we were no longer the primary beneficiary of these entities and
    the entities were deconsolidated.

3: CONTINGENCIES

DOJ Investigation:

From May 2000 through January
    2002, CMS MST engaged in simultaneous, prearranged commodity
    trading transactions in which energy commodities were sold and
    repurchased at the same price. These transactions, referred to
    as round-trip trades, had no impact on previously reported
    consolidated net income, EPS or cash flows, but had the effect
    of increasing operating revenues and operating expenses by equal
    amounts. CMS Energy is cooperating with an investigation by the
    DOJ concerning round-trip trading, which the DOJ commenced in
    May 2002. CMS Energy is unable to predict the outcome of this
    matter and what effect, if any, this investigation will have on
    its business.

SEC Investigation and Settlement:

In March 2004, the
    SEC approved a

cease-and-desist

order settling an administrative action against CMS Energy
    related to round-trip trading. The order did not assess a fine
    and CMS Energy neither admitted to nor denied the order’s
    findings. The settlement resolved the SEC investigation
    involving CMS Energy and CMS MST. Also in March 2004, the SEC
    filed an action against three former employees related to
    round-trip trading at CMS MST. One of the individuals has
    settled with the SEC. CMS Energy is currently advancing legal
    defense costs for the remaining two individuals in accordance
    with existing indemnification policies. The two individuals
    filed a motion to dismiss the SEC action, which was denied.

Securities Class Action Settlement:

Beginning
    in May 2002, a number of complaints were filed against CMS
    Energy, Consumers and certain officers and directors of CMS
    Energy and its affiliates in the United States District Court
    for the Eastern District of Michigan. The cases were
    consolidated into a single lawsuit (the “Shareholder
    Action”), which generally seeks unspecified damages based
    on allegations that the defendants violated United States
    securities laws and regulations by making allegedly false and
    misleading statements about CMS Energy’s business and
    financial condition, particularly with respect to revenues and
    expenses recorded in connection with round-trip trading by CMS
    MST. In January 2005, the court granted a motion to dismiss
    Consumers and three of the individual defendants, but denied the
    motions to dismiss CMS Energy and the 13 remaining individual
    defendants. In March 2006, the court conditionally certified a
    class consisting of “all persons who purchased CMS Common
    Stock during the period of October 25, 2000 through and
    including May 17, 2002 and who were damaged thereby.”
    The court excluded purchasers of CMS Energy’s
    8.75 percent Adjustable Convertible
    Trust Securities (“ACTS”) from the class and, in
    response, a new class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of ACTS
    purchasers (the “ACTS Action”) against the same
    defendants named in the Shareholder Action. The settlement
    described in the following paragraph has resolved both the
    Shareholder and ACTS Actions.

On January 3, 2007, CMS Energy and other parties entered
    into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”),
    subject to court approval, regarding settlement of the two class
    action lawsuits. The settlement was approved by a special
    committee of independent directors and by the full Board of
    Directors. Both judged that it was in the best interests of
    shareholders to eliminate this business uncertainty. Under the
    terms of the MOU, the litigation was settled for a total of
    $200 million, including the cost of administering the
    settlement and any attorney fees the court awards. CMS Energy
    made a payment of approximately $123 million plus interest
    on the settlement amount on September 20, 2007. CMS
    Energy’s insurers paid $77 million, the balance of the
    settlement amount. In entering into the MOU, CMS Energy made no
    admission of liability under the Shareholder Action and the ACTS
    Action. The parties executed a Stipulation and Agreement of
    Settlement dated May 22, 2007 (“Stipulation”)
    incorporating the terms of the MOU. In accordance with the
    Stipulation, CMS Energy paid approximately $1 million of
    the settlement amount to fund administrative expenses. On
    September 6, 2007, the court issued a final order approving
    the settlement. The remaining settlement amount was paid
    following the September 6, 2007 hearing.

Gas Index Price Reporting Investigation:

CMS Energy
    notified appropriate regulatory and governmental agencies that
    some employees at CMS MST and CMS Field Services appeared to
    have provided inaccurate information regarding natural gas
    trades to various energy industry publications, which compile
    and report index prices. CMS Energy cooperated with an
    investigation by the DOJ regarding this matter. Although CMS
    Energy has not received any formal notification that the DOJ has
    completed its investigation, the DOJ’s last request for
    information occurred in November 2003, and CMS Energy completed
    its response to this request in May 2004. CMS Energy is unable
    to predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation and what effect,
    if any, the investigation will have on its business. The CFTC
    filed a civil injunctive action against two former CMS Field
    Services employees in Oklahoma federal district court on
    February 1, 2005. The action alleged the two engaged in
    reporting false natural gas trade information, and sought to
    prohibit these acts, compel compliance with the Commodities
    Exchange Act, and impose monetary penalties. The court entered
    separate consent orders with respect to each of the two
    individuals, one dated April 18, 2007 and one dated
    June 25, 2007, resolving this litigation. The consent
    orders prohibit each of the individuals from engaging in certain
    activities and further provide civil monetary penalties in the
    amount of $100,000 for one individual and $25,000 for the other
    individual. Pursuant to agreements with each of the individuals,
    CMS Energy has paid $95,000 of the $100,000 amount and $22,000
    of the $25,000 amount, with the remaining amounts paid by the
    individuals themselves.

Gas Index Price Reporting Litigation:

CMS Energy,
    CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas, Inc. (the
    company that purchased CMS Field Services) and Cantera Gas
    Company are named as defendants in various lawsuits arising as a
    result of claimed inaccurate natural gas price reporting.
    Allegations include manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures
    and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies, and artificial
    inflation of natural gas retail prices in California, Colorado,
    Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. CMS MST has settled
    a master class action suit in California state court for
    $7 million. The CMS Energy defendants have also settled
    four class action suits originally filed in California federal
    court. The other cases in several state jurisdictions remain
    pending. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    these matters.

Katz Technology Litigation:

In June 2007, RAKTL
    filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the
    Eastern District of Michigan against CMS Energy and Consumers
    alleging patent infringement. RAKTL claimed that automated
    customer service, bill payment services and gas leak reporting
    offered to our customers and accessed through toll free numbers
    infringe on patents held by RAKTL. On January 15, 2008,
    Consumers and CMS Energy reached an agreement in principle with
    RAKTL to settle the litigation. We expect to finalize the terms
    of the settlement and license by late February 2008. We believe
    any settlement with RAKTL will be immaterial.

Bay Harbor:

As part of the development of Bay Harbor
    by certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy, pursuant to an agreement
    with the MDEQ, third parties constructed a golf course and park
    over several abandoned CKD piles, left over from the former
    cement plant operations on the Bay Harbor site. The third
    parties also undertook a series of remedial actions, including
    removing abandoned buildings and equipment; consolidating,
    shaping and covering CKD piles with soil and vegetation;
    removing CKD from streams and beaches; and constructing a
    leachate collection system at an identified seep. Leachate is
    formed when water passes through CKD. In 2002, CMS Energy sold
    its interest in Bay Harbor, but retained its obligations under
    environmental indemnifications entered into at the start of the
    project.

In September 2004, the MDEQ issued a notice of noncompliance
    after finding high-pH leachate in Lake Michigan adjacent to the
    property. The MDEQ also alleged higher than acceptable levels of
    heavy metals, including mercury, in the leachate flow.

In 2005, the EPA along with CMS Land and CMS Capital executed an
    AOC and approved a Removal Action Work Plan to address problems
    at Bay Harbor. Among other things, the plan called for the
    installation of collection trenches to capture high-pH leachate
    flow to the lake. Collection systems required under the plan
    have been installed and shoreline monitoring is ongoing. CMS
    Land and CMS Capital are required to address observed
    exceedances in pH, including required enhancements of the
    collection system. In May 2006, the EPA approved a pilot carbon
    dioxide enhancement plan to improve pH results in a specific
    area of the collection system. The

CMS-57

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

enhanced system was installed in June 2006. CMS Land and CMS
    Capital also engaged in other enhancements of the installed
    collection systems.

In November 2007, the EPA sent CMS Land and CMS Capital a letter
    identifying three separate areas representing approximately
    700 feet of shoreline in which the EPA claimed pH levels
    were unacceptable. The letter also took the position that CMS
    Land and CMS Capital are required to remedy the claimed
    noncompliance. CMS Land and CMS Capital submitted a formal
    objection to the EPA’s conclusions. In their objections,
    CMS Land and CMS Capital noted that the AOC did not require
    perfection and that over 97 percent of the measured pH
    levels were in the correct range. Further, the limited number of
    exceedances were not much above the pH nine level set by the AOC
    and posed no threat to the public health and safety. In
    addition, CMS Land and CMS Capital noted in their objection that
    the actions they had already taken fully complied with the terms
    of the AOC. In January 2008, the EPA advised CMS Land and CMS
    Capital that it had rejected their objections, and that CMS Land
    and CMS Capital were obligated to submit a plan to augment
    measures to collect high pH leachate under the terms of the
    November 2007 EPA letter as modified in the January 2008 letter.
    CMS Land and CMS Capital submitted a proposed augmentation plan
    in February 2008.

In February 2006, CMS Land and CMS Capital submitted to the EPA
    a proposed Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RIFS)
    for one of the CKD piles known as the East Park CKD pile. A
    similar RIFS is planned to be submitted for the remaining CKD
    piles in 2008. The EPA approved a schedule for near-term
    activities, which includes consolidating certain CKD materials
    and installing collection trenches in the East Park leachate
    release area. In June 2006, the EPA approved an East Park CKD
    Removal Action Work Plan and Final Engineering Design for
    Consolidation. However, the EPA has not approved the RIFS for
    the East Park.

As a result of the installation of collection systems at the Bay
    Harbor sites, CMS Land and CMS Capital are collecting and
    treating 135,000 gallons of liquid per day and shipping it by
    truck for disposal at a nearby well and at a municipal
    wastewater treatment plant located in Traverse City, Michigan.
    To address both short term and longer-term disposal of liquid,
    CMS Land has filed two permit applications with the MDEQ and the
    EPA, the first to treat the collected leachate at the Bay Harbor
    sites before releasing the water to Lake Michigan and the second
    to dispose of it in a deep injection well in Alba, Michigan,
    that CMS Land or its affiliate would own and operate. In
    February 2008, the MDEQ and the EPA granted permits for CMS Land
    or its affiliate to construct and operate a deep injection well
    near Alba, Michigan in eastern Antrim County. Certain
    environmental groups and a local township have indicated they
    may challenge these permits before the agencies or the courts.

CMS Land and CMS Capital, the MDEQ, and the EPA have ongoing
    discussions concerning the long-term remedy for the Bay Harbor
    sites. These negotiations are addressing, among other things,
    issues relating to the disposal of leachate, the location and
    design of collection lines and upstream diversion of water,
    potential flow of leachate below the collection system,
    applicable criteria for various substances such as mercury, and
    other matters that are likely to affect the scope of remedial
    work CMS Land and CMS Capital may be obliged to undertake.
    Negotiations have been ongoing for over a year, but CMS Land and
    CMS Capital have not been able to resolve these issues with the
    regulators and they remain pending.

CMS Land has entered into various access, purchase and
    settlement agreements with several of the affected landowners at
    Bay Harbor, and entered into a confidential settlement with one
    landowner to resolve a lawsuit filed by that landowner. We have
    received demands for indemnification relating to claims made by
    a property owner at Bay Harbor. CMS Land has purchased five
    unimproved lots and two lots with houses.

CMS Energy has recorded cumulative charges, including accretion
    expense, related to this matter of $140 million
    ($44 million of which was recorded in 2007). Several
    factors contributed to the need to revise remediation cost
    estimates in 2007. One of the major components of the revised
    remediation cost related to the disposal of collected liquid as
    discussed in preceding paragraphs. There has been a delay in the
    receipt of the Alba well permits from the schedule originally
    anticipated by CMS Land and CMS Capital, who also received an
    unfavorable response from the regulators concerning the plan to
    treat and release the leachate to Lake Michigan.

CMS-58

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Also, CMS Energy is recognizing a higher cost for operating and
    maintaining the existing collection system. In addition, CMS
    Land and CMS Capital have been unable to reach an agreement with
    the MDEQ and the EPA over the scope of necessary remedial work.
    Furthermore, the EPA’s issuance in November 2007 of its
    order requiring augmentation and accelerated actions regarding
    the high pH leachate recovery system caused CMS Land and CMS
    Capital to reconsider and modify their plans regarding the scope
    and schedule of the leachate collection systems and related
    shoreline work.

At December 31, 2007, CMS Energy has a recorded liability
    of $80 million for its remaining obligations. We calculated
    this liability based on discounted projected costs, using a
    discount rate of 4.45 percent and an inflation rate of
    1 percent on annual operating and maintenance costs. We
    used the interest rate for

30-year

U.S. Treasury securities for the discount rate. The
    undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is
    $94 million. We expect to pay $18 million in 2008,
    $16 million in 2009, $9 million in 2010 and in 2011,
    and the remaining expenditures as part of long-term liquid
    disposal and operating and maintenance costs. Any significant
    change in circumstances or assumptions, such as an increase in
    the number of sites, different remediation techniques, nature
    and extent of contamination, continued inability to reach
    agreement with the MDEQ or EPA over required remedial actions,
    delays in the receipt of requested permits, delays following the
    receipt of any requested permits due to legal appeals of third
    parties, additional or new legal or regulatory requirements, or
    new or different landowner claims, could impact our estimate of
    remedial action costs and the timing of the expenditures. An
    adverse outcome of this matter could, depending on the size of
    any indemnification obligation or liability under environmental
    laws, have a potentially significant adverse effect on CMS
    Energy’s financial condition and liquidity and could
    negatively impact CMS Energy’s financial results. CMS
    Energy cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this
    matter.

Consumers’
    Electric Utility Contingencies

Electric Environmental Matters:

Our operations are
    subject to environmental laws and regulations. Generally, we
    have been able to recover the costs to operate our facilities in
    compliance with these laws and regulations in customer rates.

Cleanup and Solid Waste:

Under the NREPA, we will
    ultimately incur investigation and response activity costs at a
    number of sites. We believe that these costs will be recoverable
    in rates under current ratemaking policies.

We are a potentially responsible party at a number of
    contaminated sites administered under the Superfund. Superfund
    liability is joint and several. However, many other creditworthy
    parties with substantial assets are potentially responsible with
    respect to the individual sites. Based on our experience, we
    estimate that our share of the total liability for most of our
    known Superfund sites will be between $1 million and
    $10 million. At December 31, 2007, we have recorded a
    liability for the minimum amount of our estimated probable
    Superfund liability in accordance with FIN 14.

The timing of payments related to our investigation and response
    activities at our Superfund and NREPA sites is uncertain. Any
    significant change in assumptions, such as different remediation
    techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and legal and
    regulatory requirements, could affect our estimate of response
    activity costs and the timing of our payments.

Ludington PCB:

In October 1998, during routine
    maintenance activities, we identified PCB as a component in
    certain paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington. We
    removed and replaced part of the PCB material with non-PCB
    material. Since proposing a plan to deal with the remaining
    materials, we have had several conversations with the EPA. The
    EPA has proposed a rule that would allow us to leave the
    material in place, subject to certain restrictions. We are not
    able to predict when the EPA will issue a final ruling. We
    cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Electric Utility Plant Air Permit Issues:

In April
    2007, we received a Notice of Violation (NOV) /Finding of
    Violation (FOV) from the EPA alleging that fourteen of our
    utility boilers exceeded visible emission limits in their
    associated air permits. The utility boilers are located at the
    D.E. Karn/J.C. Weadock Generating Complex, J.H.

CMS-59

CMS ENERGY

NOTES TO

Campbell Plant, B.C. Cobb Electric Generating Station and J.R.
    Whiting Plant, which are all located in Michigan. We have
    formally responded to the NOV/FOV denying the allegations and
    are awaiting the EPA’s response to our submission. We
    cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Litigation:

In 2003, a group of eight PURPA
    qualifying facilities (the plaintiffs) filed a lawsuit in Ingham
    County Circuit Court. The lawsuit alleged that we incorrectly
    calculated the energy charge payments made under power purchase
    agreements. The judge deferred to the primary jurisdiction of
    the MPSC, dismissing the circuit court case without prejudice.
    In February 2005, the MPSC issued an order in the 2004 PSCR plan
    case concluding that we have been correctly administering the
    energy charge calculation methodology. The plaintiffs have an
    appeal of the MPSC order pending with the Court of Appeals. We
    believe we have been performing the calculation in the manner
    prescribed by the power purchase agreements and have not
    recorded any reserves. We cannot predict the financial impact or
    outcome of this matter.

Consumers’
    Electric Utility Rate Matters

Electric ROA:

The Customer Choice Act allows
    electric utilities to recover their net Stranded Costs. In
    November 2004, the MPSC approved recovery of our Stranded Costs
    incurred from 2002 through 2003 plus interest through the period
    of collection. At December 31, 2007, we had a regulatory
    asset for Stranded Costs of $68 million. We collect these
    Stranded Costs through a surcharge on ROA customers. At
    December 31, 2007, alternative electric suppliers were
    providing 315 MW of generation service to ROA customers,
    which represents an increase of 5 percent of ROA load
    compared to December 31, 2006. However, since the MPSC
    order, we have experienced a downward trend in ROA customers.
    This trend has affected negatively our ability to recover these
    Stranded Costs in a timely manner. If this trend continues, it
    may require legislative or regulatory assistance to recover
    fully our 2002 and 2003 Stranded Costs.

Power Supply Costs:

The PSCR process allows recovery
    of reasonable and prudent power supply costs. The MPSC reviews
    these costs for reasonableness and prudency in annual plan
    proceedings and in plan reconciliation proceedings. The
    following table summarizes our PSCR reconciliation filings with
    the MPSC:

    excess sulfur dioxide allowances. In accordance with FERC
    regulations, we previously reserved these proceeds as a
    regulatory liability pending final direction on disposition of
    the proceeds from the MPSC.

2007 PSCR Plan:

In December 2006, the MPSC issued a
    temporary order allowing us to implement our 2007 PSCR monthly
    factor on January 1, 2007, as filed. The order also allowed
    us to include prior year underrecoveries and overrecoveries in
    future PSCR plans. In September 2007, the ALJ recommended in his
    Proposal for Decision that we reduce our underrecoveries to
    reflect the refund of all proceeds from the sale of sulfur
    dioxide allowances,

CMS-60

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

which totaled $62 million. Our PSCR plan proposed to refund
    50 percent of proceeds to customers. We reserved all
    proceeds, excluding interest, as a regulatory liability as
    discussed in the preceding paragraph.

2008 PSCR Plan

: In September 2007, we submitted our
    2008 PSCR plan filing to the MPSC. The plan proposed recovery of
    estimated 2007 PSCR underrecoveries of $84 million. We
    self-implemented a 2008 PSCR charge in January 2008.

We expect to recover fully all of our PSCR costs. When we
    are unable to collect these costs as they are incurred, there is
    a negative impact on our cash flows from electric utility
    operations. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    these proceedings.

Electric Rate Case:

In 2007, we filed applications
    with the MPSC seeking an 11.25 percent authorized return on
    equity and an annual increase in revenues of $269 million.
    We presently have an authorized return on equity of
    11.15 percent. In July 2007, we filed an amended
    application for rate relief, which seeks the following:

•

recovery of the purchase of the Zeeland power plant,

•

approval to remove the costs associated with Palisades,

•

approval of a plan for the distribution of additional excess
    proceeds from the sale of Palisades to customers, effectively
    offsetting the partial and immediate rate relief for up to nine
    months, and

•

partial and immediate rate relief associated with 2007 capital
    investments, a $400 million equity infusion into Consumers,
    and increased distribution system operation and maintenance
    costs including employee pension and health care costs.

In December 2007, the MPSC approved a rate increase of
    $70 million related to the purchase of the Zeeland power
    plant. The MPSC also stated that our interim request that sought
    the removal of costs associated with Palisades and the approval
    of a plan to distribute excess proceeds from the sale of
    Palisades to customers should be addressed in the final electric
    rate case order. Furthermore, the MPSC denied our request for
    the approval of partial and immediate rate relief associated
    with capital investments, changes in the capital structure, and
    increased operation and maintenance expenses.

When we are unable to include increased costs and investments in
    rates in a timely manner, there is a negative impact on our cash
    flows from electric utility operations. We cannot predict the
    financial impact or the outcome of this proceeding.

    operates the MCV Facility, contracted to sell 1,240 MW of
    electricity to Consumers under a

35-year

power purchase agreement that began in 1990. We estimate that
    capacity and energy payments under the MCV PPA, excluding RCP
    savings, will range from $650 million to $750 million
    annually, assuming successful exercise of the regulatory-out
    provision in the MCV PPA. We purchased capacity and energy, net
    of the MCV RCP replacement energy and benefits, under the MCV
    PPA of $464 million in 2007, $411 million in 2006, and
    $352 million in 2005.

Regulatory-out Provision in the MCV PPA:

Until we
    exercised the regulatory-out provision in the MCV PPA in
    September 2007, the cost that we incurred under the MCV PPA
    exceeded the recovery amount allowed by the MPSC. The
    regulatory-out provision limits our capacity and fixed energy
    payments to the MCV Partnership to the amounts that we collect
    from our customers. Cash underrecoveries of our capacity and
    fixed energy payments were $39 million in 2007. Savings
    from the RCP, after allocation of a portion to customers, offset
    some of our capacity and fixed energy underrecoveries expense.

As a result of our exercise of the regulatory-out provision, the
    MCV Partnership may, under certain circumstances, have the right
    to terminate the MCV PPA, or reduce the amount of capacity sold
    under the

CMS-61

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

MCV PPA from 1,240 MW to 806 MW, which could affect
    our electric Reserve Margin. The MCV Partnership has until
    February 25, 2008 to notify us of its intention to
    terminate the MCV PPA, at which time the MCV Partnership must
    specify the termination date. We have not yet received any
    notification of termination; however, the MCV Partnership has
    notified us that it disputes our right to exercise the
    regulatory-out provision. We believe that the provision is valid
    and fully effective and have not recorded any reserves, but we
    cannot predict whether we would prevail in the event of
    litigation on this issue.

We expect the MPSC to review our exercise of the regulatory-out
    provision and the likely consequences of such action. It is
    possible that in the event that the MCV Partnership terminates
    performance under the MCV PPA, prior orders could limit recovery
    of replacement power costs to the amounts that the MPSC
    authorized for recovery under the MCV PPA. Depending on the cost
    of replacement power, this could result in our costs exceeding
    the recovery amount allowed by the MPSC. We cannot predict the
    financial impact or outcome of these matters.

To comply with a prior MPSC order, we made a filing in May 2007
    with the MPSC requesting a determination as to whether it wished
    to reconsider the amount of the MCV PPA payments that we recover
    from customers. The MCV Partnership also filed an application
    with the MPSC requesting the elimination of the
    88.7 percent availability cap on the amount of capacity and
    fixed energy charges that we are allowed to recover from our
    customers. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    these matters.

Nuclear Matters:

Big Rock Decommissioning:

The MPSC and the FERC regulate the recovery of costs to
    decommission Big Rock. In December 2000, funding of the Big Rock
    trust fund stopped because the MPSC-authorized decommissioning
    surcharge collection period expired. The level of funds provided
    by the trust fell short of the amount needed to complete
    decommissioning. As a result, we provided $45 million of
    corporate contributions for decommissioning costs. This amount
    excludes the $30 million payment to Entergy to assume
    ownership and responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI and
    additional corporate contributions for nuclear fuel storage
    costs of $54 million, due to the DOE’s failure to
    accept spent nuclear fuel on schedule. We plan to seek recovery
    from the MPSC for decommissioning and other related expenditures
    and we have a $129 million regulatory asset recorded on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Cost:

We deferred payment for
    disposal of spent nuclear fuel burned before April 7, 1983.
    Our DOE liability is $159 million at December 31,
    2007. This amount includes interest, which is payable upon the
    first delivery of spent nuclear fuel to the DOE. We recovered,
    through electric rates, the amount of this liability, excluding
    a portion of interest. In conjunction with the sale of Palisades
    and the Big Rock ISFSI, we retained this obligation and provided
    a $155 million letter of credit to Entergy as security for
    this obligation.

DOE Litigation:

In 1997, a U.S. Court of
    Appeals decision confirmed that the DOE was to begin accepting
    deliveries of spent nuclear fuel for disposal by January 1998.
    Subsequent U.S. Court of Appeals litigation, in which we
    and other utilities participated, has not been successful in
    producing more specific relief for the DOE’s failure to
    accept the spent nuclear fuel.

A number of court decisions support the right of utilities to
    pursue damage claims in the United States Court of Claims
    against the DOE for failure to take delivery of spent nuclear
    fuel. We filed our complaint in December 2002. If our litigation
    against the DOE is successful, we plan to use any recoveries as
    reimbursement for the incurred costs of spent nuclear fuel
    storage during our ownership of Palisades and Big Rock. We
    cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.
    The sale of Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI did not transfer
    the right to any recoveries from the DOE related to costs of
    spent nuclear fuel storage incurred during our ownership of
    Palisades and Big Rock.

Consumers’
    Gas Utility Contingencies

Gas Environmental Matters:

We expect to incur
    investigation and remediation costs at a number of sites under
    the Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act,
    a Michigan statute that covers environmental activities
    including remediation. These sites include 23 former
    manufactured gas plant facilities.

CMS-62

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

We operated the facilities on these sites for some part of their
    operating lives. For some of these sites, we have no current
    ownership or may own only a portion of the original site. In
    December 2005, we estimated our remaining costs to be between
    $29 million and $71 million, based on 2005 discounted
    costs, using a discount rate of three percent. The discount rate
    represented a

10-year

average of U.S. Treasury bond rates reduced for increases
    in the consumer price index. We expect to fund most of these
    costs through proceeds from insurance settlements and
    MPSC-approved rates.

From January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2007, we spent a
    total of $12 million for MGP response activities. At
    December 31, 2007, we have a liability of $17 million
    and a regulatory asset of $50 million, which includes
    $33 million of deferred MGP expenditures. The timing of
    payments related to the remediation of our manufactured gas
    plant sites is uncertain. Annual response activity costs are
    expected to range between $4 million and $6 million
    per year over the next five years. Any significant change in
    assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites,
    different remediation techniques, nature and extent of
    contamination, and legal and regulatory requirements, could
    affect our estimate of response activity costs and the timing of
    our payments.

Gas Title Transfer Tracking Fees and
    Services:

In November 2007, we reached an agreement in
    principle with Duke Energy Corporation, Dynegy Incorporated,
    Reliant Energy Resources Incorporated and FERC Staff to settle
    the TTT proceeding. The terms of the agreement include the
    payment of $2 million in total refunds to all TTT customers
    and a reduced rate for future TTT transactions.

FERC Investigation:

In February 2008, Consumers
    received a data request relating to an investigation the FERC is
    conducting into possible violations of the FERC’s posting
    and competitive bidding regulations related to releases of firm
    capacity on natural gas pipelines. Consumers will cooperate with
    the FERC in responding to the request. Consumers cannot predict
    the financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Gas Cost Recovery:

The GCR process is designed to
    allow us to recover all of our purchased natural gas costs if
    incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.
    The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices for
    prudency in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings.

2005-2006

GCR Plan year. The order approved a settlement agreement and
    established a fixed price cap of $10.10 per mcf for December
    2005 through March 2006. We were able to maintain our GCR
    billing factor below the authorized level for that period. The
    order was appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals by one
    intervenor. In January 2008, the Michigan Court of Appeals
    affirmed the MPSC’s order for our

2005-2006

GCR Plan year. The order approved a settlement agreement that
    allowed a base GCR ceiling factor of $9.48 per mcf for April
    2006 through March 2007. We were able to maintain our GCR
    billing factor below the authorized level for that period.

GCR plan for year

2007-2008:

In
    July 2007, the MPSC issued an order for our

GCR plan year. The order approved a settlement agreement that
    allowed a base GCR ceiling factor of $8.47 per mcf for April
    2007 through March 2008, subject to a quarterly ceiling price
    adjustment mechanism. To date, we have been able to maintain our
    GCR billing factor below the authorized level.

The GCR billing factor is adjusted monthly in order to minimize
    the over or underrecovery amounts in our annual GCR
    reconciliation. Our GCR billing factor for February 2008 is
    $7.69 per mcf.

GCR plan for year

2008-2009:

In
    December 2007, we filed an application with the MPSC seeking
    approval of a GCR plan for our

2008-2009

    consisting of:

•

a base GCR ceiling factor of $8.17 per mcf, plus

•

a quarterly GCR ceiling price adjustment contingent upon future
    events.

2007 Gas Rate Case:

In February 2007, we filed an
    application with the MPSC seeking an 11.25 percent
    authorized return on equity as part of an $88 million
    annual increase in our gas delivery and transportation rates. In
    August 2007, the MPSC approved a partial settlement agreement
    authorizing an annual rate increase of $50 million,
    including an authorized return on equity of 10.75 percent.
    In September  2007, the MPSC reopened the record in the
    case to allow all interested parties to be heard concerning the
    approval of an energy efficiency program, which we proposed in
    our original filing. Hearings on this matter were held in
    February 2008. We expect the MPSC to issue a final order in the
    second quarter of 2008. If approved in total, this would result
    in an additional rate increase of $9 million for
    implementation of the energy efficiency program.

2008 Gas Rate Case:

In February 2008, we filed an
    application with the MPSC for an annual gas rate increase of
    $91 million and an 11 percent authorized return on
    equity.

Other
    Contingencies

Argentina:

As part of its energy privatization
    incentives, the Republic of Argentina (Argentina) directed CMS
    Gas Transmission to calculate tariffs in U.S. dollars, then
    convert them to pesos at the prevailing exchange rate, and to
    adjust tariffs every six months to reflect changes in inflation.
    Starting in early 2000, Argentina suspended the inflation
    adjustments.

In January 2002, the Republic of Argentina enacted the Public
    Emergency and Foreign Exchange System Reform Act. This law
    repealed the fixed exchange rate of one U.S. dollar to one
    Argentine peso, converted all dollar-denominated utility tariffs
    and energy contract obligations into pesos at the same
    one-to-one exchange rate, and directed the Government of
    Argentina to renegotiate such tariffs.

CMS Gas Transmission began arbitration proceedings against
    Argentina under the auspices of the ICSID in mid-2001, citing
    breaches by Argentina of the Argentine-U.S. Bilateral
    Investment Treaty. In May 2005, an ICSID tribunal concluded,
    among other things, that Argentina’s economic emergency did
    not excuse Argentina from liability for violations of the BIT.
    The ICSID tribunal found in favor of CMS Gas Transmission, and
    awarded damages of U.S. $133 million, plus interest.

The ICSID Convention provides that either party may seek
    annulment of the award based upon five possible grounds
    specified in the ICSID Convention. ICSID formally registered
    Argentina’s Application for Annulment in September 2005. In
    December 2005, certain insurance underwriters paid
    $75 million to CMS Gas Transmission in respect of their
    insurance obligations resulting from non-payment of the ICSID
    arbitration award. We recorded this payment as a deferred credit
    on our Consolidated Balance Sheets because of a contingent
    obligation to refund the proceeds if the arbitration decision
    was annulled. In March 2007, we sold our Argentine businesses
    and the rights to

receive any proceeds from the ICSID award and certain claims
    against political risk insurance to Lucid Energy for
    $130 million. Under the sale, we retained the rights to
    $75 million in proceeds previously received from political
    risk insurance insurers.

In September 2007, the contingent repayment obligation was
    eliminated by agreement. Later that month, a separate
    arbitration panel ruling on the annulment issue upheld the prior
    ICSID award. As a result, we recognized the $75 million
    deferred credit in Asset impairment charges, net of insurance
    recoveries on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). For
    more information on the sale of our Argentine assets to Lucid
    Energy, see Note 2, Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations
    and Impairment Charges, “Asset Sales.”

Quicksilver Resources, Inc.:

Quicksilver sued CMS MST for
    breach of contract in connection with a base contract for sale
    and purchase of natural gas. The contract outlines
    Quicksilver’s agreement to sell, and CMS MST’s
    agreement to buy, natural gas. Quicksilver believes that it is
    entitled to more payments for natural gas than it has received.
    CMS MST disagrees with Quicksilver’s analysis and believes
    that it has paid all amounts owed for delivery of gas according
    to the contract. Quicksilver was seeking damages of up to
    approximately $126 million, plus prejudgment interest and
    attorney fees.

The trial commenced on March 19, 2007. The jury verdict
    awarded Quicksilver zero compensatory damages but
    $10 million in punitive damages. The jury found that CMS
    MST breached the contract and committed fraud but found no
    actual damage related to such a claim.

On May 15, 2007, the trial court vacated the jury award of
    punitive damages but held that the contract should be rescinded
    prospectively. The judicial rescission of the contract caused
    CMS Energy to record a charge in the second quarter of 2007 of
    approximately $24 million, net of tax. To preserve its
    appellate rights, CMS MST filed a motion to modify, correct or
    reform the judgment and a motion for a judgment contrary to the
    jury verdict with the trial court. The trial court dismissed
    these motions. CMS MST has filed a notice of appeal with the
    Texas Court of Appeals. Quicksilver has filed a notice of cross
    appeal.

Star Energy:

In 2000, a Michigan trial judge granted
    Star Energy, Inc. and White Pine Enterprises, LLC a judgment in
    an action filed in 1999 that claimed Terra Energy Ltd., a former
    CMS Oil and Gas subsidiary, violated an oil and gas lease and
    other arrangements by failing to drill wells it had committed to
    drill. A jury then awarded the plaintiffs an $8 million
    award. The Court of Appeals reversed the damages award and
    granted Terra Energy Ltd. a new trial on damages only. The trial
    was set for August 2007, but the parties reached a settlement
    before trial. As a result, CMS Energy recorded a charge in the
    second quarter of 2007 of $3 million, net of tax.

T.E.S. Filer City Air Permit Issue:

In January 2007,
    we received a Notice of Violation from the EPA alleging that
    T.E.S. Filer City, a generating facility in which we have a
    50 percent partnership interest, exceeded certain air
    permit limits. The EPA recently issued a notice levying a
    penalty of $0.1 million. We cannot predict the financial
    impact or outcome of this issue.

Equatorial Guinea Tax Claim:

In 2004, we received a
    request for indemnification from the purchaser of CMS Oil and
    Gas. The indemnification claim relates to the sale of our oil,
    gas and methanol projects in Equatorial Guinea and the claim of
    the government of Equatorial Guinea that we owe it
    $142 million in taxes in connection with that sale. CMS
    Energy and its tax advisors concluded that the government’s
    tax claim is without merit and the purchaser of CMS Oil and Gas
    submitted a response to the government rejecting the claim. The
    Equatorial Guinea government still intends to pursue its claim.
    We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Moroccan Tax Claim:

In February 2007, CMS Energy
    sold its interest in Jorf Lasfar. As part of the sale, CMS
    Energy agreed to indemnify the purchaser for any tax assessments
    attributable to tax years prior to the sale. In December 2007,
    the Moroccan government concluded its audit of JLEC for tax
    years 2002 through 2005 for which the government has presented
    its preliminary findings but not yet issued an assessment. CMS
    Energy is participating in discussions with the Moroccan tax
    authorities but at this time cannot predict the financial impact
    or outcome of this matter.

CMS ERM Electricity Sales Agreements:

CMS ERM was a
    party to three electricity sales agreements, under which it
    provided up to 300 MW of electricity at fixed prices. CMS
    ERM satisfied its obligations under these agreements by using
    electricity generated by DIG or by purchasing electricity from
    the market. Because the price of natural gas has increased
    substantially in recent years, the prices that were charged
    under these agreements did not reflect DIG’s cost to
    generate or CMS ERM’s cost to purchase electricity from the
    market. Therefore, these agreements negatively impacted
    DIG’s and CMS ERM’s financial performance.

In November 2007, CMS ERM, DIG, and CMS Energy reached an
    agreement to terminate two of these electricity sales agreements
    in order to eliminate future losses under those contracts. As
    consideration for agreeing to terminate the agreements, CMS ERM
    paid the customers $275 million upon closing the
    transaction in February 2008. We recorded a liability for the
    future payment and other termination costs and recognized a loss
    of $279 million in 2007, representing the cost to terminate
    the agreements. As a result of terminating these agreements, CMS
    ERM and DIG have reduced their long-term electric capacity
    supply obligations by 260 MW. CMS ERM will market the
    capacity and energy that was previously committed under these
    agreements into the merchant market either through third party
    agreements or directly with the MISO.

Also in November 2007, CMS ERM executed an amendment of the
    remaining electricity sales agreement, which was effective upon
    the closing of the transaction. The purpose of the amendment is
    to optimize production planning and ensure optimal use of
    available resources. The amendment establishes a minimum amount
    of contract capacity to be provided under the agreement, and
    adds a minimum and maximum amount of electricity to be delivered
    to the customer. As amended, this electricity sales agreement is
    a derivative instrument. Upon signing the amendment in 2007, we
    recorded our minimum obligation under the contract on our
    consolidated balance sheet at its fair value and recognized the
    resulting mark-to-market loss of $18 million in earnings.
    For additional details on accounting for this derivative, see
    Note 6, Financial and Derivative Instruments.

(a)

The majority of this amount arises from provisions in stock and
    asset sales agreements under which we indemnify the purchaser
    for losses resulting from claims related to tax disputes, claims
    related to power purchase agreements and the failure of title to
    the assets or stock sold by us to the purchaser. As of
    December 31, 2007, we have an $88 million liability in
    connection with indemnities related to the sale of certain
    subsidiaries. We believe the likelihood of loss for the
    remaining indemnifications to be remote.

(b)

Maximum obligation includes $85 million related to the MCV
    Partnership’s non-performance under a steam and electric
    power agreement with Dow. We sold our interests in the MCV
    Partnership and the FMLP. The sales agreement calls for the
    purchaser, an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners and Rockland
    Capital Energy Investments, to pay $85 million, subject to
    certain reimbursement rights, if Dow terminates an agreement
    under which the MCV Partnership provides it steam and electric
    power. This agreement expires in March 2016, subject to certain
    terms and conditions. The purchaser secured its reimbursement
    obligation with an irrevocable letter of credit of up to
    $85 million.

    Energy are parties to certain lawsuits and administrative
    proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies
    arising from the ordinary course of business. These lawsuits and
    proceedings may involve personal injury, property damage,
    contractual matters, environmental issues, federal and state
    taxes, rates, licensing, and other matters.

We have accrued estimated losses for certain contingencies
    discussed within this Note. Resolution of these contingencies is
    not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial

First Mortgage Bonds:

Consumers secures its FMBs by
    a mortgage and lien on substantially all of its property. Its
    ability to issue FMBs is restricted by certain provisions in the
    first mortgage bond indenture and the need for regulatory
    approvals under federal law. Restrictive issuance provisions in
    the first mortgage bond indenture include achieving a two-times
    interest coverage ratio and having sufficient unfunded net
    property additions.

Securitization Bonds:

Certain regulatory assets
    collateralize securitization bonds. The bondholders have no
    recourse to our other assets. Through Consumers’ rate
    structure, we bill customers for securitization surcharges to
    fund the payment of principal, interest, and other related
    expenses. The surcharges collected are remitted to a trustee and
    are not available to creditors of Consumers or creditors of its
    affiliates. Securitization surcharges totaled $48 million
    in 2007 and $50 million in 2006.

Long-Term Debt — Related Parties:

CMS
    Energy formed a statutory wholly-owned business trust for the
    sole purpose of issuing preferred securities and lending the
    gross proceeds to itself. The sole assets of the trust consists
    of the debentures described in the following table. These
    debentures have terms similar to those of the mandatorily
    redeemable preferred securities the trust issued. We determined
    that we do not hold the controlling financial interest in our
    trust preferred security structure. Accordingly, this entity is
    reflected in Long-term debt — related parties on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Dividend Restrictions:

Under provisions of our

    common stock dividends was limited to $363 million.

Under the provisions of its articles of incorporation, at
    December 31, 2007, Consumers had $269 million of
    unrestricted retained earnings available to pay common stock
    dividends. Provisions of the Federal Power Act and the Natural
    Gas Act effectively restrict dividends to the amount of
    Consumers’ retained earnings. For the year ended

    receivable to a wholly owned, consolidated, bankruptcy-remote
    special-purpose entity. In turn, the special purpose entity may
    sell an undivided interest in up to $325 million of the
    receivables. The special purpose entity sold no receivables at
    December 31, 2007 and $325 million at
    December 31, 2006. The purchaser of the receivables has no
    recourse against our other assets for failure of a debtor to pay
    when due and no right to any receivables not sold. We have
    neither recorded a gain or loss on the receivables sold nor
    retained interest in the receivables sold. We continue to

On or after December 5, 2008, we will have the right to
    cause the 4.50 percent preferred stock to be converted if
    the closing price of our common stock remains at or above $12.71
    for 20 of any 30 consecutive trading days. The holders of the
    3.375 percent senior notes have the right to require us to
    purchase the notes at par on July 15, 2008, 2013, and 2018.
    The holders of the 2.875 percent senior notes have the
    right to require us to purchase the notes at par on
    December 1, 2011, 2014, and 2019.

The securities become convertible for a calendar quarter if the
    price of our common stock remains at or above the trigger price
    for 20 of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the previous quarter. The trigger price at which these
    securities become convertible is 120 percent of the
    conversion price. The conversion and trigger prices are subject
    to adjustment under certain circumstances, including payments or
    distributions to our common stockholders. The conversion and
    trigger price adjustment is made when the cumulative change in
    conversion and trigger prices is one percent or more.

All of our contingently convertible securities, if converted,
    require us to pay cash up to the principal (or par) amount of
    the securities. Any conversion value in excess of that amount is
    paid in shares of our common stock.

During December 2007, the trigger price contingency was met for
    our 4.50 percent preferred stock and our 3.375 percent
    senior notes. As a result, these securities are convertible at
    the option of the security holders during the three months ended
    March 31, 2008. In December 2007, one security holder
    notified us of its intention to convert 2,000 shares of
    4.50 percent preferred stock. As of February 2008, no other
    security holders have notified us of their intention to convert
    these securities.

The 3.375 percent senior notes are convertible on demand
    and are classified as current liabilities.

operations, our contingently convertible securities dilute EPS
    to the extent that the conversion value, which is based on the
    average market price of our common stock, exceeds the principal
    or par value. Had there been positive income from continuing
    operations, our contingently convertible securities would have
    contributed an additional 19.7 million shares to the
    calculation of diluted EPS for 2007, 11.3 million shares
    for 2006, and 10.9 million shares for 2005. For additional
    details on our contingently convertible securities, see
    Note 4, Financings and Capitalization.

Stock Options, Warrants and Restricted Stock:

For
    the year ended December 31, 2007, there was no impact on
    diluted EPS from 1.1 million shares of unvested restricted
    stock awards or from options and warrants to purchase
    0.3 million shares of common stock. Since the exercise
    price was greater than the average market price of our common
    stock, there was no impact to diluted EPS from additional
    options and warrants to purchase 0.7 million shares of
    common stock. These stock options have the potential to dilute
    EPS in the future.

Convertible Debentures:

For the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, there was no impact on
    diluted EPS from our 7.75 percent convertible subordinated
    debentures. Using the if-converted method, the debentures would
    have:

•

increased the numerator of diluted EPS by $9 million from
    an assumed reduction of interest expense, net of tax, and

•

increased the denominator of diluted EPS by 4.2 million
    shares.

We can revoke the conversion rights if certain conditions are
    met.

During 2007, the proceeds from sales of SERP securities were

    reclassified from AOCL and included in net loss. The proceeds
    from sales of SERP securities were $6 million during 2006
    and $3 million during 2005. Gross gains and losses were
    immaterial in 2006 and 2005.

Derivative Instruments:

In order to limit our
    exposure to certain market risks, we may enter into various risk
    management contracts, such as swaps, options, futures, and
    forward contracts. These contracts, used primarily to limit our
    exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices, are
    classified as either non-trading or trading. We enter into these
    contracts using established policies and procedures, under the
    direction of two different committees: an executive oversight
    committee consisting of senior management representatives and a
    risk committee consisting of business unit managers.

The contracts we use to manage market risks may qualify as
    derivative instruments that are subject to derivative and hedge
    accounting under SFAS No. 133. If a contract is a
    derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and
    sales exception under SFAS No. 133, it is recorded on
    our consolidated balance sheet at its fair value. Each quarter,
    we adjust the resulting asset or liability to reflect any change
    in the fair value of the contract, a practice known as marking
    the contract to market. If a derivative qualifies for cash flow
    hedge accounting treatment, we report changes in its fair value
    (gains or losses) in AOCL; otherwise, we report the gains and
    losses in earnings.

For a derivative instrument to qualify for cash flow hedge
    accounting:

•

the relationship between the derivative instrument and the
    forecasted transaction being hedged must be formally documented
    at inception,

•

the derivative instrument must be highly effective in offsetting
    the hedged transaction’s cash flows, and

•

the forecasted transaction being hedged must be probable.

If a derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting
    treatment and gains or losses are recorded in AOCL, those gains
    or losses will be reclassified into earnings in the same period
    or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
    If a cash flow hedge is terminated early because it is
    determined that the forecasted transaction will not occur, any
    gain or loss recorded in AOCL at that date is recognized
    immediately in earnings. If a cash flow hedge is terminated
    early for other economic reasons, any gain or loss as of the
    termination date is deferred and then reclassified to earnings
    when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The
    ineffective portion, if any, of all hedges is recognized in
    earnings.

To determine the fair value of our derivatives, we use
    information from external sources, such as quoted market prices
    and other valuation information. For certain contracts, this
    information is not available and we use mathematical models to
    value our derivatives. These models use various inputs and
    assumptions, including commodity market prices and volatilities,
    as well as interest rates and contract maturity dates. The cash
    returns we actually realize on these contracts may be different
    from the results that we estimate using models. If necessary,
    our calculations of fair value include reserves to reflect the
    credit risk of our counterparties.

CMS-74

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Most of our commodity purchase and sale contracts are not
    subject to derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133
    because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units
    specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity
    or bcf of natural gas),

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales
    exception, or

•

there is not an active market for the commodity.

Our coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is
    not an active market for the coal we purchase. If an active
    market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts
    may qualify as derivatives. For Consumers, which is subject to
    regulatory accounting, the resulting mark-to-market gains and
    losses would be offset by changes in regulatory assets and
    liabilities and would not affect net income. For other CMS
    Energy subsidiaries, the resulting mark-to-market impact on
    earnings could be material.

NOTES TO

CMS ERM Contracts:

In order to support CMS
    Energy’s ongoing operations, CMS ERM enters into contracts
    to purchase and sell electricity and natural gas in the future.
    These forward contracts will result in physical delivery of the
    commodity at a contracted price. These contracts are generally
    long-term in nature and are classified as non-trading contracts.

To manage commodity price risks associated with these forward
    purchase and sale contracts, CMS ERM uses various financial
    instruments, such as swaps, options, and futures. CMS ERM also
    uses these types of instruments to manage commodity price risk
    associated with generation assets owned by CMS Energy and its
    subsidiaries. These financial contracts are classified as
    trading contracts.

Changes in the fair value of CMS ERM’s non-trading and
    trading contracts are recorded in earnings as a component of
    Operating Revenue. For trading contracts, these gains and losses
    are recorded net in accordance with EITF Issue

02-03.

Derivative Contracts Associated with Equity Investments:

In May 2007, we sold our ownership interest in businesses in
    the Middle East, Africa, and India. Certain of these businesses
    held interest rate contracts and foreign exchange contracts that
    were derivatives. Before the sale, we recorded our share of the
    change in fair value of these contracts in AOCL if the contracts
    qualified for cash flow hedge accounting; otherwise, we recorded
    our share in Earnings from Equity Method Investees.

At the date of the sale, we had accumulated a net loss of
    $13 million, net of tax, in AOCL representing our share of
    mark-to-market gains and losses from cash flow hedges held by
    the equity method investees. After the sale, we reclassified
    this amount and recognized it in earnings as a reduction of the
    gain on the sale. For additional details on the sale of our
    interest in these equity method investees, see Note 2,
    Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations and Impairment Charges.

Credit Risk:

Our swaps, options, and forward
    contracts contain credit risk, which is the risk that our
    counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations.
    We reduce this risk through established credit policies. For
    each counterparty, we assess credit quality by considering
    credit ratings, financial condition, and other available
    information. We then establish a credit limit for each
    counterparty based upon our evaluation of its credit quality. We
    monitor our exposure to potential loss under each contract and
    take action, if necessary.

CMS ERM enters into contracts primarily with companies in the
    electric and gas industry. This industry concentration may have
    a positive or negative impact on our exposure to credit risk
    based on how these counterparties are affected by similar
    changes in economic conditions, the weather, or other
    conditions. CMS ERM reduces its credit risk exposure by using
    industry-standard agreements that allow for netting positive and
    negative exposures associated with the same counterparty.
    Typically, these agreements also allow each party to demand
    adequate assurance of future performance from the other party,
    when there is reason to do so.

The following table illustrates our exposure to potential losses
    at December 31, 2007, if each counterparty within this
    industry concentration failed to meet its contractual
    obligations. This table includes contracts accounted for as
    financial instruments. It does not include trade accounts
    receivable, derivative contracts that qualify for the normal
    purchases and sales exception under SFAS No. 133, or
    other contracts that are not accounted for as derivatives.

Pension Plan:

The Pension Plan includes funds for
    most of our current employees, the employees of our
    subsidiaries, and Panhandle, a former subsidiary. The Pension
    Plan’s assets are not distinguishable by company.

In April 2007, we sold Palisades to Entergy. Employees
    transferred to Entergy as a result of the sale no longer
    participate in our retirement benefit plans. We recorded a net
    decrease of $16 million in pension SFAS No. 158
    regulatory assets with a corresponding reduction of
    $16 million in pension liabilities on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. We also recorded a net decrease of
    $15 million in OPEB regulatory SFAS No. 158
    assets with a corresponding reduction of $15 million in
    OPEB liabilities. The following table shows the net adjustment:

On September 1, 2005, we implemented the DCCP. The DCCP
    provides an employer contribution of 5 percent of base pay
    to the existing employees’ 401(k) plan. No employee
    contribution is required in order to receive the plan’s
    employer contribution. All employees hired on and after
    September 1, 2005 participate in this plan. Cash balance
    pension plan participants also participate in the DCCP as of
    September 1, 2005. Additional pay credits under the cash
    balance pension plan were discontinued as of that date. The DCCP
    expense was $2 million for each of the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006.

SERP:

SERP benefits are paid from a trust
    established in 1988. SERP is not a qualified plan under the
    Internal Revenue Code. SERP trust earnings are taxable and trust
    assets are included in our consolidated assets. Trust assets
    were $95 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $71 million at December 31, 2006. The assets are
    classified as Other non-current assets on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The ABO for SERP was $83 million at
    December 31, 2007 and $78 million at December 31,
    2006. A contribution of $25 million was made to the trust
    in December 2007.

On April 1, 2006, we implemented a DC SERP and froze
    further new participation in the defined benefit SERP. The DC
    SERP provides participants benefits ranging from 5 percent
    to 15 percent of total compensation. The DC SERP requires a
    minimum of five years of participation before vesting. Our
    contributions to the plan, if any, will be

placed in a grantor trust. Trust assets were less than
    $1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006. The assets
    are classified as Other non-current assets on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The DC SERP expense was less than
    $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006.

401(k):

The employer’s match for the 401(k) savings
    plan is 60 percent on eligible contributions up to the
    first six percent of an employee’s wages. The total 401(k)
    savings plan cost was $14 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 and $15 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Beginning May 1, 2007, the CMS Energy Common Stock Fund was
    no longer an investment option available for investments in the
    401(k) savings plan and the employer match was no longer in CMS
    Energy Common Stock. Participants had an opportunity to
    reallocate investments in the CMS Energy Common Stock Fund to
    other plan investment alternatives prior to November 1,
    2007. In November 2007, the remaining shares in the CMS Energy
    Common Stock Fund were sold and the sale proceeds were
    reallocated to other plan investment options.

EISP:

We implemented a nonqualified EISP in 2002 to
    provide flexibility in separation of employment by officers, a
    selected group of management, or other highly compensated
    employees. Terms of the plan may include payment of a lump sum,
    payment of monthly benefits for life, payment of premiums for
    continuation of health care, or any other legally permissible
    term deemed to be in our best interest to offer. The EISP
    expense was $1 million for each of the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006. The ABO for the EISP was
    $4 million at December 31, 2007 and $5 million at
    December 31, 2006.

OPEB:

The OPEB plan covers all regular full-time
    employees who are covered by the employee health care plan on a
    company-subsidized basis the day before they retire from the
    company at age 55 or older and who have at least 10 full
    years of applicable continuous service. Regular full-time
    employees who qualify for a pension plan disability retirement
    and have 15 years of applicable continuous service are also
    eligible. Starting in 2007, we used two health care trend rates:
    one for retirees under 65 and the other for retirees 65 and
    over. The two health care trend rates recognize that
    prescription drug costs are increasing at a faster pace than
    other medical claim costs and that prescription drug costs make
    up a larger portion of expenses for retirees age 65 and
    over. Retiree health care costs were based on the assumption
    that costs would increase 9.0 percent for those under 65
    and 10.5 percent for those over 65 in 2007. The 2008 rate
    of increase for OPEB health costs for those under 65 is expected
    to be 8.0 percent and for those over 65 is expected to be
    9.5 percent. The rate of increase is expected to slow to
    5 percent for those under 65 by 2011 and for those over 65
    by 2013 and thereafter.

The health care cost trend rate assumption affects the estimated
    costs recorded. A one percentage point change in the assumed
    health care cost trend assumption would have the following
    effects:

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 106, at the beginning of
    1992, we recorded a liability of $466 million for the
    accumulated transition obligation and a corresponding regulatory
    asset for anticipated recovery in utility rates. For additional
    details, see Note 1, Corporate Structure and Accounting
    Policies, “Utility Regulation.” The MPSC authorized
    recovery of the electric utility portion of these costs in 1994
    over 18 years and the gas utility portion in 1996 over
    16 years.

SFAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R):

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 158. This standard requires us to recognize
    the funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006.
    SFAS No. 158 also requires us to recognize changes in
    the funded status of our plans in the year in which the changes
    occur. In addition, the standard requires that we change our
    plan measurement date from November 30 to December 31,
    effective December 31, 2008. We do not believe

(a)

Regulatory adjustments are the differences between amounts
    included in rates and the periodic benefit cost calculated
    pursuant to SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106.
    These adjustments are deferred as a regulatory asset and will be
    included in future rate cases. The pension regulatory asset had
    a balance of $33 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $11 million at December 31, 2006. The OPEB regulatory
    asset had a balance of $8 million at December 31, 2007
    and $2 million at December 31, 2006.

The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined
    benefit pension plans that will be amortized into net periodic
    benefit cost over the next fiscal year from the regulatory asset
    is $43 million and from AOCL is $2 million. The
    estimated net loss and prior service credit for OPEB plans that
    will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the next
    fiscal year from the regulatory asset is zero and from AOCL is
    $1 million.

We amortize gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the
    greater of the benefit obligation and the MRV over the average
    remaining service period. The estimated time of amortization of
    gains and losses is 13 years for pension and 14 years
    for OPEB. Prior service cost amortization is established in the
    years in which they first occur, and are based on the same
    amortization period in all future years until fully recognized.
    The estimated time of amortization of new prior service costs is
    13 years for pension and 11 years for OPEB.

We contributed $50 million to our OPEB plan in 2007 and we
    plan to contribute $49 million to our OPEB plan in 2008. Of
    the $50 million OPEB contribution during 2007,
    $25 million was contributed to the 401(h) component of the
    qualified pension plan and the remaining $25 million was
    contributed to the VEBA trust accounts. We contributed
    $109 million to our Pension Plan in 2007 and we do not plan
    to contribute to our Pension Plan in 2008.

We established a target asset allocation for our Pension Plan
    assets of 60 percent equity, 30 percent fixed income,
    and 10 percent alternative strategy investments to maximize
    the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent
    level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the
    liabilities of the plan. Equity investments are diversified
    mostly across the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
    with lesser allocations to the Standard & Poor’s
    Mid Cap and Small Cap Indexes and Foreign Equity Funds.
    Fixed-income investments are diversified across investment grade
    instruments of both government and corporate issuers as well as
    high-yield and global bond funds. Alternative strategies are
    diversified across absolute return investment approaches and
    global tactical asset allocation. We use annual liability
    measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic
    asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to
    the portfolio allocation.

We established union and non-union VEBA trusts to fund our
    future retiree health and life insurance benefits. These trusts
    are funded through the ratemaking process for Consumers, and
    through direct contributions from the non-utility subsidiaries.
    We invest the equity portions of the union and non-union health
    care VEBA trusts in a Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
    fund. We invest the fixed-income portion of the union health
    care VEBA trust in domestic investment grade taxable
    instruments. We invest the fixed-income portion of the non-union
    health care VEBA trust in a diversified mix of domestic
    tax-exempt securities. The investment selections of each VEBA
    trust are influenced by the tax consequences, as well as the
    objective of generating asset returns that will meet the medical
    and life insurance costs of retirees.

8: ASSET
    RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations

:

This standard requires us to record the
    fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their
    useful lives, if there is a legal obligation to remove them. No
    market risk premium was included in our ARO fair value estimate
    since a reasonable estimate could not be made. If a five percent
    market risk premium were assumed, our ARO liability at
    December 31, 2007 would increase by $10 million.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the
    period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with
    indeterminate lives, the liability is to be recognized when a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Historically, our
    gas transmission and electric and gas distribution assets have
    indeterminate lives and retirement cash flows that cannot be
    determined. During 2007, however, we implemented a new fixed
    asset accounting system that facilitates ARO accounting
    estimates for gas distribution mains and services. The new
    system enabled us to calculate a reasonable estimate of the fair
    value of the cost to cut, purge, and cap abandoned gas
    distribution mains and services at the end of their useful
    lives. We recorded a $101 million ARO liability and an
    asset of equal value at December 31, 2007. We have not
    recorded a liability for assets that have insignificant
    cumulative disposal costs, such as substation batteries.

FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations:

This
    Interpretation clarified the term “conditional asset
    retirement obligation” used in SFAS No. 143. The
    term refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement
    activity in which the timing or method of settlement are
    conditional on a future event. We determined that abatement of
    asbestos included in our plant investments and the cut, purge,
    and cap of abandoned gas distribution mains and services qualify
    as conditional AROs, as defined by FIN 47.

April 2007, we sold Palisades to Entergy and paid Entergy to
    assume ownership and responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI. Our
    AROs related to Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI ended with the
    sale, and we removed the related ARO liabilities from our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also removed the Big Rock ARO
    related to the plant in the second quarter of 2007 due to the
    completion of decommissioning.

We reclassified $2 million in ARO liabilities to Noncurrent
    liabilities held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at
    December 31, 2006. These AROs were subsequently settled as
    a result of the sale of our businesses in Argentina and our
    northern Michigan non-utility natural gas assets to Lucid Energy.

9: INCOME
    TAXES

CMS Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal
    income tax return. Income taxes generally are allocated based on
    each company’s separate taxable income in accordance with
    the CMS Energy tax sharing agreement.

We use deferred tax accounting for temporary differences. These
    occur when there are differences between the book and tax
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. ITC has been
    deferred and is being amortized over the estimated service lives
    of the related properties. We use ITC to reduce current income
    taxes payable.

AMT paid generally becomes a tax credit that we can carry
    forward indefinitely to reduce regular tax liabilities in future
    periods when regular taxes paid exceed the tax calculated for
    AMT. At December 31, 2007, we had AMT credit carryforwards
    of $267 million that do not expire, and tax loss
    carryforwards of $995 million that expire from 2023 through
    2026, including SRLY tax loss carryforwards of $15 million
    that expire from 2018 through 2020. We do not believe that a
    valuation allowance is required, as we expect to use the loss
    carryforwards prior to their expiration. In addition, we had
    general business credit carryforwards of $17 million that
    expire from 2008 through 2027, and capital loss carryforwards of
    $18 million that expire in 2011. We have provided
    $9 million of valuation allowances for these items. It is
    reasonably possible that further adjustments will be made to the
    valuation allowance within one year. We recorded a benefit of
    $188 million for a future Michigan deduction, granted as
    part of the Michigan Business Tax legislation of 2007, offset by

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Current tax expense reflects the settlement of income tax audits
    for prior years, as well as the provision for the current
    year’s income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary
    differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and
    the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or
    noncurrent according to the classification of the related assets
    or liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not related
    to assets or liabilities are classified according to the
    expected reversal date of the temporary differences.

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits
    by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which can result
    in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome
    for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe
    that our accrued tax liabilities at December 31, 2007 are
    adequate for all years.

The principal components of deferred income tax assets
    (liabilities) recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets are

As of December 31, 2006, U.S. income taxes were not
    recorded on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    that had been or were intended to be reinvested indefinitely.
    During the first quarter of 2007, we announced we had signed
    agreements or plans to sell substantially all of our foreign
    assets or subsidiaries. These sales resulted in the recognition
    in 2007 of $71 million of U.S. income tax expense
    associated with the change in our assumption regarding permanent
    reinvestment of these undistributed earnings, with
    $46 million of this amount reflected in income from
    continuing operations and $25 million in discontinued
    operations. Additionally, gains on the sales of our
    international investments resulted in the release of
    $121 million of valuation allowance during 2007.

In June 2006, the IRS concluded its audit of CMS Energy and its
    subsidiaries and adjusted taxable income for the years ended
    December 31, 1987 through December 31, 2001. The
    overall cumulative increase to taxable income related primarily
    to the disallowance of the simplified service cost method with
    respect to certain self-constructed utility assets, resulting in
    a deferral of these expenses to future years. Reduction of our
    income tax provision is primarily due to the restoration and
    utilization of previously written off income tax credits. The
    years 2002 through 2006 are currently open under the statute of
    limitations and 2002 through 2005 are currently under audit by
    the IRS.

The American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) of 2004 created a one-time
    opportunity to receive a tax benefit for U.S. corporations
    that reinvest, in the U.S., dividends received in a year (2005
    for CMS Energy) from controlled foreign corporations. During
    2005, we repatriated $370 million of foreign earnings that
    qualified for the tax benefit. The repatriated earnings provided
    net tax benefits of $45 million in 2005, with
    $30 million of this amount reflected in income from
    continuing operations and $15 million in discontinued
    operations.

On January 1, 2007 we adopted the provisions of FASB
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes

. As a result of the implementation of
    FIN 48, we recorded a charge for additional uncertain tax
    benefits of $11 million, which was accounted for as a
    reduction of our beginning retained earnings. Included in this
    amount was an increase in our valuation allowance of
    $100 million, decreases to tax reserves of $61 million
    and a decrease to deferred tax liabilities of $28 million.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the balance at December 31, 2007, are
    $43 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of
    the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and
    penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period
    would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would
    accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an
    earlier period. As of December 31, 2007, remaining
    uncertain tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate
    in future years are $8 million. We are not expecting any
    other material changes to our uncertain tax positions over the
    next twelve months.

We have reflected a net interest liability of $2 million
    related to our uncertain income tax positions on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2007. We
    have not accrued any penalties with respect to uncertain tax
    benefits. We recognize accrued interest and penalties, where
    applicable, related to uncertain tax benefits as part of income
    tax expense.

Michigan Business Tax Act:

In July 2007, the
    Michigan governor signed Senate Bill 94, the Michigan Business
    Tax Act, which imposed a business income tax of
    4.95 percent and a modified gross receipts tax of
    0.8 percent. The bill provided for a number of tax credits
    and incentives geared toward those companies investing and
    employing in Michigan. The Michigan Business Tax, which was
    effective January 1, 2008, replaced the state’s Single
    Business Tax that expired on December 31, 2007. In
    September 2007, the Michigan governor signed House Bill 5104,
    allowing additional deductions in future years against the
    business income portion of the tax. These future deductions are
    phased in over a

15-year

period, beginning in 2015. As a result, our consolidated net
    deferred tax liability of $122 million, recorded due to the
    Michigan Business Tax enactment, was offset by a net deferred
    tax asset of $122 million. In December 2007, the Michigan
    governor signed House Bill 5408, replacing the expanded sales
    tax for certain services with a 21.99 percent surcharge on
    the business income tax and the modified gross receipts tax.
    Therefore, the total tax rates imposed under the Michigan
    Business Tax are 6.04 percent for the business income tax
    and 0.98 percent for the modified gross receipts tax.

10: STOCK
    BASED COMPENSATION

We provide a Performance Incentive Stock Plan (the Plan) to key
    employees and non-employee directors based on their
    contributions to the successful management of the company. The
    Plan has a five-year term, expiring in May 2009.

All grants under the Plan for 2007, 2006, and 2005 were in the
    form of total shareholder return (TSR) restricted stock and
    time-lapse restricted stock. Restricted stock recipients receive
    shares of CMS Energy’s Common Stock that have full dividend
    and voting rights. TSR restricted stock vesting is contingent on
    meeting a three-year service requirement and specific market
    conditions. Half of the market condition is based on the
    achievement of specified

CMS-88

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

levels of total shareholder return over a three-year period and
    half is based on a comparison of our total shareholder return
    with the median shareholders’ return of a peer group over
    the same three-year period. Depending on the performance of the
    market, a recipient may earn a total award ranging from
    0 percent to 150 percent of the initial grant.
    Time-lapse restricted stock vests after a service period of five
    years for awards granted prior to 2004 and three years for
    awards granted in 2004 and thereafter. Restricted stock awards
    granted to officers in 2006 and 2005 were entirely TSR
    restricted stock. Awards granted to officers in 2007 were
    80 percent TSR restricted stock and 20 percent
    time-lapsed restricted stock.

All restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if
    employment terminates before vesting. However, if certain
    minimum service requirements are met or are waived by action of
    the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of
    Directors, restricted shares may vest fully upon retirement or
    disability and vest fully if control of CMS Energy changes, as
    defined by the Plan. The Plan also allows for stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, phantom shares, and performance
    units, none of which were granted in 2007, 2006, or 2005.

Shares awarded or subject to stock options, phantom shares, and
    performance units may not exceed 6 million shares from June
    2004 through May 2009, nor may such awards to any recipient
    exceed 250,000 shares in any fiscal year. We may issue
    awards of up to 3,677,930 shares of common stock under the
    Plan at December 31, 2007. Shares for which payment or
    exercise is in cash, as well as forfeited shares or stock
    options, may be awarded or granted again under the Plan.

    the Plan:

During 2007, we granted 411,600 TSR shares and 105,020
    time-lapse shares of restricted stock. In addition, we granted
    205,250 shares that immediately vested as a result of
    achieving 150 percent of the market conditions on our 2004
    TSR restricted stock grant. The fair value at the date of grant
    in 2004 was $9.73. We excluded the impact of these shares from
    the weighted-average grant date fair value for the
    2007 shares granted.

We expense the awards’ fair value over the required service
    period. As a result, we recognize all compensation expense for
    share-based awards that have accelerated service provisions upon
    retirement by the period in which the employee becomes eligible
    to retire. We calculate the fair value of time-lapse restricted
    stock based on the price of our common stock on the grant date.
    The fair value of TSR restricted stock awards was calculated on
    the award grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. Expected
    volatilities were based on the historical volatility of the
    price of CMS Energy Common Stock. The risk-free rate for each
    valuation was based on the three-year U.S. Treasury yield
    at the award grant date. The following table summarizes the
    significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the
    TSR restricted stock awards:

    $2 million in 2005. At December 31, 2007, there was
    $7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related
    to restricted stock. We expect to recognize this cost over a
    weighted-average period of 1.4 years.

Stock options give the holder the right to purchase common stock
    at the market price on the grant date. Stock options are
    exercisable upon grant, and expire up to ten years and one month
    from the grant date. We issue new shares when recipients
    exercise stock options. The total intrinsic value of stock
    options exercised was $9 million in 2007, $1 million
    in 2006, and $2 million in 2005. Cash received from
    exercise of these stock options was $7 million in 2007.

Since we have utilized tax loss carryforwards, we were not able
    to realize the excess tax benefits upon exercise of stock
    options and vesting of restricted stock. Therefore, we did not
    recognize the related excess tax benefits in equity. As of
    December 31, 2007, we have $15 million of unrealized
    excess tax benefits.

No stock options were granted in 2007, 2006, or 2005.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to use the fair
    value of employee stock options and similar awards at the grant
    date to value the awards. SFAS No. 123(R) was
    effective for us on January 1, 2006. We elected to adopt
    the modified prospective method recognition provisions of this
    Statement instead of retrospective restatement. We adopted the
    fair value method of accounting for share-based awards effective
    December 2002. Therefore, SFAS No. 123(R) did not have
    a significant impact on our results of operations when it became
    effective.

11: LEASES

We lease various assets, including service vehicles, railcars,
    gas pipeline capacity and buildings. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 13, we account for a number of our power
    purchase agreements as capital and operating leases.

Operating leases for coal-carrying railcars have lease terms
    expiring over the next 15 years. These leases contain fair
    market value extension and buyout provisions, with some
    providing for predetermined extension period rentals. Capital
    leases for our vehicle fleet operations have a maximum term of
    120 months and TRAC end-of-life provisions.

We have capital leases for gas transportation pipelines to the
    Karn generating complex and Zeeland power plant. The capital
    lease for the gas transportation pipeline into the Karn
    generating complex has a term of 15 years with a provision
    to extend the contract from month to month. The capital lease
    for the gas transportation pipeline to

CMS-90

CMS ENERGY
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO

the Zeeland power plant has a lease term of 12 years with a
    renewal provision at the end of the contract. The remaining term
    of our long-term power purchase agreements range between 5 and
    22 years. Most of our power purchase agreements contain
    provisions at the end of the initial contract terms to renew the
    agreements annually.

Consumers is authorized by the MPSC to record both capital and
    operating lease payments as operating expense and recover the

In April 2007, we sold Palisades to Entergy and entered into a

15-year

power purchase agreement to buy all of the capacity and energy
    produced by Palisades, up to the annual average capacity of
    798 MW. We provided $30 million in security to Entergy
    for our power purchase agreement obligation in the form of a
    letter of credit. We estimate that capacity and energy payments
    under the Palisades power purchase agreement will average
    $300 million annually. Our total purchases of capacity and
    energy under the Palisades power purchase agreement were
    $180 million in 2007.

Because of the Palisades power purchase agreement and our
    continuing involvement with the Palisades assets, we accounted
    for the disposal of Palisades as a financing and not a sale.
    SFAS No. 98 specifies the accounting required for a
    seller’s sale and simultaneous leaseback involving real
    estate. We have continuing involvement with Palisades through
    security provided to Entergy for our power purchase agreement
    obligation and our DOE liability and other forms of involvement.
    As a result, we accounted for the Palisades plant, which is the
    real estate asset subject to the leaseback, as a financing for
    accounting purposes and not a sale. As a financing, no gain on
    the sale of Palisades was recognized in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income (Loss). We accounted for the remaining
    non-real estate assets and liabilities associated with the
    transaction as a sale.

CMS ENERGY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

As a financing, the Palisades plant remains on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets and we continue to depreciate it. We recorded the
    related proceeds as a finance obligation with payments recorded
    to interest expense and the finance obligation based on the
    amortization of the obligation over the life of the Palisades
    power purchase agreement. The value of the finance obligation
    was based on an allocation of the transaction proceeds to the
    fair values of the net assets sold and fair value of the
    Palisades plant asset under the financing. Total charges under
    the financing were $10 million in 2007.

    Amortization of intangible assets is forecasted to range between
    $12 million and $22 million per year over the next
    five years.

Asset Acquisition:

In December 2007, we purchased a
    935 MW gas-fired power plant located in Zeeland, Michigan
    for $519 million from an affiliate of LS Power Group. The
    original cost of the plant was $350 million and the plant
    acquisition adjustment was $213 million. This results in an
    increase to property, plant, and equipment of $519 million,
    net of $44 million of accumulated depreciation. The
    purchase also increased capital leases by $12 million. For

13: EQUITY
    METHOD INVESTMENTS

We account for certain investments in other companies,
    partnerships, and joint ventures using the equity method, in
    accordance with APB Opinion No. 18, when we have
    significant influence, typically when ownership is more than
    20 percent but less than a majority. Earnings from equity
    method investments was $40 million in 2007,
    $89 million in 2006, and $125 million in 2005. The
    amount of consolidated retained earnings that represents
    undistributed earnings from these equity method investments was
    $22 million as of December 31, 2007, $14 million
    as of December 31, 2006, and $17 million as of
    December 31, 2005.

If assets or income from continuing operations associated with
    any of our equity method investments exceeds 10 percent of
    our consolidated assets or income, then summarized financial
    data of that subsidiary must be presented in our notes. If
    assets or income from continuing operations associated with any
    of our equity method investments exceeds 20 percent of our
    consolidated assets or income, then separate audited financial
    statements must be presented as an exhibit to our

Form 10-K.

At December 31, 2007, no equity method investments exceeded
    the 10 percent threshold. At December 31, 2006, and
    December 31, 2005, Jorf Lasfar exceeded the 10 percent
    threshold and no equity method investments exceeded the
    20 percent threshold.

Net investment is the amount of utility plant in service less

We include our share of the direct expenses of the jointly owned
    plants in operating expenses. We share operation, maintenance,
    and other expenses of these jointly owned utility facilities in
    proportion to each participant’s undivided ownership
    interest. We are required to provide only our share of financing
    for the jointly owned utility facilities.

15: REPORTABLE
    SEGMENTS

Our reportable segments consist of business units defined by the
    products and services they offer. We evaluate performance based
    on the net income of each segment. These reportable segments are:

•

electric utility, consisting of regulated activities associated
    with the generation and distribution of electricity in Michigan
    through our subsidiary, Consumers,

•

gas utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with
    the transportation, storage, and distribution of natural gas in
    Michigan through our subsidiary, Consumers, and

•

enterprises, consisting of various subsidiaries engaging
    primarily in domestic independent power production.

Accounting policies of our segments are as described in the
    summary of significant accounting policies. Our consolidated
    financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues,
    and expenses of the individual segments when appropriate. We
    allocate accounts among the segments when common accounts are
    attributable to more than one segment. The allocations are based
    on certain measures of business activities, such as revenue,
    labor dollars, customers, other operation and maintenance
    expense, construction expense, leased property, taxes or
    functional surveys. For example, customer receivables are
    allocated based on revenue, and pension provisions are allocated
    based on labor dollars.

We account for inter-segment sales and transfers at current
    market prices and eliminate them in consolidated net income
    (loss) by segment. The “Other” segment includes
    corporate interest and other expenses, and certain deferred
    income taxes. We have reclassified certain amounts in 2006 and
    2005 to include CMS Capital results in the Other segment.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and
    the related consolidated statements of income (loss), of cash
    flows, and of common stockholders’ equity present fairly,
    in all material respects, the financial position of CMS Energy
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007, and
    the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
    listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements and on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our integrated audit. We
    conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain income tax provisions in 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of
    Directors and Stockholders of CMS Energy Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    CMS Energy Corporation (a Michigan Corporation) as of
    December 31, 2006, and the related consolidated statements
    of income (loss), common stockholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the two years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedules as it relates to 2006 and 2005 listed in the
    Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and
    schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedules based on our audits. We did
    not audit the financial statements of Midland Cogeneration
    Venture Limited Partnership, a former 49% owned variable
    interest entity which has been consolidated through the date of
    sale, November 21, 2006 (Note 2), which statements
    reflect total revenues constituting 8.9% in 2006 and 10.1% in
    2005 of the related consolidated totals. Those statements were
    audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us,
    and our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,
    insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the periods
    indicated above for Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited
    Partnership is based solely on the report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the
    report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other
    auditors, the financial statements referred to above present
    fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
    position of CMS Energy Corporation at December 31, 2006,
    and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
    flows for each of the two years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedules, when considered in
    relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
    present fairly in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial
    statements, in 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132(R).” As discussed in Note 10 to the
    consolidated financial statements, in 2006, the Company adopted
    FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R)
    “Share-Based Payment.”

(a)

Until their sale in November 2006 , we were the primary
    beneficiary of both the MCV Partnership and the FMLP. As a
    result, we consolidated their assets, liabilities and activities
    into our consolidated financial statements as of and for the
    years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. These partnerships
    had third party obligations totaling $482 million at
    December 31, 2005 and $582 million at

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

Consumers, a subsidiary of CMS Energy, a holding company, is a
    combination electric and gas utility company serving in
    Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Our customer base includes a
    mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial
    customers.

CE-4

Consumers
    Energy Company

We manage our business by the nature of services each provides
    and operate principally in two business segments: electric
    utility and gas utility. Our electric utility operations include
    the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity.
    Our gas utility operations include the purchase, transportation,
    storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas.

We earn our revenue and generate cash from operations by
    providing electric and natural gas utility services, electric
    power generation, gas distribution, transmission, and storage,
    and other energy related services. Our businesses are affected
    primarily by:

•

weather, especially during the normal heating and cooling
    seasons,

•

economic conditions,

•

regulation and regulatory issues,

•

energy commodity prices,

•

interest rates, and

•

our debt credit rating.

During the past several years, our business strategy has
    emphasized improving our consolidated balance sheet and
    maintaining focus on our core strength: utility operations and
    service.

We sold Palisades to Entergy in April 2007 for
    $380 million, and received $363 million after various
    closing adjustments. We also paid Entergy $30 million to
    assume ownership and responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI. We
    entered into a

15-year

power purchase agreement with Entergy for 100 percent of
    the plant’s current electric output. The sale improved our
    cash flow, reduced our nuclear operating and decommissioning
    risk, and increased our financial flexibility to support other
    utility investments. The MPSC order approving the transaction
    requires that we credit $255 million of excess proceeds and
    decommissioning amounts to our retail customers by December
    2008. There are additional excess sales proceeds and
    decommissioning fund balances of $134 million above the
    amount in the MPSC order. The distribution of these additional
    amounts has not yet been addressed by the MPSC.

In September 2007, we exercised the regulatory-out provision in
    the MCV PPA, thus limiting the amount we pay the MCV Partnership
    for capacity and fixed energy to the amount recoverable from our
    customers. The MCV Partnership may, under certain circumstances,
    have the right to terminate or reduce the amount of capacity
    sold under the MCV PPA, which could affect our need to build or
    purchase additional generating capacity. The MCV Partnership has
    notified us that it disputes our right to exercise the
    regulatory-out provision.

In May 2007, we filed with the MPSC our Balanced Energy
    Initiative, which is a comprehensive plan to meet customer
    energy needs over the next 20 years. The plan is designed
    to meet the growing customer demand for electricity with energy
    efficiency, demand management, expanded use of renewable energy,
    and development of new power plants to complement existing
    generating sources. In September 2007, we filed with the MPSC
    the second phase of our Balanced Energy Initiative, which
    contains our plan for construction of a new 800 MW clean
    coal plant at an existing site located near Bay City, Michigan.

In December 2007, we purchased a 935 MW natural gas-fired
    power plant located in Zeeland, Michigan from Broadway Gen
    Funding LLC, an affiliate of LS Power Group, for
    $519 million. This plant fits in with our Balanced Energy
    Initiative as it will help provide the capacity we need to meet
    the growing needs of our customers.

In the future, we will continue to focus on:

•

investing in our utility system to enable us to meet our
    customer commitments, comply with increasing environmental
    performance standards, improve system performance, and maintain
    adequate supply and capacity,

•

growing earnings while controlling operating and fuel costs,

•

managing cash flow issues, and

CE-5

Consumers
    Energy Company

•

maintaining principles of safe, efficient operations, customer
    value, fair and timely regulation, and consistent financial
    performance.

As we execute our strategy, we will need to overcome a sluggish
    Michigan economy that has been hampered by negative developments
    in Michigan’s automotive industry and limited growth in the
    non-manufacturing sectors of the state’s economy. While the
    recent sub-prime mortgage market weakness has disrupted
    financial markets and the U.S. economy, it has not impacted
    materially our financial condition. We will continue to monitor
    developments for potential impacts on our business.

For 2007, our net income available to our common stockholder was
    $310 million, compared to $184 million for 2006. In
    2006, we sold our ownership interest in the MCV Partnership.
    Accordingly, in 2007, we are no longer experiencing
    mark-to-market losses on certain long-term gas contracts and
    associated financial hedges at the MCV Partnership. The increase
    in 2007 also reflects higher net income from our gas utility due
    to colder weather, and gas rate increases authorized in November
    2006 and August 2007. Partially offsetting these gains was a
    small decrease in electric net income, influenced by several
    factors, including regulatory disallowances in 2007, higher
    property taxes, and higher electric deliveries.

Specific changes to net income available to our common
    stockholder for 2007 versus 2006 are:

•

lower operating and maintenance costs primarily due to the sale
    of Palisades in April 2007,

For 2006, our net income available to our common stockholder was
    $184 million, compared to a net loss available to our
    common stockholder of $98 million for 2005. The increase
    was primarily due to the absence of a 2005 impairment charge to
    property, plant, and equipment at the MCV Partnership partially
    offset by charges related to the sale of the MCV Partnership
    recorded in 2006. For additional details on the impairment and
    sale of the MCV Facility, see Note 2, Asset Sales and
    Impairment Charges. The increase also reflects higher net income
    from our electric utility, primarily due to increased revenue
    resulting from an electric rate order, the expiration of rate
    caps on our residential customers, and the return of former ROA
    customers to full-service rates. Partially offsetting these
    increases were higher operating and maintenance costs at our
    electric utility, and a reduction in net income from our gas
    utility. Lower, weather-driven sales at our gas utility exceeded
    the benefits from lower operating costs and a gas rate increase
    authorized by the MPSC in November of 2006.

Specific changes to net income available to our common
    stockholder for 2006 versus 2005 are:

Electric deliveries:

For 2007, electric delivery
    revenues increased $18 million versus 2006, as deliveries
    to end-use customers were 38.8 billion kWh, an increase of
    0.3 billion kWh or 0.8 percent versus 2006. The
    increase in electric deliveries was primarily due to favorable
    weather, which resulted in an increase in electric delivery
    revenues of $14 million. The increase also reflects
    $2 million of additional revenue from the inclusion of the
    Zeeland power plant in rates and $2 million related to the
    return of additional former ROA customers.

For 2006, electric delivery revenues increased by
    $193 million over 2005 despite the fact that electric
    deliveries to end-use customers were 38.5 billion kWh, a
    decrease of 0.4 billion kWh or 1.2 percent versus
    2005. The decrease in deliveries was primarily due to milder
    summer weather compared with 2005, which resulted in a decrease
    in revenue of $16 million. However, despite these lower
    electric deliveries, electric delivery revenues increased
    $160 million due to an approved electric rate order in
    December 2005 and $49 million related to the return of
    additional former ROA customers.

Surcharge revenue:

For 2007, the $6 million
    increase in surcharge revenue was primarily due to a surcharge
    that we started collecting in the first quarter of 2006 that the
    MPSC authorized under Section 10d(4) of the Customer Choice
    Act. The surcharge factors increased in January 2007 pursuant to
    an MPSC order. This surcharge increased electric delivery
    revenue by $13 million in 2007 versus 2006. Partially
    offsetting this increase was a decrease in the collection of
    Customer Choice Act transition costs, due to the expiration of
    the surcharge period for our large commercial and industrial
    customers. The absence of this surcharge decreased electric
    delivery revenue by $7 million in 2007 versus 2006.

In the first quarter of 2006, we started collecting the
    surcharge that the MPSC authorized under Section 10d(4) of
    the Customer Choice Act. This surcharge increased electric
    delivery revenue by $51 million in 2006 versus 2005. In
    addition, in the first quarter of 2006, we started collecting
    customer choice transition costs from our residential customers
    that increased electric delivery revenue by $12 million in
    2006 versus 2005. Reductions in other surcharges decreased
    electric delivery revenue by $2 million in 2006 versus 2005.

Palisades revenue to PSCR:

Consistent with the MPSC
    order related to the April 2007 sale of Palisades,
    $136 million of revenue related to Palisades was designated
    toward recovery of PSCR costs.

Power supply costs and related revenue:

For 2007,
    PSCR revenue decreased by $17 million versus 2006. This
    decrease primarily reflects amounts excluded from recovery in
    the 2006 PSCR reconciliation case. The

CE-8

Consumers
    Energy Company

decrease also reflects the absence, in 2007, of an increase in
    Power Supply Revenue associated with the 2005 PSCR
    reconciliation case.

For 2006, PSCR revenue increased $57 million versus 2005.
    The increase was due to the absence, in 2006, of rate caps which
    allowed us to record power supply revenue to offset fully our
    power supply costs. Our ability to recover these power supply
    costs resulted in an $82 million increase in electric
    revenue in 2006 versus 2005. Additionally, electric revenue
    increased $9 million in 2006 versus 2005 primarily due to
    the return of former special-contract customers to full-service
    rates in 2006. Partially offsetting these increases was the
    absence, in 2006, of deferrals of transmission and nitrogen
    oxides allowance expenditures related to our capped customers
    recorded in 2005. These costs were not fully recoverable due to
    the application of rate caps, so we deferred them for recovery
    under Section 10d(4) of the Customer Choice Act. In
    December 2005, the MPSC approved the recovery of these costs.
    For 2005, deferrals of these costs were $34 million.

Other operating expenses, other income, and non-commodity
    revenue:

For 2007, other operating expenses decreased
    $150 million, other income increased $21 million, and
    non-commodity revenue decreased $12 million versus 2006.

The decrease in other operating expenses was primarily due to
    lower operating and maintenance expense. Operating and
    maintenance expense decreased primarily due to the sale of
    Palisades in April 2007. Also contributing to the decrease was
    the absence, in 2007, of costs incurred in 2006 related to a
    planned refueling outage at Palisades, and lower overhead line
    maintenance and storm restoration costs. These decreases were
    partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization
    expense due to higher plant in service and greater amortization
    of certain regulatory assets.

Other income increased in 2007 versus 2006 primarily due to
    higher interest income on short-term cash investments. The
    increase in short-term cash investments was primarily due to
    proceeds from the Palisades sale and equity infusions from CMS
    Energy. Non-commodity revenue decreased in 2007 versus 2006
    primarily due to lower transmission services revenue.

For 2006, other operating expenses increased $236 million
    versus 2005. The increase in other operating expenses reflects
    higher operating and maintenance, customer service, depreciation
    and amortization, and pension and benefit expenses. Operating
    and maintenance expense increased primarily due to costs related
    to a planned refueling outage at Palisades, and higher tree
    trimming and storm restoration costs.

Regulatory return on capital expenditures:

For 2007,
    the return on capital expenditures in excess of our depreciation
    base increased income by $5 million versus 2006. The
    increase reflects the equity return on the regulatory asset
    authorized by the MPSC’s December 2005 order which provided
    for the recovery of $333 million of Section 10d(4)
    costs over five years.

For 2006, the return on capital expenditures in excess of our
    depreciation base increased income by $22 million versus
    2005.

General taxes:

For 2007, the $15 million
    increase in general taxes versus 2006 was primarily due to
    higher property tax expense, reflecting higher millage rates and
    lower property tax refunds versus 2006.

For 2006, the $7 million increase in general taxes versus
    2005 reflects higher MSBT expense, partially offset by property
    tax refunds.

Interest charges:

For 2007, interest charges
    increased $18 million versus 2006. The increase was
    primarily due to interest on amounts to be refunded to customers
    as a result of the sale of Palisades as ordered by the MPSC.

For 2006, interest charges increased $34 million versus
    2005 primarily due to lower capitalized interest and interest
    expense related to an IRS income tax audit settlement. In 2005,
    we capitalized $33 million of interest in connection with
    the MPSC’s December 2005 order in our Section 10d(4)
    Regulatory Asset case. The IRS income tax settlement in 2006
    recognized that our taxable income for prior years was higher
    than originally filed, resulting in interest on the tax
    liability for these prior years.

CE-9

Consumers
    Energy Company

Income taxes:

For 2007, income taxes increased
    $5 million versus 2006 primarily due to the absence, in
    2007, of a $4 million income tax benefit from the
    restoration and utilization of income tax credits resulting from
    the resolution of an IRS income tax audit.

For 2006, income taxes increased $10 million versus 2005
    primarily due to higher earnings by the electric utility,
    partially offset by the resolution of an IRS income tax audit,
    which resulted in a $4 million income tax benefit caused by
    the restoration and utilization of income tax credits. Further
    reducing the increase in income taxes was $5 million of
    income tax benefits, primarily reflecting the tax treatment of
    items related to property, plant and equipment as required by
    past MPSC orders.

Gas deliveries:

For 2007, gas delivery revenues
    increased by $10 million versus 2006 as gas deliveries,
    including miscellaneous transportation to end-use customers,
    were 300 bcf, an increase of 18 bcf or 6.4 percent. The
    increase in gas deliveries was primarily due to colder weather,
    partially offset by lower system efficiency.

In 2006, gas delivery revenues decreased by $61 million
    versus 2005 as gas deliveries, including miscellaneous
    transportation to end-use customers, were 282 bcf, a decrease of
    36 bcf or 11.3 percent. The decrease in gas deliveries was
    primarily due to warmer weather in 2006 versus 2005 and
    increased customer conservation efforts in response to higher
    gas prices.

Gas rate increase:

In November 2006, the MPSC issued
    an order authorizing an annual rate increase of
    $81 million. In August 2007, the MPSC issued an order
    authorizing an annual rate increase of $50 million. As a
    result of these orders, gas revenues increased $81 million
    for 2007 versus 2006.

In May 2006, the MPSC issued an interim gas rate order
    authorizing an $18 million annual rate increase. In
    November 2006, the MPSC issued an order authorizing an annual
    increase of $81 million. As a result of these orders, gas
    revenues increased $14 million for 2006 versus 2005.

Gas wholesale and retail services, other gas revenues, and
    other income:

For 2007, the $14 million increase
    in gas wholesale and retail services, other gas revenue and
    other income primarily reflects higher interest income on
    short-term cash investments. The increase in short-term cash
    investments was primarily due to proceeds from the Palisades
    sale and equity infusions from CMS Energy.

For 2006, the $24 million increase in gas wholesale and
    retail services, other gas revenues, and other income primarily
    reflects higher pipeline revenues and higher pipeline capacity
    optimization in 2006 versus 2005.

CE-10

Consumers

Other operating expenses:

For 2007, other operating
    expenses increased $19 million versus 2006 primarily due to
    higher uncollectible accounts expense and payments, beginning in
    November 2006, to a fund that provides energy assistance to
    low-income customers.

For 2006, other operating expenses decreased $7 million
    versus 2005 primarily due to lower operating expenses, partially
    offset by higher customer service and pension and benefit
    expenses.

General taxes and depreciation:

For 2007, general
    taxes and depreciation increased $11 million versus 2006.
    The increase in general taxes reflects higher property tax
    expense due to higher millage rates and lower property tax
    refunds versus 2006. The increase in depreciation expense is
    primarily due to higher plant in service.

For 2006, general taxes and depreciation expense increased
    $10 million versus 2005. The increase in depreciation
    expense was primarily due to higher plant in service. The
    increase in general taxes reflects higher MSBT expense,
    partially offset by lower property tax expense.

Interest charges:

For 2007, interest charges
    decreased $4 million reflecting lower average debt levels
    and a lower average interest rate versus 2006.

For 2006, interest charges increased $6 million primarily
    due to higher interest expense on our GCR overrecovery balance
    and an IRS income tax audit settlement. The settlement
    recognized that Consumers’ taxable income for prior years
    was higher than originally filed, resulting in interest on the
    tax liability for these prior years.

Income taxes:

For 2007, income taxes increased
    $29 million versus 2006 primarily due to higher earnings by
    the gas utility.

For 2006, income taxes decreased $21 million versus 2005
    primarily due to lower earnings by the gas utility. Also
    contributing to the decrease was the absence, in 2006, of the
    write-off of general business credits of $2 million that
    expired in 2005, and the resolution, in 2006, of an IRS income
    tax audit, which resulted in a $3 million income tax
    benefit caused by the restoration and utilization of income tax
    credits. Further reducing the increase in income taxes was
    $5 million of income tax benefits, primarily reflecting the
    tax treatment of items related to property, plant and equipment
    as required by past MPSC orders.

For 2007, net income from other nonutility operations was
    $27 million, an increase of $79 million versus 2006.
    In late 2006, we sold our ownership interest in the MCV
    Partnership. Accordingly, in 2007, the increase in earnings
    primarily reflects the absence, in 2007, of mark-to-market
    losses on certain long-term gas contracts and associated
    financial hedges at the MCV Partnership. Also contributing to
    the increase was lower income tax expense, reflecting higher
    expected utilization of capital loss carryforwards. See
    Note 8, Income Taxes, for further details.

For 2006, other nonutility operations were a net loss of
    $52 million, an increase of $247 million versus 2005.
    The change is primarily due to a $225 million increase in
    earnings related to our ownership interest in the MCV
    Partnership, primarily due to the absence of a 2005 impairment
    charge to property, plant, and equipment at the MCV Partnership.
    Partially offsetting this increase were charges related to the
    sale of the MCV Partnership recorded in 2006 and mark-to-market
    losses on the MCV Partnership’s long-term gas contracts and
    associated hedges (which partially reduced gains recorded in
    2005).

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following accounting policies and related information are
    important to an understanding of our results of operations and
    financial condition and should be considered an integral part of
    our MD&A. For additional accounting policies, see
    Note 1, Corporate Structure and Accounting Policies.

Use
    of Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we use
    estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and
    disclosures. We use accounting estimates for asset valuations,
    depreciation, amortization, financial and derivative
    instruments, employee benefits, indemnifications and
    contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimated results
    due to changes in the regulatory environment, competition,
    regulatory decisions, lawsuits, and other factors.

Contingencies:

We record a liability for
    contingencies when we conclude that it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors in making
    these assessments.

Long-Lived Assets and Investments:

Our assessment of
    the recoverability of long-lived assets and investments involves
    critical accounting estimates. We periodically perform tests of
    impairment if certain conditions triggering events occur or if
    there has been a decline in value that may be other than
    temporary. Of our total assets, recorded at $13.401 billion
    at December 31, 2007, 64 percent represent long-lived
    assets and investments that are subject to this type of
    analysis. We base our evaluations of impairment on such
    indicators as:

•

the nature of the assets,

•

projected future economic benefits,

•

regulatory and political environments,

•

historical and future cash flow and profitability
    measurements, and

•

other external market conditions and factors.

The estimates we use can change over time, which could have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For
    additional details, see Note 1, Corporate Structure and
    Accounting Policies — “Impairment of Investments
    and Long-Lived Assets.”

Accounting
    for the Effects of Industry Regulation

Our involvement in a regulated industry requires us to use
    SFAS No. 71 to account for the effects of the
    regulators’ decisions that impact the timing and
    recognition of our revenues and expenses. As a result, we may
    defer or recognize revenues and expenses differently than a
    non-regulated entity.

For example, we may record as regulatory assets items that a
    non-regulated entity normally would expense if the actions of
    the regulator indicate such expenses will be recovered in future
    rates. Conversely, we may record as regulatory liabilities items
    that non-regulated entities may normally recognize as revenues
    if the actions of the regulator indicate they will require that
    such revenues be refunded to customers. Judgment is required to
    determine the recoverability of items recorded as regulatory
    assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2007, we had
    $2.059 billion recorded as regulatory assets and
    $2.137 billion recorded as regulatory liabilities.

Our PSCR and GCR cost recovery mechanisms also give rise to
    probable future revenues that will be recovered from customers
    or past overrecoveries that will be refunded to customers
    through the ratemaking process. Underrecoveries are included in
    Accrued power supply and gas revenue and overrecoveries are
    included in Accrued rate refunds on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. At December 31, 2007, we had $45 million
    recorded as regulatory assets for underrecoveries of power
    supply costs and $19 million recorded as regulatory
    liabilities for overrecoveries of gas costs.

    Accounting Policies — “Utility Regulation.”

Accounting
    for Financial and Derivative Instruments and Market Risk
    Information

Financial Instruments:

Debt and equity securities
    classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value
    determined from quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and
    losses resulting from changes in fair value of
    available-for-sale debt and equity securities are reported, net
    of tax, in equity as part of AOCI. Unrealized losses are
    excluded from earnings unless the related changes in fair value
    are determined to be other than temporary.

Derivative Instruments:

We use the criteria in
    SFAS No. 133 to determine if we need to account for
    certain contracts as derivative instruments. These criteria are
    complex and often require significant judgment in applying them
    to specific contracts. If a contract is a derivative and does
    not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception under
    SFAS No. 133, it is recorded on our consolidated
    balance sheet at its fair value. Each quarter, we adjust the
    resulting asset or liability to reflect any change in the fair
    value of the contract, a practice known as marking the contract
    to market. For additional details on our derivatives, see
    Note 5, Financial and Derivative Instruments.

To determine the fair value of our derivatives, we use
    information from external sources, such as quoted market prices
    and other valuation information. For certain contracts, this
    information is not available and we use mathematical models to
    value our derivatives. These models use various inputs and
    assumptions, including commodity market prices and volatilities,
    as well as interest rates and contract maturity dates. The fair
    values we calculate for our derivatives may change significantly
    as commodity prices and volatilities change. The cash returns we
    actually realize on our derivatives may be different from the
    results that we estimate using models. If necessary, our
    calculations of fair value include reserves to reflect the
    credit risk of our counterparties.

The types of contracts we typically classify as derivatives are
    interest rate swaps and gas supply options. Most of our
    commodity purchase and sale contracts are not subject to
    derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133 because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units
    specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity
    or bcf of natural gas),

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales
    exception, or

•

there is not an active market for the commodity.

Our coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is
    not an active market for the coal we purchase. If an active
    market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts
    may qualify as derivatives. Under regulatory accounting, the
    resulting mark-to-market gains and losses would be offset by
    changes in regulatory assets and liabilities and would not
    affect net income.

Market Risk Information:

We are exposed to market
    risks including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates,
    commodity prices, and equity security prices. We may use various
    contracts to limit our exposure to these risks, including swaps,
    options, and forward contracts. We enter into these risk
    management contracts using established policies and procedures,
    under the direction of two different committees: an executive
    oversight committee consisting of senior management
    representatives and a risk committee consisting of business unit
    managers.

These contracts contain credit risk, which is the risk that our
    counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations.
    We reduce this risk through established credit policies, such as
    evaluating our counterparties’ credit quality and setting
    collateral requirements as necessary. If terms permit, we use
    standard agreements that allow us to net positive and negative
    exposures associated with the same counterparty. Given these
    policies, our current exposures, and our credit reserves, we do
    not expect a material adverse effect on our financial position
    or future earnings because of counterparty nonperformance.

The following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss
    in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from our financial
    instruments, including our derivative contracts, assuming a
    hypothetical adverse change in market rates or

CE-13

Consumers
    Energy Company

prices of 10 percent. Potential losses could exceed the
    amounts shown in the sensitivity analyses if changes in market
    rates or prices exceed 10 percent.

Interest Rate Risk:

We are exposed to interest rate
    risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate and variable-rate
    financing instruments, and from interest rate swap agreements.
    We use a combination of these instruments to manage this risk as
    deemed appropriate, based upon market conditions. These
    strategies are designed to provide and maintain a balance
    between risk and the lowest cost of capital.

(a)

Fair value reduction could only be realized if we transferred
    all of our fixed-rate financing to other creditors.

At December 31, 2007, we had $131 million in variable
    auction rate tax exempt bonds, insured by monoline insurers,
    that are subject to rate reset every 35 days. The subprime
    mortgage problems have put monoline insurers’ credit
    ratings at risk of downgrade by rating agencies. This risk of
    downgrade could cause the interest rates on these bonds to rise.
    We do not expect our interest rate risk exposure regarding these
    bonds to be material. We are continuing to monitor the situation
    and our alternatives

Commodity Price Risk:

Operating in the energy
    industry, we are exposed to commodity price risk, which arises
    from fluctuations in the price of electricity, natural gas,
    coal, and other commodities. Commodity prices are influenced by
    a number of factors, including weather, changes in supply and
    demand, and liquidity of commodity markets. In order to manage
    commodity price risk, we may enter into various non-trading
    derivative contracts, such as gas supply call and put options.
    As of December 31, 2007, we did not hold any such contracts.

Investment Securities Price Risk:

Our investments in
    debt and equity securities are exposed to changes in interest
    rates and price fluctuations in equity markets. The following
    table shows the potential effect of adverse changes in interest
    rates and fluctuations in equity prices on our

Pension
    and OPEB

Pension:

We have external trust funds to provide
    retirement pension benefits to our employees under a
    non-contributory, defined benefit Pension Plan. On
    September 1, 2005, the defined benefit Pension Plan was
    closed to new participants and we implemented the qualified
    DCCP, which provides an employer contribution of 5 percent
    of base pay to the existing Employees’ Savings Plan. An
    employee contribution is not required to receive the plan’s
    employer cash contribution. All employees hired on or after
    September 1, 2005 participate in this plan as part of their
    retirement benefit program. Previous cash balance pension plan
    participants also participate in the DCCP as of
    September 1, 2005. Additional pay credits under the cash
    balance pension plan were discontinued as of that date.

401(k):

We resumed the employer’s match in CMS
    Energy Common Stock in our 401(k) savings plan on
    January 1, 2005. On September 1, 2005, we increased
    the employer match from 50 percent to 60 percent on
    eligible contributions up to the first six percent of an
    employee’s wages.

CE-14

Consumers
    Energy Company

Beginning May 1, 2007, the CMS Energy Common Stock Fund was
    no longer an investment option available for investments in the
    401(k) savings plan and the employer match was no longer in CMS
    Energy Common Stock. Participants had an opportunity to
    reallocate investments in the CMS Energy Common Stock Fund to
    other plan investment alternatives prior to November 1,
    2007. In November 2007, the remaining shares in the CMS Energy
    Common Stock Fund were sold and the sale proceeds were
    reallocated to other plan investment options.

OPEB:

We provide postretirement health and life
    benefits under our OPEB plan to qualifying retired employees.

In accordance with SFAS No. 158, we record liabilities
    for pension and OPEB on our consolidated balance sheet at the
    present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets.
    We use SFAS No. 87 to account for pension expense and SFAS
    No. 106 to account for other postretirement benefit
    expense. The calculation of the liabilities and associated
    expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and requires many
    assumptions, including:

•

life expectancies,

•

present-value discount rates,

•

expected long-term rate of return on plan assets,

•

rate of compensation increases, and

•

anticipated health care costs.

A change in these assumptions could change significantly our
    recorded liabilities and associated expenses.

The following table provides an estimate of our pension cost,
    OPEB cost, and cash contributions for the next three years:

Actual future pension cost and contributions will depend on
    future investment performance, changes in future discount rates
    and various other factors related to the populations
    participating in the Pension Plan.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the Pension
    Plan assets by 0.25 percent (from 8.25 percent to
    8.00 percent) would increase estimated pension cost for
    2008 by $3 million. Lowering the discount rate by
    0.25 percent (from 6.40 percent to 6.15 percent)
    would increase estimated pension cost for 2008 by
    $1 million.

For additional details on postretirement benefits, see
    Note 6, Retirement Benefits.

Accounting
    For Asset Retirement Obligations

We are required to record the fair value of the cost to remove
    assets at the end of their useful lives, if there is a legal
    obligation to remove them. We have legal obligations to remove
    some of our assets at the end of their useful lives. We
    calculate the fair value of ARO liabilities using an expected
    present value technique, that reflects assumptions about costs,
    inflation, and profit margin that third parties would consider
    to assume the obligation. No market risk premium was included in
    our ARO fair value estimate since a reasonable estimate could
    not be made.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the
    period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with
    indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Generally, our
    gas transmission and electric and gas distribution assets have
    indeterminate lives and retirement cash flows that cannot be
    determined. However, we have recorded an ARO for our obligation
    to cut, purge, and cap abandoned gas distribution mains and gas
    services at the end of their useful lives. We have not recorded
    a liability

for assets that have insignificant cumulative disposal costs,
    such as substation batteries. For additional details, see
    Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations.

Related
    Party Transactions

We enter into a number of significant transactions with related
    parties. These transactions include:

•

purchase and sale of electricity from and to Enterprises,

•

payment of parent company overhead costs to CMS Energy, and

•

investment in CMS Energy Common Stock.

Transactions involving the power supply purchases from certain
    affiliates of Enterprises are based upon avoided costs under
    PURPA and competitive bidding. The payment of parent company
    overhead costs is based on the use of accepted industry
    allocation methodologies.

For additional details on related party transactions, see
    Note 1, Corporate Structure and Accounting Policies,
    “Related Party Transactions.”

Capital
    Resources and Liquidity

Factors affecting our liquidity and capital requirements include:

•

results of operations,

•

capital expenditures,

•

energy commodity and transportation costs,

•

contractual obligations,

•

regulatory decisions,

•

debt maturities,

•

credit ratings,

•

working capital needs, and

•

collateral requirements.

During the summer months, we buy natural gas and store it for
    resale during the winter heating season. Although our prudent
    natural gas costs are recoverable from our customers, the
    storage of natural gas as inventory requires additional
    liquidity due to the lag in cost recovery.

Our cash management plan includes controlling operating expenses
    and capital expenditures and evaluation of market conditions for
    financing opportunities, if needed.

We believe the following items will be sufficient to meet our
    liquidity needs:

•

our current level of cash and revolving credit facilities,

•

our anticipated cash flows from operating and investing
    activities, and

•

our ability to access secured and unsecured borrowing capacity
    in the capital markets, if necessary.

In the second quarter of 2007, Moody’s and S&P
    upgraded our long-term credit ratings and revised our rating
    outlook to stable from positive.

Operating
    Activities:

2007:

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $442 million, a decrease of $31 million versus 2006.
    This decrease was driven by the following:

•

the absence, in 2007, of the sale of accounts receivable,

•

a payment to fund our Pension Plan,

•

refunds to customers of excess Palisades decommissioning
    funds, and

•

other timing differences.

These decreases were partially offset by increased earnings and:

•

the absence, in 2007, of tax payments made to the parent related
    to the 2006 IRS income tax audit,

•

the absence of the release of the MCV Partnership gas supplier
    funds on deposit due to the sale of our interest in the MCV
    Partnership in 2006, and

•

a decrease in expenditures for gas inventory as the milder
    winter in 2006 allowed us to accumulate more gas in our storage
    facilities.

For additional details on the excess Palisades decommissioning
    funds, see Note 2, Asset Sales and Impairment Charges.

2006:

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $473 million, a decrease of $166 million versus 2005.
    This decrease was driven by the following:

•

decreases in the MCV Partnership gas supplier funds on deposit
    resulting in refunds to suppliers from decreased exposure to
    declining gas prices in 2006,

•

income tax payments to the parent related to the 2006 IRS income
    tax audit, and

•

decreases in accounts payable mainly due to payments for
    higher-priced gas that were accrued at December 31, 2005.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

a decrease in accounts receivable due to the collection of
    receivables in 2006 reflecting higher gas prices billed during
    the latter part of 2005 and reduced billings in the latter part
    of 2006 due to milder weather, and

•

reduced inventory purchases.

Investing
    Activities:

2007:

Net cash used in investing activities was
    $585 million, a decrease of $87 million versus 2006.
    This decrease was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of
    Palisades and the related dissolution of our nuclear

CE-17

Consumers
    Energy Company

decommissioning trust funds. This decrease was partially offset
    by an increase in capital expenditures primarily due to the
    purchase of the Zeeland power plant.

2006:

Net cash used in investing activities was
    $672 million, an increase of $11 million versus 2005.
    This increase was due to cash relinquished from the sale of
    assets, an increase in capital expenditures and cost to retire
    property and a decrease in net proceeds from investments. These
    changes were partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash
    and restricted short-term investments. Cash restricted in 2005
    was released in February 2006, which we used to extinguish
    long-term debt — related parties.

Financing
    Activities:

2007:

Net cash provided by financing activities was
    $301 million, an increase of $481 million versus 2006.
    This increase was primarily due to an increase of
    $450 million in contributions from the parent and a
    decrease in retirement of long-term debt. These changes were
    partially offset by an increase in common stock dividend
    payments of $104 million.

2006:

Net cash used in financing activities was
    $180 million, an increase of $447 million versus 2005.
    This increase was due to a decrease of $500 million in
    contributions from the parent and an increase in net retirement
    of long-term debt. These changes were partially offset by a
    decrease in common stock dividend payments of $130 million.

For additional details on long-term debt activity, see
    Note 4, Financings and Capitalization.

    facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These
    arrangements include indemnifications, surety bonds, letters of
    credit, and financial and performance guarantees.
    Indemnifications are usually agreements to reimburse a
    counterparty that may incur losses due to outside claims or
    breach of contract terms. The maximum amount of potential
    payments we would be required to make under a number of these
    indemnities is not estimable. We provide guarantees on behalf of
    certain non-consolidated entities, improving their ability to
    transact business. We monitor these obligations and believe it
    is unlikely that we will incur any material losses associated
    with these guarantees. For additional details on these
    arrangements, see Note 3, Contingencies, “Other
    Contingencies — Guarantees and
    Indemnifications

Sale of Accounts Receivable:

Under a revolving
    accounts receivable sales program, we may sell up to
    $325 million of certain accounts receivable. This program
    provides a lower cost source of funding compared with unsecured
    debt. For additional details, see Note 4, Financings and
    Capitalization.

Capital Expenditures:

For planning purposes, we
    forecast capital expenditures over a three-year period. We
    review these estimates and may revise them, periodically, due to
    a number of factors including environmental regulations,
    business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and
    the ability to access capital. The following is a summary of our
    estimated capital expenditures, including lease commitments, for
    2008 through 2010:

OUTLOOK

Corporate
    Outlook

Our business strategy will focus on continuing to invest in our
    utility system to enable us to meet our customer commitments, to
    comply with increasing environmental performance standards, and
    to maintain adequate supply and capacity.

ELECTRIC BUSINESS
    OUTLOOK

Growth:

In 2007, electric deliveries grew about one
    percent over 2006 levels. In 2008, we project electric
    deliveries to decline one-quarter of a percent compared to 2007
    levels. This outlook assumes a small decline in industrial
    economic activity, the cancellation of one wholesale customer
    contract, and normal weather conditions throughout the year.

We expect electric deliveries to grow one percent annually over
    the next five years. This outlook assumes a modestly growing
    customer base and a stabilizing Michigan economy after 2008.
    This growth rate, which reflects a long-range expected trend
    includes both full-service sales and delivery service to
    customers who choose to buy generation service from an
    alternative electric supplier, but excludes transactions with
    other wholesale market participants and other electric
    utilities. Growth from year to year may vary from this trend due
    to customer response to the following:

•

energy conservation measures,

•

fluctuations in weather conditions, and

•

changes in economic conditions, including utilization and
    expansion or contraction of manufacturing facilities.

Electric Customer Revenue Outlook:

Closures and
    restructuring of automotive manufacturing facilities and related
    suppliers and the sluggish housing market have hampered
    Michigan’s economy. The Michigan economy also has had
    facility closures in the non-manufacturing sector and limited
    growth. Although our electric utility results are not dependent
    upon a single customer, or even a few customers, those in the
    automotive sector represented five percent of our total 2007
    electric revenue. We cannot predict the financial impact of the
    Michigan economy on our electric customer revenue.

Electric Reserve Margin:

To reduce the risk of high
    power supply costs during peak demand periods and to achieve our
    Reserve Margin target, we purchase electric capacity and energy
    contracts for the physical delivery of electricity primarily in
    the summer months and to a lesser extent in the winter months.
    We have purchased capacity and energy contracts covering a
    portion of our Reserve Margin requirements for 2008 through
    2010. We are currently planning for a Reserve Margin of
    13.7 percent for summer 2008, or supply resources equal to
    113.7 percent of projected firm summer peak load. Of the
    2008 supply resources target, we expect 93 percent to come
    from our electric generating plants and long-term power purchase
    contracts, with other contractual arrangements making up the
    remainder. We expect capacity costs for these electric capacity
    and energy contracts to be $21 million for 2008.

In September 2007, we exercised the regulatory-out provision in
    the MCV PPA, thus limiting the amount we pay the MCV Partnership
    for capacity and fixed energy to the amount recoverable from our
    customers. The MCV Partnership may, under certain circumstances,
    have the right to terminate the MCV PPA, which could affect our
    Reserve Margin status. The MCV PPA represents approximately
    13 percent of our 2008 expected supply resources. For
    additional details, see “The MCV PPA” within this
    MD&A.

Electric Transmission Expenses:

In 2008, we expect
    transmission rates charged to us to increase by $42 million
    due primarily to a 33 percent increase in METC transmission
    rates. This increase was included in our 2008 PSCR plan filed
    with the MPSC in September 2007.

In September 2007, the FERC approved a proposal to include
    100 percent of the costs of network upgrades associated
    with new generator interconnections in the rates of certain MISO
    transmission owners, including METC.

CE-20

Consumers
    Energy Company

Previously, those transmission owners shared interconnection
    network upgrade costs with generators. Consumers, Detroit
    Edison, the MPSC, and other parties filed a request for
    rehearing of the FERC order.

21st Century Electric Energy Plan:

In January
    2007, the then chairman of the MPSC proposed initiatives to the
    governor of Michigan for the use of more renewable energy
    resources by all load-serving entities such as Consumers, the
    creation of an energy efficiency program, and a procedure for
    reviewing proposals to construct new generation facilities. The
    January proposal indicated that Michigan will need new base-load
    capacity by 2015. The proposed initiatives will require changes
    to current legislation.

Balanced Energy Initiative:

In response to the
    21st Century Electric Energy Plan, we filed with the MPSC a
    “Balanced Energy Initiative” that provides a
    comprehensive energy resource plan to meet our projected
    short-term and long-term electric power requirements. The filing
    requests the MPSC to rule that the Balanced Energy Initiative
    represents a reasonable and prudent plan for the acquisition of
    necessary electric utility resources. Implementation of the
    Balanced Energy Initiative will require legislative repeal or
    significant reform of the Customer Choice Act.

In September 2007, we filed with the MPSC an updated Balanced
    Energy Initiative, which includes our plan to build an
    800 MW advanced clean coal plant at our Karn/Weadock
    Generating complex near Bay City, Michigan. We expect to use
    500 MW of the plant’s output to serve Consumers’
    customers and to commit the remaining 300 MW to others. We
    expect the plant to begin operating in 2015. We estimate our
    share of the cost at $1.6 billion including financing
    costs. Construction of the proposed new clean coal plant is
    contingent upon obtaining environmental permits and MPSC
    approval.

The Michigan Attorney General filed a motion with the MPSC to
    dismiss the Balanced Energy Initiative case, claiming that the
    MPSC lacks jurisdiction over the matter, which the ALJ denied.
    The Michigan Attorney General and another intervenor have filed
    an appeal of that decision with the MPSC.

Proposed Energy Legislation:

There are various bills
    introduced and being considered in the U.S. Congress and
    the Michigan legislature relating to mandatory renewable energy
    standards. If enacted, these bills generally would require
    electric utilities either to acquire a certain percentage of
    their power from renewable sources or pay fees, or purchase
    allowances in lieu of having the resources. Also in December
    2007, several bills were introduced in the Michigan legislature
    that would reform the Customer Choice Act, introduce energy
    efficiency programs, modify the timing of rate increase
    requests, amend customer rate design and provide for other
    regulatory changes. We cannot predict whether any of these bills
    will be enacted or what form the final legislation might take.

Power Plant Purchase:

In December 2007, we purchased
    a 935 MW gas-fired power plant located in Zeeland, Michigan
    for $519 million from Broadway Gen Funding LLC, an
    affiliate of LS Power Group. The power plant will help meet the
    growing energy needs of our customers.

ELECTRIC BUSINESS
    UNCERTAINTIES

Several electric business trends and uncertainties may affect
    our financial condition and future results of operations. These
    trends and uncertainties have, had, or are reasonably expected
    to have, a material impact on revenues and income from
    continuing electric operations.

Electric Environmental Estimates:

Our operations are
    subject to various state and federal environmental laws and
    regulations. We have been able to recover our costs to operate
    our facilities in compliance with these laws and regulations in
    customer rates.

Clean Air Act:

Compliance with the federal Clean Air
    Act and resulting state and federal regulations continues to be
    a major focus for us. The State of Michigan’s Nitrogen
    Oxides Implementation Plan requires significant reductions in
    nitrogen oxides emissions. From 1998 to present, we have
    incurred $786 million in capital expenditures to comply
    with this plan, including installing selective catalytic
    reduction control technology on three of our coal-fired electric
    generating units. We have also installed low nitrogen oxides
    burners on a number of our coal-fired electric generating units.

CE-21

Consumers
    Energy Company

Clean Air Interstate Rule:

In March 2005, the EPA
    adopted the Clean Air Interstate Rule that requires additional
    coal-fired electric generating plant emission controls for
    nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. We plan to meet the nitrogen
    oxides requirements by:

•

operating our selective catalytic reduction control technology
    units throughout the year,

•

completing the installation of a fourth selective catalytic
    reduction control unit,

•

installing low nitrogen oxides burners, and

•

purchasing emission allowances.

We plan to meet the sulfur dioxide requirements by injecting a
    chemical that reduces sulfur dioxide emissions, installing
    scrubbers and purchasing emission allowances. We plan to spend
    an additional $835 million for equipment installation
    through 2015, which we expect to recover in customer rates. The
    key assumptions in the capital expenditure estimate include:

•

construction commodity prices, especially construction material
    and labor,

•

project completion schedules and spending plans,

•

cost escalation factor used to estimate future years’ costs
    of 3.2 percent, and

•

an AFUDC capitalization rate of 7.9 percent.

We will need to purchase additional nitrogen oxides emission
    allowances through 2011 at an estimated cost of $3 million
    per year. We will also need to purchase additional sulfur
    dioxide emission allowances in 2012 and 2013 at an estimated
    cost of $10 million per year. We expect to recover
    emissions allowance costs from our customers through the PSCR
    process.

The Clean Air Interstate Rule was appealed to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by a
    number of utilities and other companies. A decision is expected
    in 2008. We cannot predict the outcome of these appeals.

State and Federal Mercury Air Rules:

In March 2005,
    the EPA issued the CAMR, which requires initial reductions of
    mercury emissions from coal-fired electric generating plants by
    2010 and further reductions by 2018. Certain portions of the
    CAMR were appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    District of Columbia by a number of states and other entities.
    The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    decided the case on February 8, 2008, and determined that
    the rules developed by the EPA were not consistent with the
    Clean Air Act. We continue to monitor the development of federal
    regulations in this area.

In April 2006, Michigan’s governor proposed a plan that
    would result in mercury emissions reductions of 90 percent
    by 2015. We are working with the MDEQ on the details of this
    plan; however, we have developed preliminary cost estimates and
    a mercury emissions reduction scenario based on our best
    knowledge of control technology options and initially proposed
    requirements. We estimate that costs associated with Phase I of
    the state’s mercury plan will be approximately
    $280 million by 2010 and an additional $200 million by
    2015. The key assumptions in the capital expenditure estimate
    are the same as those stated for the Clean Air Interstate Rule.

The following table outlines the proposed state mercury plan:

Phase I

Phase II

Proposed State Mercury Rule

30% reduction by 2010

90% reduction by 2015

Routine Maintenance Classification:

The EPA has
    alleged that some utilities have incorrectly classified plant
    modifications as “routine maintenance” rather than
    seeking permits from the EPA to modify their plants. We
    responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject
    in 2000, 2002, and 2006. We believe that we have properly
    interpreted the requirements of “routine maintenance.”
    If the EPA finds that our interpretation is incorrect, we could
    be required to install additional pollution controls at some or
    all of our coal-fired electric generating plants and pay fines.
    Additionally, we would need to assess the viability of
    continuing operations at certain plants. We cannot predict the
    financial impact or outcome of this issue.

CE-22

Consumers
    Energy Company

Greenhouse Gases:

Several legislative proposals have
    been introduced in the United States Congress that would require
    reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon
    dioxide. These laws, or similar state laws or rules, if enacted
    could require us to replace equipment, install additional
    equipment for pollution controls, purchase allowances, curtail
    operations, or take other steps. Although associated capital or
    operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or
    legislation could be material, and cost recovery cannot be
    assured, we expect to have an opportunity to recover these costs
    and capital expenditures in rates consistent with the recovery
    of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws
    and regulations.

To the extent that greenhouse gas emission reduction rules come
    into effect, the mandatory emissions reduction requirements
    could have far-reaching and significant implications for the
    energy sector. We cannot estimate the effect of federal or state
    greenhouse gas policy on our future consolidated results of
    operations, cash flows, or financial position due to the
    uncertain nature of the policies. However, we will continue to
    monitor greenhouse gas policy developments and assess and
    respond to their potential implications for our business
    operations.

Water:

In March 2004, the EPA issued rules that
    govern electric generating plant cooling water intake systems.
    The rules require significant reduction in the number of fish
    harmed by operating equipment. EPA compliance options in the
    rule were challenged in court. In January 2007, the court
    rejected many of the compliance options favored by industry and
    remanded the bulk of the rule back to the EPA for
    reconsideration. The court’s ruling is expected to increase
    significantly the cost of complying with this rule. However, the
    cost to comply will not be known until the EPA’s
    reconsideration is complete. At this time, the EPA is developing
    rules to implement the court’s decision. The rules are
    expected to be released for public comment in late 2008.

For additional details on electric environmental matters, see
    Note 3, Contingencies, “Electric
    Contingencies — Electric Environmental Matters.”

Electric ROA:

The Customer Choice Act allows all of
    our electric customers to buy electric generation service from
    us or from an alternative electric supplier. At
    December 31, 2007, alternative electric suppliers were
    providing 315 MW of generation service to ROA customers.
    This is 4 percent of our total distribution load and
    represents an increase of 5 percent of ROA load compared to
    December 31, 2006.

In November 2004, the MPSC issued an order allowing us to
    recover Stranded Costs incurred in 2002 and 2003 through a
    surcharge applied to ROA customers. Since the MPSC order, we
    have experienced a downward trend in ROA customers. If this
    trend continues, it may require legislative or regulatory
    assistance to recover fully our 2002 and 2003 Stranded Costs.

Electric Rate Case:

During 2007, we filed
    applications with the MPSC seeking an 11.25 percent
    authorized return on equity and an annual increase in revenues
    of $269 million. The filings sought recovery of the costs
    associated with increased plant investment, including the
    purchase of the Zeeland power plant, increased equity
    investment, higher operation and maintenance expenses, recovery
    of transaction costs from the sale of Palisades, and the
    approval of an energy efficiency program.

In December 2007, the MPSC approved a rate increase of
    $70 million related to the purchase of the Zeeland power
    plant. For additional details and material changes relating to
    the restructuring of the electric utility industry and electric
    rate matters, see Note 3, Contingencies, “Electric
    Rate Matters.”

The MCV PPA:

The MCV Partnership, which leases and
    operates the MCV Facility, contracted to sell electricity to
    Consumers for a

35-year

period beginning in 1990. In September 2007, we exercised the
    regulatory-out provision in the MCV PPA, thus limiting the
    amount we pay the MCV Partnership for capacity and fixed energy
    to the amount recoverable from our customers. The MCV
    Partnership has notified us that it disputes our right to
    exercise the regulatory-out provision. We believe that the
    provision is valid and fully effective and have not recorded any
    reserves, but we cannot predict whether we would prevail in the
    event of litigation on this issue.

As a result of our exercise of the regulatory-out provision, the
    MCV Partnership may, under certain circumstances, have the right
    to terminate the MCV PPA or reduce the amount of capacity sold
    under the MCV PPA. If the MCV Partnership terminates or reduces
    the amount of capacity sold under the MCV PPA, we will

CE-23

Consumers
    Energy Company

seek to replace the lost capacity to maintain an adequate
    electric Reserve Margin. This could involve entering into a new
    power purchase agreement and (or) entering into electric
    capacity contracts on the open market. We cannot predict whether
    we could enter into such contracts at a reasonable price. We are
    also unable to predict whether we would receive regulatory
    approval of the terms and conditions of such contracts, or
    whether the MPSC would allow full recovery of our incurred costs.

To comply with a prior MPSC order, we made a filing in May 2007
    with the MPSC requesting a determination as to whether it wished
    to reconsider the amount of the MCV PPA payments that we recover
    from customers. In May 2007, the MCV Partnership also filed an
    application with the MPSC seeking approval to increase our
    recovery of costs incurred under the MCV PPA. We cannot predict
    the financial impact or outcome of these matters. For additional
    details on the MCV PPA, see Note 3, Contingencies,
    “Other Electric Contingencies — The MCV PPA.”

Sale of Nuclear Assets:

In April 2007, we sold
    Palisades to Entergy for $380 million and received
    $363 million after various closing adjustments. We also
    paid Entergy $30 million to assume ownership and
    responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI. In addition, we paid the
    NMC, the former operator of Palisades, $7 million in exit
    fees and forfeited our $5 million investment in the NMC.
    The MPSC order approving the Palisades transaction allowed us to
    recover the book value of Palisades. As a result, we are
    crediting proceeds in excess of book value of $66 million
    to our customers through the end of 2008. After closing
    adjustments, which are subject to MPSC review, proceeds in
    excess of the book value were $77 million. Recovery of our
    transaction costs of $28 million, which includes the NMC
    exit fees and investment forfeiture, is presently under review
    by the MPSC in our current electric rate case.

Entergy assumed responsibility for the future decommissioning of
    Palisades and for storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at
    Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI sites. We transferred
    $252 million in trust fund assets to Entergy. We are
    crediting excess decommissioning funds of $189 million to
    our retail customers through the end of 2008. Modification to
    the terms of the transaction allowed us immediate access to
    additional excess decommissioning trust funds of
    $123 million. The distribution of these funds is currently
    under review by the MPSC in our electric rate case filing. For
    additional details on the sale of Palisades and the Big Rock
    ISFSI, see Note 2, Asset Sales and Impairment Charges.

As part of the transaction, we entered into a

15-year

power purchase agreement under which Entergy sells us all of the
    plant’s output up to its current annual average capacity of
    798 MW. Because of the Palisades power purchase agreement
    and our continuing involvement with the Palisades assets, we
    accounted for the disposal of Palisades as a financing for
    accounting purposes and not a sale. For additional details on
    the Palisades financing, see Note 10, Leases.

GAS BUSINESS
    OUTLOOK

Growth:

In 2008, we project that gas deliveries will
    remain flat, on a weather-adjusted basis, relative to 2007
    levels due to continuing conservation and overall economic
    conditions in Michigan. We expect gas deliveries to decline by
    less than one-half of one percent annually over the next five
    years. Actual gas deliveries in future periods may be affected
    by:

•

fluctuations in weather conditions,

•

use by independent power producers,

•

availability of renewable energy sources,

•

changes in gas commodity prices,

•

Michigan economic conditions,

•

the price of competing energy sources or fuels,

•

gas consumption per customer, and

•

improvements in gas appliance efficiency.

GAS BUSINESS
    UNCERTAINTIES

Several gas business trends and uncertainties may affect our
    future financial results and financial condition. These trends
    and uncertainties could have a material impact on future
    revenues and income from gas operations.

Gas Environmental Estimates:

We expect to incur
    investigation and remedial action costs at a number of sites,
    including 23 former manufactured gas plant sites. For additional
    details, see Note 3, Contingencies, “Gas Contingencies
    - Gas Environmental Matters.”

Gas Cost Recovery:

The GCR process is designed to
    allow us to recover all of our purchased natural gas costs if
    incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.
    The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices for
    prudency in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. For
    additional details on GCR, see Note 3, Contingencies,
    “Gas Rate Matters — Gas Cost Recovery.”

Gas Depreciation:

In June 2007, the MPSC issued its
    final order in a generic ARO accounting case and modified the
    filing requirement for our next gas depreciation case. The
    original filing requirement date was changed from 90 days
    after the issuance of that order to no later than August 1,
    2008. Additionally, we have been ordered to use 2007 data and
    prepare a cost-of-removal depreciation study with five
    alternatives using the MPSC’s prescribed methods. We cannot
    predict the outcome of the analysis.

If a final order in our next gas depreciation case is not issued
    concurrently with a final order in a general gas rate case, the
    MPSC may incorporate the results of the depreciation case into
    general gas rates through a surcharge, which may be either
    positive or negative.

2007 Gas Rate Case:

In February 2007, we filed an
    application with the MPSC seeking an 11.25 percent
    authorized return on equity as part of an $88 million
    annual increase in our gas delivery and transportation rates. In
    August 2007, the MPSC approved a partial settlement agreement
    authorizing an annual rate increase of $50 million,
    including an authorized return on equity of 10.75 percent.
    On September 25, 2007, the MPSC reopened the record in the
    case to allow all interested parties to be heard concerning the
    approval of an energy efficiency program, which we proposed in
    our original filing. Hearings on this matter were held in
    February 2008. We expect the MPSC to issue a final order in the
    second quarter of 2008. If approved in total, this would result
    in an additional rate increase of $9 million for
    implementation of the energy efficiency program.

2008 Gas Rate Case:

In February 2008, we filed an
    application with the MPSC for an annual gas rate increase of
    $91 million and an 11 percent authorized return on
    equity.

OTHER
    OUTLOOK

Advanced Metering Infrastructure:

We are developing
    an advanced meter system that will provide more frequent
    information about our customer energy usage and notification of
    service interruptions. The system will allow customers to make
    decisions about energy efficiency and conservation, provide
    other customer benefits, and reduce costs. We anticipate
    developing integration software and piloting new technology over
    the next two years. We expect capital expenditures for this
    project over the next seven years to be approximately
    $800 million. Over the long-term, we do not expect this
    project to significantly impact rates.

Software Implementation:

We are implementing an
    integrated business software system for finance,
    purchasing/supply chain, customer billing, human resources and
    payroll, and utility asset construction and maintenance work
    management. We expect the new business software, scheduled to be
    in production in the first half of 2008, to improve customer
    service, reduce risk, and increase flexibility. Including work
    done to date, we expect to incur $175 million in operating
    expenses and capital expenditures for the initial implementation.

Michigan Public Service Commission:

During the third
    quarter of 2007, the Michigan governor appointed a new MPSC
    chairperson and a new MPSC commissioner. We have several
    significant cases pending MPSC review and approval. For

    investigation by the DOJ. For additional details regarding this
    investigation and litigation, see Note 3, Contingencies.

Michigan Tax Legislation:

In July 2007, the Michigan
    governor signed Senate Bill 94, the Michigan Business Tax Act,
    which imposed a business income tax of 4.95 percent and a
    modified gross receipts tax of 0.8 percent. The bill
    provided for a number of tax credits and incentives geared
    toward those companies investing and employing in Michigan. The
    Michigan Business Tax, which was effective January 1, 2008,
    replaced the state’s Single Business Tax that expired on
    December 31, 2007. In September 2007, the Michigan governor
    signed House Bill 5104, allowing additional deductions in future
    years against the business income portion of the tax. These
    future deductions are phased in over a

15-year

period, beginning in 2015. As a result, our net deferred tax
    liability of $165 million, recorded due to the Michigan
    Business Tax enactment, was offset by a net deferred tax asset
    of $165 million. In December 2007, the Michigan governor
    signed House Bill 5408, replacing the expanded sales tax for
    certain services with a 21.99 percent surcharge on the
    business income tax and the modified gross receipts tax.
    Therefore, the total tax rates imposed under the Michigan
    Business Tax are 6.04 percent for the business income tax
    and 0.98 percent for the modified gross receipts tax. We
    expect to recover the taxes that we pay from our customers, but
    we cannot predict the timeliness of such recovery.

Implementation
    of New Accounting Standards

SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R):

In September 2006, the FASB
    issued SFAS No. 158. Phase one of this standard,
    implemented in December 2006, required us to recognize the
    funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006. Phase two
    requires that we change our plan measurement date from November
    30 to December 31, effective for the year ending
    December 31, 2008. The implementation of phase two of this
    standard will not have a material effect on our consolidated
    financial statements.

FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes:

This interpretation, which we adopted on
    January 1, 2007, provides a two-step approach for the
    recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken, or
    expected to be taken, by a company on its income tax returns.
    The first step is to evaluate the tax position to determine if,
    based on management’s best judgment, it is greater than
    50 percent likely that we will sustain the tax position.
    The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the
    benefit to recognize. This is done by estimating the potential
    outcomes and recognizing the greatest amount that has a
    cumulative probability of at least 50 percent. FIN 48
    requires interest and penalties, if applicable, to be accrued on
    differences between tax positions recognized in our consolidated
    financial statements and the amount claimed, or expected to be
    claimed, on the tax return.

Consumers joins in the filing of a consolidated
    U.S. federal income tax return as well as unitary and
    combined income tax returns in several states. Consumers and its
    subsidiaries also file separate company income tax returns in
    several states. The only significant state tax paid by Consumers
    or any of its subsidiaries is in Michigan. However, since the
    Michigan Single Business Tax was not an income tax, it was not
    part of the FIN 48 analysis. The IRS has completed its
    audits for all the consolidated federal returns, of which
    Consumers is a member, for years through 2001. The federal
    income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2006 are open
    under the statute of limitations, with 2002 through 2005
    currently under examination.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recorded a
    charge for additional uncertain tax benefits of $5 million,
    accounted for as a reduction of our beginning retained earnings.
    Included in this amount was an increase in our valuation
    allowance of $7 million, increases to tax reserves of $55
    million and a decrease to deferred tax liabilities of $57
    million. Since all our remaining uncertain tax benefits relate
    only to timing issues, at December 31, 2007, there are no
    uncertain benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate in
    future years. We are not expecting any other material changes to
    our uncertain tax positions over the next twelve months.

CE-26

Consumers
    Energy Company

Due to the consolidated net operating loss position, we have
    reflected no interest related to our uncertain income tax
    positions on our Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007, nor
    have we accrued any penalties. We recognize accrued interest and
    penalties, where applicable, related to uncertain tax benefits
    as part of income tax expense.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET EFFECTIVE

SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements:

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 157, effective for us on January 1,
    2008. The standard provides a revised definition of fair value
    and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Under the
    standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
    orderly exchange between market participants. The standard does
    not expand the use of fair value, but it requires new
    disclosures about the impact and reliability of fair value
    measurements. The standard will also eliminate the existing
    prohibition against recognizing “day one” gains and
    losses on derivative instruments. We currently do not hold any
    derivatives that would involve day one gains or losses. The
    standard is to be applied prospectively, except that limited
    retrospective application is required for three types of
    financial instruments, none of which we currently hold. We do
    not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2008, the FASB issued a one-year deferral of
    SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities, except those that are recorded or disclosed at fair
    value on a recurring basis. Under this partial deferral,
    SFAS No. 157 will not be effective until
    January 1, 2009 for fair value measurements in the
    following areas:

•

AROs,

•

most of the nonfinancial assets and liabilities acquired in a
    business combination, and

•

fair value measurements performed in conjunction with impairment
    analyses.

SFAS No. 157 remains effective January 1, 2008
    for our derivative instruments, available-for-sale investment
    securities, and long-term debt fair value disclosures.

SFAS No. 159, The

Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an
    amendment to FASB Statement No. 115:

In
    February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, effective
    for us on January 1, 2008. This standard gives us the
    option to measure certain financial instruments and other items
    at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in
    earnings. We do not expect to elect the fair value option for
    any financial instruments or other items.

SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB
    No. 51:

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 160, effective for us January 1, 2009.
    Ownership interests in subsidiaries held by third parties, which
    are currently referred to as minority interests, will be
    presented as noncontrolling interests and shown separately on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets within equity. Any changes in
    our ownership interests while control is retained will be
    treated as equity transactions. In addition, this standard
    requires presentation and disclosure of the allocation between
    controlling and noncontrolling interests’ income from
    continuing operations, discontinued operations, and
    comprehensive income and a reconciliation of changes in the
    consolidated statement of equity during the reporting period.
    The presentation and disclosure requirements of the standard
    will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. All
    other requirements will be applied prospectively. We are
    evaluating the impact SFAS No. 160 will have on our
    consolidated financial statements.

EITF Issue

06-11,

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards:

In June 2007, the FASB
    ratified EITF Issue

06-11,

effective for us on a prospective basis beginning
    January 1, 2008. EITF Issue

06-11

requires companies to recognize, as an increase to additional
    paid-in capital, the income tax benefit realized from dividends
    or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings
    and paid to employees for non-vested equity-classified employee
    share-based payment awards. We do not believe that
    implementation of this standard will have a material effect on
    our consolidated financial statements.

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES
    TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1: CORPORATE
    STRUCTURE AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Corporate Structure:

Consumers, a subsidiary of CMS
    Energy, a holding company, is a combination electric and gas
    utility company serving Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Our
    customer base includes a mix of residential, commercial, and
    diversified industrial customers. We manage our business by the
    nature of services each provides and operate principally in two
    business segments: electric utility and gas utility.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated
    financial statements include Consumers, and all other entities
    in which we have a controlling financial interest or are the
    primary beneficiary, in accordance with FIN 46(R). We use
    the equity method of accounting for investments in companies and
    partnerships that are not consolidated, where we have
    significant influence over operations and financial policies,
    but are not the primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany
    transactions and balances.

Use of Estimates:

We prepare our consolidated
    financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We are
    required to make estimates using assumptions that may affect the
    reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

We record estimated liabilities for contingencies in our
    consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a
    liability was incurred and when the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. For additional details, see Note 3,
    Contingencies.

Revenue Recognition Policy:

We recognize revenues
    from deliveries of electricity and natural gas, and from the
    storage of natural gas when services are provided. We record
    unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energy delivered
    to customers but not yet billed. We record sales tax on a net
    basis and exclude it from revenues.

Accounting for Legal Fees:

We expense legal fees as
    incurred; fees incurred but not yet billed are accrued based on
    estimates of work performed. This policy also applies to fees
    incurred on behalf of employees and officers related to
    indemnification agreements; such fees are billed directly to us.

Accounting for MISO Transactions:

MISO requires that
    we submit hourly day-ahead and real-time bids and offers for
    energy at locations across the MISO region. We account for MISO
    transactions on a net hourly basis in each of the real-time and
    day-ahead markets, and net transactions across all MISO energy
    market locations. We record net purchases in a single hour in
    “Purchased and interchange power” and net sales in a
    single hour in “Operating Revenue” in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income (Loss). We record expense accruals for
    future net purchases adjustments based on historical experience,
    and reconcile accruals to actual expenses when we receive
    invoices.

Capitalized Interest:

We capitalize interest on
    certain qualifying assets that are undergoing activities to
    prepare them for their intended use. Capitalization of interest
    is limited to the actual interest cost incurred. Our regulated
    businesses capitalize AFUDC on regulated construction projects
    and include these amounts in plant in service.

Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:

Cash
    equivalents are all liquid investments with an original maturity
    of three months or less.

At December 31, 2007, our restricted cash on hand was
    $25 million. We classify restricted cash dedicated for
    repayment of Securitization bonds as a current asset, as the
    related payments occur within one year.

Collective Bargaining Agreements:

At
    December 31, 2007, the Utility Workers of America Union
    represented approximately 46 percent of our employees. The
    Union represents Consumers’ operating, maintenance, and
    construction employees and our call center employees.

Determination of Pension MRV of Plan Assets:

We
    determine the MRV for pension plan assets, as defined in
    SFAS No. 87, as the fair value of plan assets on the
    measurement date, adjusted by the gains or losses that will not

CE-37

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

be admitted into MRV until future years. We reflect each
    year’s assets gain or loss in MRV in equal amounts over a
    five-year period beginning on the date the original amount was
    determined. We use the MRV in the calculation of net pension
    cost.

Financial and Derivative Instruments:

We record debt
    and equity securities classified as available-for-sale at fair
    value determined primarily from quoted market prices. On a
    specific identification basis, we report unrealized gains and
    losses from changes in fair value of certain available-for-sale
    debt and equity securities, net of tax, in equity as part of
    AOCI. We exclude unrealized losses from earnings unless the
    related changes in fair value are determined to be other than
    temporary. We reflected unrealized gains and losses on our
    nuclear decommissioning investments as regulatory liabilities on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In accordance with SFAS No. 133, if a contract is a
    derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and
    sales exception, it is recorded on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets at its fair value. If a derivative qualifies for cash
    flow hedge accounting, we report changes in its fair value in
    AOCI; otherwise, we report the changes in earnings.

For additional details regarding financial and derivative
    instruments, see Note 5, Financial and Derivative
    Instruments.

Impairment of Investments and Long-Lived Assets:

We
    periodically perform tests of impairment if certain triggering
    events occur, or if there has been a decline in value that may
    be other than temporary.

A long-lived asset

held-in-use

is evaluated for impairment by calculating the undiscounted
    future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
    and its eventual disposition. If the undiscounted future cash
    flows are less than the carrying amount, we recognize an
    impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount
    exceeds the fair value. We estimate the fair value of the asset
    using quoted market prices, market prices of similar assets, or
    discounted future cash flow analyses.

We also assess our investments for impairment whenever there has
    been a decline in value that is other than temporary. This
    assessment requires us to determine the fair values of our
    investments. We determine fair value using valuation
    methodologies, including discounted cash flows and the ability
    of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies
    the carrying amount of the investment. We record an impairment
    if the fair value is less than the carrying value and the
    decline in value is considered to be other than temporary.

For additional details, see Note 2, Asset Sales and
    Impairment Charges.

Inventory:

We use the weighted average cost method
    for valuing working gas and recoverable cushion gas in
    underground storage facilities and materials and supplies
    inventory. We also use this method for valuing coal inventory
    and classify these costs as generating plant fuel stock on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We classify emission allowances as materials and supplies
    inventory and use the average cost method to remove amounts from
    inventory as the emission allowances are used to generate power.

Maintenance and Depreciation:

We charge property
    repairs and minor property replacement to maintenance expense.
    We use the direct expense method to account for planned major
    maintenance activities. We charge planned major maintenance
    activities to operating expense unless the cost represents the
    acquisition of additional components or the replacement of an
    existing component. We capitalize the cost of plant additions
    and replacements.

We depreciate utility property using a composite method, in
    which we apply a single MPSC-approved depreciation rate to the
    gross investment in a particular class of property within the
    electric and gas divisions. We

Property, Plant, and Equipment:

We record property,
    plant, and equipment at original cost when placed into service.
    When regulated assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of in
    the ordinary course of business, we charge the original cost to
    accumulated depreciation, along with associated cost of removal,
    net of salvage. We recognize gains or losses on the retirement
    or disposal of non-regulated assets in income. For additional
    details, see Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations and
    Note 11, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Cost of removal
    collected from our customers, but not spent, is recorded as a
    regulatory liability.

We capitalize AFUDC on regulated major construction projects.
    AFUDC represents the estimated cost of debt and a reasonable
    return on equity funds used to finance construction additions.
    We record the offsetting credit of AFUDC capitalized as a
    reduction of interest for the amount representing the borrowed
    funds component and as other income for the equity funds
    component in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). When
    construction is completed and the property is placed in service,
    we depreciate and recover the capitalized AFUDC from our

Trade Receivables:

Accounts receivable is primarily
    composed of trade receivables and unbilled receivables. We
    record our accounts receivable at cost which approximates fair
    value. Unbilled receivables were $490 million in 2007 and
    $355 million in 2006. We establish an allowance for
    uncollectible accounts based on historical losses and
    management’s assessment of existing economic conditions,
    customer trends, and other factors. We assess late payment fees
    on trade receivables based on contractual past-due terms
    established with customers. We charge accounts deemed
    uncollectible to operating expense.

Unamortized Debt Premium, Discount, and Expense:

We
    capitalize premiums, discounts, and costs of long-term debt and
    amortize those costs over the terms of the debt issues. For the
    non-regulated portions of our businesses, we expense any
    refinancing costs as incurred. For the regulated portions of our
    businesses, if we refinance debt, we capitalize any remaining
    unamortized premiums, discounts, and expenses and amortize them
    over the terms of the newly issued debt.

Utility Regulation:

We are subject to the actions of
    the MPSC and FERC and prepare our consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 71. As a result, we may defer or recognize
    revenues and expenses differently than a non-regulated entity.
    For example, we may record as regulatory assets items that a
    non-regulated entity normally would expense if the actions of
    the regulator indicate such expenses will be recovered in future
    rates. Conversely, we may record as regulatory liabilities items
    that non-regulated entities may normally recognize as revenues
    if the actions of the regulator indicate they will require that
    such revenues be refunded to customers.

We reflect the following regulatory assets and liabilities,

    beginning in June 2007 through December 2008. The current
    portion of regulatory liabilities for Palisades refunds
    represents the remaining portion of this obligation, plus
    interest. There are additional excess sales proceeds and
    decommissioning fund balances above the amount in the MPSC
    order. The non-current portion of regulatory liabilities for
    Palisades refunds represents this obligation, plus interest. For

New Accounting Standards Not Yet
    Effective:

SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
    Measurements:

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 157, effective for us on January 1,
    2008. The standard provides a revised definition of fair value
    and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Under the
    standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
    orderly exchange between market participants. The standard does
    not expand the use of fair value, but it requires new
    disclosures about the impact and reliability of fair value
    measurements. The standard will also eliminate the existing
    prohibition against recognizing “day one” gains and
    losses on derivative instruments. We currently do not hold any
    derivatives that would involve day one gains or losses. The
    standard is to be applied prospectively, except that limited
    retrospective application is required for three types of
    financial instruments, none of which we currently hold. We do
    not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2008, the FASB issued a one-year deferral of
    SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities, except those that are recorded or disclosed at fair
    value on a recurring basis. Under this partial deferral,
    SFAS No. 157 will not be effective until
    January 1, 2009 for fair value measurements in the
    following areas:

•

AROs,

•

most of the nonfinancial assets and liabilities acquired in a
    business combination, and

•

fair value measurements performed in conjunction with impairment
    analyses.

SFAS No. 157 remains effective January 1, 2008
    for our derivative instruments, available-for-sale investment
    securities, and long-term debt fair value disclosures.

SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial
    Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment to FASB
    Statement No. 115:

In February 2007, the FASB
    issued SFAS No. 159, effective for us on
    January 1, 2008. This standard gives us the option to
    measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair
    value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. We do
    not expect to elect the fair value option for any financial
    instruments or other items.

SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB
    No. 51:

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 160, effective for us January 1, 2009.
    Ownership interests in subsidiaries held by third parties, which
    are currently referred to as minority interests, will be
    presented as noncontrolling interests and shown separately on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets within equity. Any changes in
    our ownership interests while control is retained will be
    treated as equity transactions. In addition, this standard
    requires presentation and disclosure of the allocation between
    controlling and noncontrolling interests’ income from
    continuing operations, discontinued operations, and
    comprehensive income and a reconciliation of changes in the
    consolidated statement of equity during the reporting period.
    The presentation and disclosure requirements of the standard
    will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. All
    other requirements will be applied prospectively. We are
    evaluating the impact SFAS No. 160 will have on our
    consolidated financial statements.

    or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings

Sale of Nuclear Assets:

In April 2007, we sold
    Palisades to Entergy for $380 million, and received
    $363 million after various closing adjustments such as
    working capital and capital expenditure adjustments and nuclear
    fuel usage and inventory adjustments. We also paid Entergy
    $30 million to assume ownership and responsibility for the
    Big Rock ISFSI. Because of the sale of Palisades, we paid the
    NMC, the former operator of Palisades, $7 million in exit
    fees and forfeited our $5 million investment in the NMC.

Entergy assumed responsibility for the future decommissioning of
    Palisades and for storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel
    located at Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI sites. At closing,
    we transferred $252 million in decommissioning trust fund
    balances to Entergy. We are presently crediting excess
    decommissioning funds,

CE-43

CONSUMERS ENERGY

which totaled $189 million to our retail customers through
    the end of 2008. Modification to the terms of the transaction
    allowed us immediate access to additional excess decommissioning
    trust funds of $123 million. The distribution of these
    funds is currently under review by the MPSC in our electric rate
    case filing. We have recorded this obligation, plus interest, as
    a regulatory liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The MPSC order approving the Palisades transaction allows us to
    recover the book value of Palisades. As a result, we are
    presently crediting proceeds in excess of book value of
    $66 million to our retail customers through the end of
    2008. After closing adjustments, which are subject to MPSC
    review, proceeds in excess of the book value were
    $77 million. We recorded the excess proceeds as a
    regulatory liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    Recovery of our transaction costs of $28 million, which
    includes the NMC exit fees and investment forfeiture, is
    presently under review by the MPSC in our current electric rate
    case. We recorded these costs as a regulatory asset on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as recovery is probable.

We accounted for the disposal of Palisades as a financing for
    accounting purposes and thus we recognized no gain on the
    Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). We accounted for the
    remaining non-real estate assets and liabilities associated with
    the transaction as a sale. For additional details on the
    Palisades finance obligation, see Note 10, Leases.

We sold 36 parcels of land near Ludington, Michigan. We held a

    Our portion of the proceeds was $6 million.

(b)

In November 2006, we sold all of our interests in the
    Consumers’ subsidiaries that held the MCV Partnership and
    the MCV Facility to an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners and
    Rockland Capital Energy Investments.

Because of the MCV PPA, the transaction is a sale and leaseback
    for accounting purposes. SFAS No. 98 specifies the
    accounting required for a seller’s sale and simultaneous
    leaseback involving real estate. We have continuing involvement
    with the MCV Partnership through an existing guarantee
    associated with the future operations of the MCV Facility. As a
    result, we accounted for the MCV Facility as a financing for
    accounting purposes and not a sale. The value of the finance
    obligation was based on an allocation of the transaction
    proceeds to the fair values of the net assets sold and fair
    value of the MCV Facility under the financing. The total
    proceeds of $61 million (excluding $3 million of
    selling expenses) were less than the fair value of the net
    assets sold. As a result, there were no proceeds remaining to
    allocate to the MCV Facility; therefore, we recorded no finance
    obligation.

The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of
    $41 million, which includes a reclassification of
    $30 million of AOCI into earnings, an $80 million
    impairment charge on the MCV Facility, an $8 million gain
    on the removal of our interests in the MCV Partnership and the
    MCV Facility, and $1 million benefit in general taxes. Upon
    the sale of our interests in the MCV Partnership and the FMLP,
    we were no longer the primary beneficiary of these entities and
    the entities were deconsolidated.

Impairment
    Charges

In November 2006, we recorded an impairment charge of
    $218 million to recognize the reduction in fair value of
    the MCV Facility’s real estate assets. The result was an
    $80 million reduction to our consolidated net income after
    considering tax effects and minority interest.

CE-44

CONSUMERS ENERGY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

In the third quarter of 2005, based on forecasts for higher
    natural gas prices, the MCV Partnership determined an impairment
    analysis considering revised forward natural gas price
    assumptions was required. The MCV Partnership determined the
    fair value of its fixed assets by discounting a set of
    probability-weighted streams of future operating cash flows. The
    carrying value of the MCV Partnership’s fixed assets
    exceeded the estimated fair value resulting in impairment
    charges of $1.159 billion to recognize the reduction in
    fair value of the MCV Facility’s fixed assets and
    $25 million of interest capitalized during the construction
    of the MCV Facility. Our 2005 consolidated net income was
    reduced by $385 million, after considering tax effects and
    minority interest.

We report our interests in the MCV Partnership as a component of
    our “other” business segment.

CONTINGENCIES

DOJ Investigation:

From May 2000 through January
    2002, CMS MST engaged in simultaneous, prearranged commodity
    trading transactions in which energy commodities were sold and
    repurchased at the same price. These transactions referred to as
    round-trip trades, had no impact on previously reported
    consolidated net income, earnings per share or cash flows, but
    had the effect of increasing operating revenues and operating
    expenses by equal amounts. CMS Energy is cooperating with an
    investigation by the DOJ concerning round-trip trading, which
    the DOJ commenced in May 2002. CMS Energy is unable to predict
    the outcome of this matter and what effect, if any, this
    investigation will have on its business.

SEC Investigation and Settlement:

In March 2004, the
    SEC approved a

cease-and-desist

order settling an administrative action against CMS Energy
    related to round-trip trading. The order did not assess a fine
    and CMS Energy neither admitted to nor denied the order’s
    findings. The settlement resolved the SEC investigation
    involving CMS Energy and CMS MST. Also in March 2004, the SEC
    filed an action against three former employees related to
    round-trip trading at CMS MST. One of the individuals has
    settled with the SEC. CMS Energy is currently advancing legal
    defense costs for the remaining two individuals in accordance
    with existing indemnification policies. The two individuals
    filed a motion to dismiss the SEC action, which was denied.

Securities Class Action Settlement:

Beginning
    in May 2002, a number of complaints were filed against CMS
    Energy, Consumers and certain officers and directors of CMS
    Energy and its affiliates in the United States District Court
    for the Eastern District of Michigan. The cases were
    consolidated into a single lawsuit (the “Shareholder
    Action”), which generally seeks unspecified damages based
    on allegations that the defendants violated United States
    securities laws and regulations by making allegedly false and
    misleading statements about CMS Energy’s business and
    financial condition, particularly with respect to revenues and
    expenses recorded in connection with round-trip trading by CMS
    MST. In January 2005, the court granted a motion to dismiss
    Consumers and three of the individual defendants, but denied the
    motions to dismiss CMS Energy and the 13 remaining individual
    defendants. In March 2006, the court conditionally certified a
    class consisting of “all persons who purchased CMS Common
    Stock during the period of October 25, 2000 through and
    including May 17, 2002 and who were damaged thereby.”
    The court excluded purchasers of CMS Energy’s
    8.75 percent Adjustable Convertible
    Trust Securities (“ACTS”) from the class and, in
    response, a new class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of ACTS
    purchasers (the “ACTS Action”) against the same
    defendants named in the Shareholder Action. The settlement
    described in the following paragraph has resolved both the
    Shareholder and ACTS Actions.

On January 3, 2007, CMS Energy and other parties entered
    into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”),
    subject to court approval, regarding settlement of the two class
    action lawsuits. The settlement was approved by a special
    committee of independent directors and by the full Board of
    Directors. Both judged that it was in the best interests of
    shareholders to eliminate this business uncertainty. Under the
    terms of the MOU, the litigation was settled for a total of
    $200 million, including the cost of administering the
    settlement and any attorney fees the court awards. CMS Energy
    made a payment of approximately $123 million plus interest
    on the settlement amount on September 20, 2007. CMS
    Energy’s insurers paid $77 million, the balance of the
    settlement amount. In entering into the MOU, CMS Energy made no
    admission of liability under the Shareholder Action and the ACTS
    Action. The

CE-45

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

parties executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement dated
    May 22, 2007 (“Stipulation”) incorporating the
    terms of the MOU. In accordance with the Stipulation, CMS Energy
    paid approximately $1 million of the settlement amount to
    fund administrative expenses. On September 6, 2007, the
    court issued a final order approving the settlement. The
    remaining settlement amount was paid following the
    September 6, 2007 hearing.

Katz Technology Litigation:

In June 2007, RAKTL
    filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the
    Eastern District of Michigan against CMS Energy and Consumers
    alleging patent infringement. RAKTL claimed that automated
    customer service, bill payment services and gas leak reporting
    offered to our customers and accessed through toll free numbers
    infringe on patents held by RAKTL. On January 15, 2008,
    Consumers and CMS Energy reached an agreement in principle with
    RAKTL to settle the litigation. We expect to finalize the terms
    of the settlement and license by late February 2008. We believe
    any settlement with RAKTL will be immaterial.

Electric
    Contingencies

Electric Environmental Matters:

Our operations are
    subject to environmental laws and regulations. Generally, we
    have been able to recover the costs to operate our facilities in
    compliance with these laws and regulations in customer rates.

Cleanup and Solid Waste:

Under the NREPA, we will
    ultimately incur investigation and response activity costs at a
    number of sites. We believe that these costs will be recoverable
    in rates under current ratemaking policies.

We are a potentially responsible party at a number of
    contaminated sites administered under the Superfund. Superfund
    liability is joint and several. However, many other creditworthy
    parties with substantial assets are potentially responsible with
    respect to the individual sites. Based on our experience, we
    estimate that our share of the total liability for most of our
    known Superfund sites will be between $1 million and
    $10 million. At December 31, 2007, we have recorded a
    liability for the minimum amount of our estimated probable
    Superfund liability in accordance with FIN 14.

The timing of payments related to our investigation and response
    activities at our Superfund and NREPA sites is uncertain. Any
    significant change in assumptions, such as different remediation
    techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and legal and
    regulatory requirements, could affect our estimate of response
    activity costs and the timing of our payments.

Ludington PCB:

In October 1998, during routine
    maintenance activities, we identified PCB as a component in
    certain paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington. We
    removed and replaced part of the PCB material with non-PCB
    material. Since proposing a plan to deal with the remaining
    materials, we have had several conversations with the EPA. The
    EPA has proposed a rule that would allow us to leave the
    material in place, subject to certain restrictions. We are not
    able to predict when the EPA will issue a final ruling. We
    cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Electric Utility Plant Air Permit Issues:

In April
    2007, we received a Notice of Violation (NOV) /Finding of
    Violation (FOV) from the EPA alleging that fourteen of our
    utility boilers exceeded visible emission limits in their
    associated air permits. The utility boilers are located at the
    D.E. Karn/J.C. Weadock Generating Complex, J.H. Campbell Plant,
    B.C. Cobb Electric Generating Station and J.R. Whiting Plant,
    which are all located in Michigan. We have formally responded to
    the NOV/FOV denying the allegations and are awaiting the
    EPA’s response to our submission. We cannot predict the
    financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Litigation:

In 2003, a group of eight PURPA
    qualifying facilities (the plaintiffs) filed a lawsuit in Ingham
    County Circuit Court. The lawsuit alleged that we incorrectly
    calculated the energy charge payments made under power purchase
    agreements. The judge deferred to the primary jurisdiction of
    the MPSC, dismissing the circuit court case without prejudice.
    In February 2005, the MPSC issued an order in the 2004 PSCR plan
    case concluding

CE-46

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

that we have been correctly administering the energy charge
    calculation methodology. The plaintiffs have an appeal of the
    MPSC order pending with the Court of Appeals. We believe we have
    been performing the calculation in the manner prescribed by the
    power purchase agreements and have not recorded any reserves. We
    cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Electric
    Rate Matters

Electric ROA:

The Customer Choice Act allows
    electric utilities to recover their net Stranded Costs. In
    November 2004, the MPSC approved recovery of our Stranded Costs
    incurred from 2002 through 2003 plus interest through the period
    of collection. At December 31, 2007, we had a regulatory
    asset for Stranded Costs of $68 million. We collect these
    Stranded Costs through a surcharge on ROA customers. At
    December 31, 2007, alternative electric suppliers were
    providing 315 MW of generation service to ROA customers,
    which represents an increase of 5 percent of ROA load
    compared to December 31, 2006. However, since the MPSC
    order, we have experienced a downward trend in ROA customers.
    This trend has affected negatively our ability to recover these
    Stranded Costs in a timely manner. If this trend continues, it
    may require legislative or regulatory assistance to recover
    fully our 2002 and 2003 Stranded Costs.

Power Supply Costs:

The PSCR process allows recovery
    of reasonable and prudent power supply costs. The MPSC reviews
    these costs for reasonableness and prudency in annual plan
    proceedings and in plan reconciliation proceedings. The
    following table summarizes our PSCR reconciliation filings with
    the MPSC:

$99 million as recommended by a February 2008 ALJ Proposal for
    Decision. In a separate matter, this ALJ also recommended that
    we refund $62 million in proceeds from the sale of excess
    sulfur dioxide allowances. In accordance with FERC regulations,
    we previously reserved these proceeds as a regulatory liability
    pending final direction on disposition of the proceeds from the
    MPSC.

2007 PSCR Plan:

In December 2006, the MPSC issued a
    temporary order allowing us to implement our 2007 PSCR monthly
    factor on January 1, 2007, as filed. The order also allowed
    us to include prior year underrecoveries and overrecoveries in
    future PSCR plans. In September 2007, the ALJ recommended in his
    Proposal for Decision that we reduce our underrecoveries to
    reflect the refund of all proceeds from the sale of sulfur
    dioxide allowances,

CE-47

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

which totaled $62 million. Our PSCR plan proposed to refund
    50 percent of proceeds to customers. We reserved all
    proceeds, excluding interest, as a regulatory liability as
    discussed in the preceding paragraph.

2008 PSCR Plan

: In September 2007, we submitted our 2008
    PSCR plan filing to the MPSC. The plan proposed recovery of
    estimated 2007 PSCR underrecoveries of $84 million. We
    self-implemented a 2008 PSCR charge in January 2008.

We expect to recover fully all of our PSCR costs. When we
    are unable to collect these costs as they are incurred, there is
    a negative impact on our cash flows from electric utility
    operations. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    these proceedings.

Electric Rate Case:

In 2007, we filed applications
    with the MPSC seeking an 11.25 percent authorized return on
    equity and an annual increase in revenues of $269 million.
    We presently have an authorized return on equity of
    11.15 percent. In July 2007, we filed an amended
    application for rate relief, which seeks the following:

•

recovery of the purchase of the Zeeland power plant,

•

approval to remove the costs associated with Palisades,

•

approval of a plan for the distribution of additional excess
    proceeds from the sale of Palisades to customers, effectively
    offsetting the partial and immediate rate relief for up to nine
    months, and

•

partial and immediate rate relief associated with 2007 capital
    investments, a $400 million equity infusion into Consumers,
    and increased distribution system operation and maintenance
    costs including employee pension and health care costs.

In December 2007, the MPSC approved a rate increase of
    $70 million related to the purchase of the Zeeland power
    plant. The MPSC also stated that our interim request that sought
    the removal of costs associated with Palisades and the approval
    of a plan to distribute excess proceeds from the sale of
    Palisades to customers should be addressed in the final electric
    rate case order. Furthermore, the MPSC denied our request for
    the approval of partial and immediate rate relief associated
    with capital investments, changes in the capital structure, and
    increased operation and maintenance expenses.

When we are unable to include increased costs and investments in
    rates in a timely manner, there is a negative impact on our cash
    flows from electric utility operations. We cannot predict the
    financial impact or the outcome of this proceeding.

Other
    Electric Contingencies

The MCV PPA:

The MCV Partnership, which leases and
    operates the MCV Facility, contracted to sell 1,240 MW of
    electricity to Consumers under a

35-year

power purchase agreement that began in 1990. We estimate that
    capacity and energy payments under the MCV PPA, excluding RCP
    savings, will range from $650 million to $750 million
    annually, assuming successful exercise of the regulatory-out
    provision in the MCV PPA. We purchased capacity and energy, net
    of the MCV RCP replacement energy and benefits, under the MCV
    PPA of $464 million in 2007, $411 million in 2006, and
    $352 million in 2005.

Regulatory-out Provision in the MCV PPA:

Until we
    exercised the regulatory-out provision in the MCV PPA in
    September 2007, the cost that we incurred under the MCV PPA
    exceeded the recovery amount allowed by the MPSC. The
    regulatory-out provision limits our capacity and fixed energy
    payments to the MCV Partnership to the amounts that we collect
    from our customers. Cash underrecoveries of our capacity and
    fixed energy payments were $39 million in 2007. Savings
    from the RCP, after allocation of a portion to customers, offset
    some of our capacity and fixed energy underrecoveries expense.

CE-48

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

As a result of our exercise of the regulatory-out provision, the
    MCV Partnership may, under certain circumstances, have the right
    to terminate the MCV PPA, or reduce the amount of capacity sold
    under the MCV PPA from 1,240 MW to 806 MW, which could
    affect our electric Reserve Margin. The MCV Partnership has
    until February 25, 2008 to notify us of its intention to
    terminate the MCV PPA, at which time the MCV Partnership must
    specify the termination date. We have not yet received any
    notification of termination; however, the MCV Partnership has
    notified us that it disputes our right to exercise the
    regulatory-out provision. We believe that the provision is valid
    and fully effective and have not recorded any reserves, but we
    cannot predict whether we would prevail in the event of
    litigation on this issue.

We expect the MPSC to review our exercise of the regulatory-out
    provision and the likely consequences of such action. It is
    possible that in the event that the MCV Partnership terminates
    performance under the MCV PPA, prior orders could limit recovery
    of replacement power costs to the amounts that the MPSC
    authorized for recovery under the MCV PPA. Depending on the cost
    of replacement power, this could result in our costs exceeding
    the recovery amount allowed by the MPSC. We cannot predict the
    financial impact or outcome of these matters.

To comply with a prior MPSC order, we made a filing in May 2007
    with the MPSC requesting a determination as to whether it wished
    to reconsider the amount of the MCV PPA payments that we recover
    from customers. The MCV Partnership also filed an application
    with the MPSC requesting the elimination of the
    88.7 percent availability cap on the amount of capacity and
    fixed energy charges that we are allowed to recover from our
    customers. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of
    these matters.

Nuclear Matters:

Big Rock Decommissioning:

The MPSC and the FERC regulate the recovery of costs to
    decommission Big Rock. In December 2000, funding of the Big Rock
    trust fund stopped because the MPSC-authorized decommissioning
    surcharge collection period expired. The level of funds provided
    by the trust fell short of the amount needed to complete
    decommissioning. As a result, we provided $45 million of
    corporate contributions for decommissioning costs. This amount
    excludes the $30 million payment to Entergy to assume
    ownership and responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI and
    additional corporate contributions for nuclear fuel storage
    costs of $54 million, due to the DOE’s failure to
    accept spent nuclear fuel on schedule. We plan to seek recovery
    from the MPSC for decommissioning and other related expenditures
    and we have a $129 million regulatory asset recorded on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Cost:

We deferred payment for
    disposal of spent nuclear fuel burned before April 7, 1983.
    Our DOE liability is $159 million at December 31,
    2007. This amount includes interest, which is payable upon the
    first delivery of spent nuclear fuel to the DOE. We recovered,
    through electric rates, the amount of this liability, excluding
    a portion of interest. In conjunction with the sale of Palisades
    and the Big Rock ISFSI, we retained this obligation and provided
    a $155 million letter of credit to Entergy as security for
    this obligation.

DOE Litigation:

In 1997, a U.S. Court of
    Appeals decision confirmed that the DOE was to begin accepting
    deliveries of spent nuclear fuel for disposal by January 1998.
    Subsequent U.S. Court of Appeals litigation, in which we
    and other utilities participated, has not been successful in
    producing more specific relief for the DOE’s failure to
    accept the spent nuclear fuel.

A number of court decisions support the right of utilities to
    pursue damage claims in the United States Court of Claims
    against the DOE for failure to take delivery of spent nuclear
    fuel. We filed our complaint in December 2002. If our litigation
    against the DOE is successful, we plan to use any recoveries as
    reimbursement for the incurred costs of spent nuclear fuel
    storage during our ownership of Palisades and Big Rock. We
    cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.
    The sale of Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI did not transfer
    the right to any recoveries from the DOE related to costs of
    spent nuclear fuel storage incurred during our ownership of
    Palisades and Big Rock.

Gas
    Contingencies

Gas Environmental Matters:

We expect to incur
    investigation and remediation costs at a number of sites under
    the Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act,
    a Michigan statute that covers environmental activities
    including remediation. These sites include 23 former
    manufactured gas plant facilities. We operated the facilities on
    these sites for some part of their operating lives. For some of
    these sites, we have no current ownership or may own only a
    portion of the original site. In December 2005, we estimated our
    remaining costs to be between $29 million and
    $71 million, based on 2005 discounted costs, using a
    discount rate of three percent. The discount rate represented a

10-year

average of U.S. Treasury bond rates reduced for increases
    in the consumer price index. We expect to fund most of these
    costs through proceeds from insurance settlements and
    MPSC-approved rates.

From January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2007, we spent a
    total of $12 million for MGP response activities. At
    December 31, 2007, we have a liability of $17 million
    and a regulatory asset of $50 million, which includes
    $33 million of deferred MGP expenditures. The timing of
    payments related to the remediation of our manufactured gas
    plant sites is uncertain. Annual response activity costs are
    expected to range between $4 million and $6 million
    per year over the next five years. Any significant change in
    assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites,
    different remediation techniques, nature and extent of
    contamination, and legal and regulatory requirements, could
    affect our estimate of response activity costs and the timing of
    our payments.

Gas Title Transfer Tracking Fees and
    Services:

In November 2007, we reached an agreement in
    principle with Duke Energy Corporation, Dynegy Incorporated,
    Reliant Energy Resources Incorporated and FERC Staff to settle
    the TTT proceeding. The terms of the agreement include the
    payment of $2 million in total refunds to all TTT customers
    and a reduced rate for future TTT transactions.

FERC Investigation:

In February 2008, Consumers
    received a data request relating to an investigation the FERC is
    conducting into possible violations of the FERC’s posting
    and competitive bidding regulations related to releases of firm
    capacity on natural gas pipelines. Consumers will cooperate with
    the FERC in responding to the request. Consumers cannot predict
    the financial impact or outcome of this matter.

Gas
    Rate Matters

Gas Cost Recovery:

The GCR process is designed to
    allow us to recover all of our purchased natural gas costs if
    incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.
    The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices for
    prudency in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings.

2005 through March 2006. We were able to maintain our GCR
    billing factor below the authorized level for that period. The
    order was appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals by one
    intervenor. In January 2008, the Michigan Court of Appeals
    affirmed the MPSC’s order for our

2005-2006

GCR plan for year

2006-2007:

In
    August 2006, the MPSC issued an order for our

GCR Plan year. The order approved a settlement agreement that
    allowed a base GCR ceiling factor of $9.48 per mcf for April
    2006 through March 2007. We were able to maintain our GCR
    billing factor below the authorized level for that period.

GCR plan for year

2007-2008:

In
    July 2007, the MPSC issued an order for our

2007-2008

GCR plan year. The order approved a settlement agreement that
    allowed a base GCR ceiling factor of $8.47 per mcf for April
    2007 through March 2008, subject to a quarterly ceiling price
    adjustment mechanism. To date, we have been able to maintain our
    GCR billing factor below the authorized level.

The GCR billing factor is adjusted monthly in order to minimize
    the over- or underrecovery amounts in our annual GCR
    reconciliation. Our GCR billing factor for February 2008 is
    $7.69 per mcf.

GCR plan for year

2008-2009:

In
    December 2007, we filed an application with the MPSC seeking
    approval of a GCR plan for our

2008-2009

GCR Plan year. Our request proposed the use of a GCR factor
    consisting of:

•

a base GCR ceiling factor of $8.17 per mcf, plus

•

a quarterly GCR ceiling price adjustment contingent upon future
    events.

2007 Gas Rate Case:

In February 2007, we filed an
    application with the MPSC seeking an 11.25 percent
    authorized return on equity as part of an $88 million
    annual increase in our gas delivery and transportation rates. In
    August 2007, the MPSC approved a partial settlement agreement
    authorizing an annual rate increase of $50 million,
    including an authorized return on equity of 10.75 percent.
    In September  2007, the MPSC reopened the record in the
    case to allow all interested parties to be heard concerning the
    approval of an energy efficiency program, which we proposed in
    our original filing. Hearings on this matter were held in
    February 2008. We expect the MPSC to issue a final order in the
    second quarter of 2008. If approved in total, this would result
    in an additional rate increase of $9 million for
    implementation of the energy efficiency program.

2008 Gas Rate Case:

In February 2008, we filed an
    application with the MPSC for an annual gas rate increase of
    $91 million and an 11 percent authorized return on
    equity.

agreed to pay us $85 million, subject to certain
    reimbursement rights, if Dow terminates the agreement under
    which the MCV Partnership provides it steam and electric power.
    This agreement expires in March 2016, subject to certain terms
    and conditions. The purchaser secured its reimbursement
    obligation with an irrevocable letter of credit of up to
    $85 million. At December 31, 2007, the guarantee
    liability recorded for surety bonds and indemnities and for the
    guarantee to provide power and steam to Dow was immaterial.

We enter into various agreements containing tax and other
    indemnification provisions in connection with a variety of
    transactions. While we are unable to estimate the maximum
    potential obligation related to these indemnities, we consider
    the likelihood that we would be required to perform or incur
    significant losses related to these indemnities and the
    guarantees listed in the preceding tables to be remote.

    arising from the ordinary course of business. These lawsuits and
    proceedings may involve personal injury, property damage,
    contractual matters, environmental issues, federal and state
    taxes, rates, licensing, and other matters.

We have accrued estimated losses for certain contingencies

Securitization Bonds:

Certain regulatory assets
    collateralize securitization bonds. The bondholders have no
    recourse to our other assets. Through our rate structure, we
    bill customers for securitization surcharges to fund the payment

Regulatory Authorization for Financings:

The FERC
    has authorized us to issue up to $1.0 billion of secured
    and unsecured short-term securities for general corporate
    purposes. The remaining availability is $500 million at
    December 31, 2007.

The FERC has also authorized us to issue up to $2.5 billion
    of secured and unsecured long-term securities for the following:

•

up to $1.5 billion of new issuance for general corporate
    purposes and

•

up to $1.0 billion for purposes of refinancing or refunding
    existing long-term debt.

All of the new issuance availability remains ($1.5 billion)
    and the refinancing availability remaining is $500 million
    at December 31, 2007.

The authorizations are for the period ending June 30, 2008.
    Any long-term issuances during the authorization period are
    exempt from FERC’s competitive bidding and negotiated
    placement requirements.

Dividend Restrictions:

Under the provisions of our
    articles of incorporation, at December 31, 2007, we had
    $269 million of unrestricted retained earnings available to
    pay common stock dividends. Provisions of the Federal Power Act
    and the Natural Gas Act effectively restrict dividends to the
    amount of our retained earnings. During 2007, we paid
    $251 million in common stock dividends to CMS Energy.

Sale of Accounts Receivable:

Under a revolving
    accounts receivable sales program, we sell certain accounts
    receivable to a wholly owned, consolidated, bankruptcy-remote
    special-purpose entity. In turn, the special purpose entity may
    sell an undivided interest in up to $325 million of the
    receivables. The special purpose entity sold no receivables at
    December 31, 2007 and $325 million at
    December 31, 2006. The purchaser of the receivables has no
    recourse against our other assets for failure of a debtor to pay
    when due and no right to any receivables not sold. We have
    neither recorded a gain or loss on the receivables sold nor
    retained any interest in the receivables sold. We continue to
    service the receivables sold to the special purpose entity. We
    have not recorded a servicing asset in connection with our
    accounts receivable sales program.

5: FINANCIAL
    AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Financial Instruments:

The carrying amounts of cash,
    short-term investments, and current liabilities approximate
    their fair values because of their short-term nature. We
    estimate the fair values of long-term financial instruments
    based on quoted market prices or, in the absence of specific
    market prices, on quoted market prices of similar instruments or
    other valuation techniques.

During 2007, the proceeds from sales of SERP securities were
    $29 million, and $11 million of gross gains and
    $1 million of gross losses were realized. Net gains of
    $7 million, net of tax of $3 million, were
    reclassified from AOCI and included in net income. The proceeds
    from sales of SERP securities were $3 million during 2006
    and $2 million during 2005. Gross gains and losses were
    immaterial in 2006 and 2005.

Derivative Instruments:

In order to limit our
    exposure to certain market risks, we may enter into various risk
    management contracts, such as swaps, options, and forward
    contracts. These contracts, used primarily to limit our exposure
    to changes in interest rates and commodity prices, are entered
    into for non-trading purposes. We enter into these contracts
    using established policies and procedures, under the direction
    of two different committees: an executive oversight committee
    consisting of senior management representatives and a risk
    committee consisting of business unit managers.

The contracts we use to manage market risks may qualify as
    derivative instruments that are subject to derivative and hedge
    accounting under SFAS No. 133. If a contract is a
    derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and
    sales exception under SFAS No. 133, it is recorded on
    our consolidated balance sheet at its fair value. Each quarter,
    we adjust the resulting asset or liability to reflect any change
    in the fair value of the contract, a practice known as marking
    the contract to market. If a derivative qualifies for cash flow
    hedge accounting treatment, we report changes in its fair value
    (gains or losses) in AOCI; otherwise, we report the gains and
    losses in earnings.

Most of our commodity purchase and sale contracts are not
    subject to derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133
    because:

•

they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units
    specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity
    or bcf of natural gas),

CE-56

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

•

they qualify for the normal purchases and sales
    exception, or

•

there is not an active market for the commodity.

Our coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is
    not an active market for the coal we purchase. If an active
    market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts
    may qualify as derivatives. Under regulatory accounting, the
    resulting mark-to-market gains and losses would be offset by
    changes in regulatory assets and liabilities and would not
    affect net income.

At December 31, 2007, the fair value of our derivative
    contracts was immaterial.

6: RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

We provide retirement benefits to our employees under a number
    of different plans, including:

•

a non-contributory, qualified defined benefit Pension Plan
    (closed to new non-union participants as of July 1, 2003
    and closed to new union participants as of September 1,
    2005),

•

a qualified cash balance Pension Plan for certain employees
    hired between July 1, 2003 and August 31, 2005,

•

a non-contributory, qualified DCCP for employees hired on or
    after September 1, 2005,

•

benefits to certain management employees under a
    non-contributory, nonqualified defined benefit SERP (closed to
    new participants as of March 31, 2006),

•

benefits to certain management employees under a
    non-contributory, nonqualified DC SERP hired on or after
    April 1, 2006,

•

health care and life insurance benefits under OPEB,

•

benefits to a selected group of management under a
    non-contributory, nonqualified EISP, and

•

a contributory, qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan.

Pension Plan:

The Pension Plan includes funds for
    most of our current employees, the employees of our
    subsidiaries, and Panhandle, a former subsidiary. The Pension
    Plan’s assets are not distinguishable by company.

In April 2007, we sold Palisades to Entergy. Employees
    transferred to Entergy as a result of the sale no longer
    participate in our retirement benefit plans. We recorded a net
    decrease of $16 million in pension SFAS No. 158
    regulatory assets with a corresponding reduction of
    $16 million in pension liabilities on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. We also recorded a net decrease of
    $15 million in OPEB regulatory SFAS No. 158
    assets with a corresponding reduction of $15 million in
    OPEB liabilities. The following table shows the net adjustment:

On September 1, 2005, we implemented the DCCP. The DCCP
    provides an employer contribution of 5 percent of base pay
    to the existing employees’ 401(k) plan. No employee
    contribution is required in order to receive the plan’s
    employer contribution. All employees hired on and after
    September 1, 2005 participate in this plan. Cash balance
    pension plan participants also participate in the DCCP as of
    September 1, 2005. Additional pay credits under the cash
    balance pension plan were discontinued as of that date. The DCCP
    expense was $2 million for each of the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006.

SERP:

SERP benefits are paid from a trust
    established in 1988. SERP is not a qualified plan under the
    Internal Revenue Code. SERP trust earnings are taxable and trust
    assets are included in our consolidated assets. Consumers trust
    assets were $53 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $32 million at December 31, 2006. The assets are
    classified as Other non-current assets on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The ABO for SERP was $48 million at
    December 31, 2007 and $37 million at December 31,
    2006. A contribution of $21 million was made to the trust
    in December 2007.

On April 1, 2006, we implemented a DC SERP and froze
    further new participation in the defined benefit SERP. The DC
    SERP provides participants benefits ranging from 5 percent
    to 15 percent of total compensation. The DC SERP requires a
    minimum of five years of participation before vesting. Our
    contributions to the plan, if any, will be placed in a grantor
    trust. Trust assets were less than $1 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006. The assets are classified as
    Other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
    DC SERP expense was less than $1 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

401(k):

The employer’s match for the 401(k)
    savings plan is 60 percent on eligible contributions up to
    the first six percent of an employee’s wages. The total
    401(k) savings plan cost was $14 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006.

Beginning May 1, 2007, the CMS Energy Common Stock Fund was
    no longer an investment option available for investments in the
    401(k) savings plan and the employer match was no longer in CMS
    Energy Common Stock. Participants had an opportunity to
    reallocate investments in the CMS Energy Common Stock Fund to
    other plan investment alternatives prior to November 1,
    2007. In November 2007, the remaining shares in the CMS Energy
    Common Stock Fund were sold and the sale proceeds were
    reallocated to other plan investment options.

EISP:

We implemented a nonqualified EISP in 2002 to
    provide flexibility in separation of employment by officers, a
    selected group of management, or other highly compensated
    employees. Terms of the plan may include payment of a lump sum,
    payment of monthly benefits for life, payment of premiums for
    continuation of health care, or any other legally permissible
    term deemed to be in our best interest to offer. The EISP
    expense was less than $1 million for each of the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The ABO for the EISP was
    $1 million at December 31, 2007 and less than
    $1 million at December 31, 2006.

OPEB:

The OPEB plan covers all regular full-time
    employees who are covered by the employee health care plan on a
    company-subsidized basis the day before they retire from the
    company at age 55 or older and who have at least 10 full
    years of applicable continuous service. Regular full-time
    employees who qualify for a pension plan disability retirement
    and have 15 years of applicable continuous service are also
    eligible. Starting in 2007, we used two health care trend rates:
    one for retirees under 65 and the other for retirees 65 and
    over. The two health care trend rates recognize that
    prescription drug costs are increasing at a faster pace than
    other medical claim costs and that prescription drug costs make
    up a larger portion of expenses for retirees age 65 and
    over. Retiree health care costs were based on the assumption
    that costs would increase 9.0 percent for those under 65
    and 10.5 percent for those over 65 in 2007. The 2008 rate
    of increase for OPEB health costs for those under 65 is expected
    to be 8.0 percent and for those over 65 is expected to be
    9.5 percent. The rate of increase is expected to slow to
    5 percent for those under 65 by 2011 and for those over 65
    by 2013 and thereafter.

The health care cost trend rate assumption affects the estimated
    costs recorded. A one percentage point change in the assumed
    health care cost trend assumption would have the following
    effects:

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 106, at the beginning of
    1992, we recorded a liability of $466 million for the
    accumulated transition obligation and a corresponding regulatory
    asset for anticipated recovery in utility rates. For additional
    details, see Note 1, Corporate Structure and Accounting
    Policies, “Utility Regulation.” The MPSC authorized
    recovery of the electric utility portion of these costs in 1994
    over 18 years and the gas utility portion in 1996 over
    16 years.

SFAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R):

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 158. This standard requires us to recognize
    the funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006.
    SFAS No. 158 also requires us to recognize changes in
    the funded status of our plans in the year in which the changes
    occur. In addition, the standard requires that we change our
    plan measurement date from November 30 to December 31,
    effective December 31, 2008. We do not believe that
    implementation of this provision of the standard will have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

(b)

We determine our long-term rate of return by considering
    historical market returns, the current and expected future
    economic environment, the capital market principles of risk and
    return, and the expert opinions of individuals and firms with
    financial market knowledge. We consider the asset allocation of

forecasting the future expected total return of the portfolio.
    The goal is to determine a long-term rate of return that can be
    incorporated into the planning of future cash flow requirements
    in conjunction with the change in the liability. Annually, we
    review for reasonableness and appropriateness of the forecasted
    returns for various classes of assets used to construct an
    expected return model.

(a)

Regulatory adjustments are the differences between amounts
    included in rates and the periodic benefit cost calculated
    pursuant to SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106.
    These adjustments are deferred as a regulatory asset and will be
    included in future rate cases. The pension regulatory asset had
    a balance of $33 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $11 million at December 31, 2006. The OPEB regulatory
    asset had a balance of $8 million at December 31, 2007
    and $2 million at December 31, 2006.

The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined
    benefit pension plans that will be amortized into net periodic
    benefit cost over the next fiscal year from the regulatory asset
    is $43 million. The estimated net loss and

CE-60

    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

prior service credit for OPEB plans that will be amortized into
    net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year from the
    regulatory asset is zero.

We amortize gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the
    greater of the benefit obligation and the MRV over the average
    remaining service period. The estimated time of amortization of
    gains and losses is 13 years for pension and 14 years
    for OPEB. Prior service cost amortization is established in the
    years in which they first occur, and are based on the same
    amortization period in all future years until fully recognized.
    The estimated time of amortization of new prior service costs is
    13 years for pension and 11 years for OPEB.

    contributed to the VEBA trust accounts. We contributed
    $103 million to our Pension Plan in 2007 and we do not plan
    to contribute to our Pension Plan in 2008.

We established a target asset allocation for our Pension Plan
    assets of 60 percent equity, 30 percent fixed income,
    and 10 percent alternative strategy investments to maximize
    the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent
    level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the
    liabilities of the plan. Equity investments are diversified
    mostly across the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
    with lesser allocations to the Standard & Poor’s
    Mid Cap and Small Cap Indexes and Foreign Equity Funds.
    Fixed-income investments are diversified across investment grade
    instruments of both government and corporate issuers as well as
    high-yield and global bond funds. Alternative strategies are
    diversified across absolute return investment approaches and
    global tactical asset allocation. We use annual liability
    measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic
    asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to
    the portfolio allocation.

We established union and non-union VEBA trusts to fund our
    future retiree health and life insurance benefits. These trusts
    are funded through the ratemaking process for Consumers, and
    through direct contributions from the

non-utility subsidiaries. We invest the equity portions of the
    union and non-union health care VEBA trusts in a
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fund. We invest the
    fixed-income portion of the union health care VEBA trust in
    domestic investment grade taxable instruments. We invest the
    fixed-income portion of the non-union health care VEBA trust in
    a diversified mix of domestic tax-exempt securities. The
    investment selections of each VEBA trust are influenced by the
    tax consequences, as well as the objective of generating asset
    returns that will meet the medical and life insurance costs of
    retirees.

7: ASSET
    RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations

:

This standard requires us to record
    the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their
    useful lives, if there is a legal obligation to remove them. No
    market risk premium was included in our ARO fair value estimate
    since a reasonable estimate could not be made. If a five percent
    market risk premium were assumed, our ARO liability at
    December 31, 2007 would increase by $10 million.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the
    period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with
    indeterminate lives, the liability is to be recognized when a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Historically, our
    gas transmission and electric and gas distribution assets have
    indeterminate lives and retirement cash flows that cannot be
    determined. During 2007, however, we implemented a new fixed
    asset accounting system that facilitates ARO accounting
    estimates for gas distribution mains and services. The new
    system enabled us to calculate a reasonable estimate of the fair
    value of the cost to cut, purge, and cap abandoned gas
    distribution mains and services at the end of their useful
    lives. We recorded a $101 million ARO liability and an
    asset of equal value at December 31, 2007. We have not
    recorded a liability for assets that have insignificant
    cumulative disposal costs, such as substation batteries.

FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations:

This
    Interpretation clarified the term “conditional asset
    retirement obligation” used in SFAS No. 143. The
    term refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement
    activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are
    conditional on a future event. We determined that abatement of
    asbestos included in our plant investments and the cut, purge,
    and cap of abandoned gas distribution mains and services qualify
    as conditional AROs, as defined by FIN 47.

8: INCOME
    TAXES

We join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax
    return with CMS Energy and its subsidiaries. Income taxes
    generally are allocated based on each company’s separate
    taxable income in accordance with the CMS Energy tax sharing
    agreement. We had tax related payables to CMS Energy of
    $154 million in 2007 and $31 million in 2006.

We utilize deferred tax accounting for temporary differences.
    These occur when there are differences between the book and tax
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. ITC has been
    deferred and is being amortized over the estimated service life
    of related properties. We use ITC to reduce current income taxes
    payable.

AMT paid generally becomes a tax credit that we can carry
    forward indefinitely to reduce regular tax liabilities in future
    periods when regular taxes paid exceed the tax calculated for
    AMT. At December 31, 2007, we had AMT credit carryforwards
    of $13 million that do not expire and tax loss
    carryforwards of $196 million that expire from 2023 through
    2025. In addition, we had a capital loss carryforward of
    $6 million that expires in 2011. We do not believe that
    valuation allowances are required, as we expect to fully utilize
    the loss carryforwards prior to their expiration. In addition,
    we recorded a benefit of $253 million for a future Michigan
    deduction, offset by a federal tax benefit of $88 million,
    for a net benefit of $165 million. This future deduction
    was granted as part of the Michigan Business Tax legislation of
    2007, discussed within this Note.

The significant components of income tax expense (benefit)

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits
    by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which can result
    in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome
    for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe
    that our accrued tax liabilities at December 31, 2007 are
    adequate for all years.

In June 2006, the IRS concluded its most recent audit of CMS
    Energy and its subsidiaries, and adjusted taxable income for the
    years ended December 31, 1987 through December 31,
    2001. The overall cumulative increase to taxable income related
    primarily to the disallowance of the simplified service cost
    method with respect to certain self-constructed utility assets,
    resulting in a deferral of these expenses to future periods. The
    adjustments to taxable income have been allocated based upon
    Consumers’ separate taxable income in accordance with CMS
    Energy’s tax sharing agreement. We made a payment to CMS
    Energy for our share of these audit adjustments of
    $232 million, and reduced our 2006 income tax provision by
    $19 million, primarily for the restoration and utilization
    of previously written off income tax credits. The years 2002
    through 2006 are open under the statute of limitations and 2002
    through 2005 are currently under audit by the IRS.

On January 1, 2007 we adopted the provisions of FASB
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes

. As a result of the implementation of
    FIN 48, we recorded a charge for additional uncertain tax
    benefits of $5 million, accounted for as a reduction of our
    beginning retained earnings. Included in this amount was an
    increase in our valuation allowance of $7 million,
    increases to tax reserves of $55 million and a decrease to
    deferred tax liabilities of $57 million. The capital gains
    of 2007 provided for the release of $23 million of
    valuation allowance, as reflected in our effective tax rate
    reconciliation.

Balance at December 31, 2007

$


The balance of $41 million is attributable to tax positions
    for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for
    which there is uncertainty about the timing of such
    deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
    the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not
    affect the annual effective tax rate. Since all our remaining
    uncertain tax benefits relate only to timing issues, at
    December 31, 2007, there are no uncertain benefits that
    would reduce our effective tax rate in future years. We are not
    expecting any other material changes to our uncertain tax
    positions over the next twelve months.

Due to the consolidated net operating loss position, we have
    reflected no interest related to our uncertain income tax
    positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    December 31, 2007, nor have we accrued any penalties. We
    recognize accrued interest and penalties, where applicable,
    related to uncertain tax benefits as part of income tax expense.

Michigan Business Tax Act:

In July 2007, the
    Michigan governor signed Senate Bill 94, the Michigan Business
    Tax Act, which imposed a business income tax of
    4.95 percent and a modified gross receipts tax of
    0.8 percent. The bill provided for a number of tax credits
    and incentives geared toward those companies investing and
    employing in Michigan. The Michigan Business Tax, which was
    effective January 1, 2008, replaced the state’s Single
    Business Tax that expired on December 31, 2007. In
    September 2007, the Michigan governor signed House Bill 5104,
    allowing additional deductions in future years against the
    business income portion of the tax. These future deductions are
    phased in over a

15-year

period, beginning in 2015. As a result, our net deferred tax
    liability of $165 million, recorded due to the Michigan
    Business Tax enactment, was offset by a net deferred tax asset
    of $165 million. In December 2007, the Michigan governor
    signed House Bill 5408, replacing the expanded sales tax for
    certain services with a 21.99 percent surcharge on the
    business income tax and the modified gross receipts tax.
    Therefore, the total tax rates imposed under the Michigan
    Business Tax are 6.04 percent for the business income tax
    and 0.98 percent for the modified gross receipts tax.

9: STOCK
    BASED COMPENSATION

We provide a Performance Incentive Stock Plan (the Plan) to key
    employees and non-employee directors based on their
    contributions to the successful management of the company. The
    Plan has a five-year term, expiring in May 2009.

All grants under the Plan for 2007, 2006, and 2005 were in the
    form of total shareholder return (TSR) restricted stock and
    time-lapse restricted stock. Restricted stock recipients receive
    shares of CMS Energy’s Common Stock that have full dividend
    and voting rights. TSR restricted stock vesting is contingent on
    meeting a three-year service requirement and specific market
    conditions. Half of the market condition is based on the
    achievement of specified levels of total shareholder return over
    a three-year period and half is based on a comparison of our
    total shareholder return with the median shareholders’
    return of a peer group over the same three-year period.
    Depending on the performance of the market, a recipient may earn
    a total award ranging from 0 percent to 150 percent of
    the initial grant. Time-lapse restricted stock vests after a
    service period of five years for awards granted prior to 2004,
    and

CE-68

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

three years for awards granted in 2004 and thereafter.
    Restricted stock awards granted to officers in 2006 and 2005
    were entirely TSR restricted stock. Awards granted to officers
    in 2007 were 80 percent TSR restricted stock and
    20 percent time-lapsed restricted stock.

All restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if
    employment terminates before vesting. However, if certain
    minimum service requirements are met or are waived by action of
    the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of
    Directors, restricted shares may vest fully upon retirement or
    disability and vest fully if control of CMS Energy changes, as
    defined by the Plan. The Plan also allows for stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, phantom shares, and performance
    units, none of which were granted in 2007, 2006, or 2005.

Shares awarded or subject to stock options, phantom shares, and
    performance units may not exceed 6 million shares from June
    2004 through May 2009, nor may such awards to any recipient
    exceed 250,000 shares in any fiscal year. We may issue
    awards of up to 3,677,930 shares of common stock under the
    Plan at December 31, 2007. Shares for which payment or
    exercise is in cash, as well as forfeited shares or stock
    options, may be awarded or granted again under the Plan.

    the Plan:

During 2007, we granted 369,150 TSR shares and 83,020 time-lapse
    shares of restricted stock. In addition, we granted
    153,913 shares that immediately vested as a result of
    achieving 150 percent of the market conditions on our 2004
    TSR restricted stock grant. The fair value at the date of grant
    in 2004 was $9.73. We excluded the impact of these shares from
    the weighted-average grant date fair value for the
    2007 shares granted.

We expense the awards’ fair value over the required service
    period. As a result, we recognize all compensation expense for
    share-based awards that have accelerated service provisions upon
    retirement by the period in which the employee becomes eligible
    to retire. We calculate the fair value of time-lapse restricted
    stock based on the price of our common stock on the grant date.
    The fair value of TSR restricted stock awards was calculated on
    the award grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. Expected
    volatilities were based on the historical volatility of the
    price of CMS Energy Common Stock. The risk-free rate for each
    valuation was based on the three-year U.S. Treasury yield
    at the award grant date. The following table summarizes the
    significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the
    TSR restricted stock awards:

The total fair value of shares vested was $10 million in

    Compensation expense related to restricted stock was
    $7 million in 2007, $7 million in 2006, and
    $3 million in 2005. The total related income tax benefit
    recognized in income was $2 million in 2007,
    $2 million in 2006, and $1 million in 2005. At
    December 31, 2007, there was $6 million of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock. We
    expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of
    1.4 years.

    exercise stock options. The total intrinsic value of stock
    options exercised was $6 million in 2007 and

SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to use the fair

    effective for us on January 1, 2006. We elected to adopt
    the modified prospective method recognition provisions of this
    Statement instead of retrospective restatement. We adopted the
    fair value method of accounting for share-based awards effective
    December 2002. Therefore, SFAS No. 123(R) did not have
    a significant impact on our results of operations when it became
    effective.

10: LEASES

We lease various assets, including service vehicles, railcars,
    gas pipeline capacity and buildings. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 13, we account for a number of our power
    purchase agreements as capital and operating leases.

Operating leases for coal-carrying railcars have lease terms
    expiring over the next 15 years. These leases contain fair
    market value extension and buyout provisions, with some
    providing for predetermined extension period rentals. Capital
    leases for our vehicle fleet operations have a maximum term of
    120 months and TRAC end-of-life provisions.

We have capital leases for gas transportation pipelines to the
    Karn generating complex and Zeeland power plant. The capital
    lease for the gas transportation pipeline into the Karn
    generating complex has a term of 15 years with a provision
    to extend the contract from month to month. The capital lease
    for the gas transportation pipeline to the Zeeland power plant
    has a lease term of 12 years with a renewal provision at
    the end of the contract. The remaining term of our long-term
    power purchase agreements range between 5 and 22 years.
    Most of our power purchase agreements contain provisions at the
    end of the initial contract term to renew the agreement annually.

(a)

In April 2007, we sold Palisades to Entergy and entered into a

15-year

power purchase agreement to buy all of the capacity and energy
    produced by Palisades, up to the annual average capacity of
    798 MW. We provided $30 million in security to Entergy
    for our power purchase agreement obligation in the form of a
    letter of credit. We estimate that capacity and energy payments
    under the Palisades power purchase agreement will average
    $300 million annually. Our total purchases of capacity and
    energy under the Palisades power purchase agreement were
    $180 million in 2007.

Because of the Palisades power purchase agreement and our
    continuing involvement with the Palisades assets, we accounted
    for the disposal of Palisades as a financing and not a sale.
    SFAS No. 98 specifies the accounting required for a
    seller’s sale and simultaneous leaseback involving real
    estate. We have continuing involvement with Palisades through
    security provided to Entergy for our power purchase agreement
    obligation and our DOE liability and other forms of involvement.
    As a result, we accounted for the Palisades plant, which is the
    real estate asset subject to the leaseback, as a financing for
    accounting purposes and not a sale. As a financing, no gain on
    the sale of Palisades was recognized in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income (Loss). We accounted for the remaining
    non-real estate assets and liabilities associated with the
    transaction as a sale.

As a financing, the Palisades plant remains on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets and we continue to depreciate it. We recorded the
    related proceeds as a finance obligation with payments recorded
    to interest expense and the finance obligation based on the
    amortization of the obligation over the life of the Palisades
    power purchase agreement. The value of the finance obligation
    was based on an allocation of the transaction proceeds to the
    fair values of the net assets sold and fair value of the
    Palisades plant asset under the financing. Total charges under
    the financing were $10 million in 2007.

    Amortization of intangible assets is forecasted to range between
    $12 million and $22 million per year over the next
    five years.

Asset Acquisition:

In December 2007, we purchased a
    935 MW gas-fired power plant located in Zeeland, Michigan
    for $519 million from an affiliate of LS Power Group. The
    original cost of the plant was $350 million and the plant
    acquisition adjustment was $213 million. This results in an
    increase to property, plant, and equipment of $519 million,
    net of $44 million of accumulated depreciation. The
    purchase also increased capital leases by $12 million. For
    additional details on the Zeeland finance lease, see
    Note 10, Leases.

Net investment is the amount of utility plant in service less

We include our share of the direct expenses of the jointly owned
    plants in operating expenses. We share operation, maintenance,
    and other expenses of these jointly owned utility facilities in
    proportion to each participant’s undivided ownership
    interest. We are required to provide only our share of financing
    for the jointly owned utility facilities.

13: REPORTABLE
    SEGMENTS

Our reportable segments consist of business units defined by the
    products and services they offer. We evaluate performance based
    on the net income of each segment. Our two reportable segments
    are electric utility and gas utility.

The electric utility segment consists of regulated activities
    associated with the generation and distribution of electricity
    in Michigan. The gas utility segment consists of regulated
    activities associated with the transportation, storage, and
    distribution of natural gas in Michigan.

CE-73

CONSUMERS ENERGY
    COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Accounting policies of our segments are as described in the
    summary of significant accounting policies. Our consolidated
    financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues,
    and expenses of the two individual segments when appropriate. We
    allocate accounts between the electric and gas segments where
    common accounts are attributable to both segments. The
    allocations are based on certain measures of business
    activities, such as revenue, labor dollars, customers,
    construction expense, leased property, taxes or functional
    surveys. For example, customer receivables are allocated based
    on revenue, and pension provisions are allocated based on labor
    dollars.

We account for inter-segment sales and transfers at current
    market prices and eliminate them in consolidated net income
    (loss) available to common stockholder by segment. The
    “Other” segment includes our consolidated special
    purpose entity for the sale of trade receivables, and in 2005
    and 2006 the MCV Partnership and the FMLP.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and
    the related consolidated statements of income (loss), of cash
    flows, and of common stockholder’s equity present fairly,
    in all material respects, the financial position of Consumers
    Energy Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007,
    and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
    listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements and on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our integrated audit. We
    conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain income tax provisions in 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholder of Consumers Energy
    Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Consumers Energy Company (a Michigan Corporation and
    wholly-owned subsidiary of CMS Energy Corporation) as of
    December 31, 2006, and the related consolidated statements
    of income (loss), common stockholder’s equity, and cash
    flows for each of the two years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule as it relates to 2006 and 2005 listed in the
    Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We did
    not audit the financial statements of Midland Cogeneration
    Venture Limited Partnership, a former 49% owned variable
    interest entity which has been consolidated through the date of
    sale, November 21, 2006 (Note 2), which statements
    reflect total revenues constituting 9.5% in 2006 and 11.3% in
    2005 of the related consolidated totals. Those statements were
    audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us,
    and our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,
    insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the periods
    indicated above for Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited
    Partnership is based solely on the report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the
    report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other
    auditors, the financial statements referred to above present
    fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
    position of Consumers Energy Company at December 31, 2006,
    and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
    flows for each of the two years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
    statements, in 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132(R).” As discussed in Note 9 to the
    consolidated financial statements, in 2006, the Company adopted

    “Share-Based Payment.”

    ENERGY’S CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
    and Procedures:

Under the supervision and with the
    participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMS
    Energy conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and
    procedures (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, CMS
    Energy’s CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
    2007.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting:

CMS Energy’s management is responsible
    for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

CMS Energy’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America and includes policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of CMS Energy;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of
    CMS Energy are being made only in accordance with authorizations
    of management and directors of CMS Energy; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of CMS
    Energy’s assets that could have a material effect on its
    financial statements.

Management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its
    internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all
    fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
    design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
    resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
    considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation
    of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those
    internal controls may become inadequate in future periods
    because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including its CEO and CFO, CMS Energy conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this
    evaluation, management used the criteria set forth in the
    framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, CMS Energy’s
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

There have been no changes in CMS Energy’s internal control
    over financial reporting during the most recently completed
    fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
    likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial
    reporting.

Consumers’ management is responsible for

Rule 13a-15(f).

Consumers’ internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of
    Consumers are being made only in accordance with authorizations
    of management and directors of Consumers; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
    Consumers’ assets that could have a material effect on its
    financial statements.

Management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its
    internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all
    fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the

    because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including its CEO and CFO, Consumers conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this
    evaluation, management used the criteria set forth in the
    framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, Consumers’
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting:

There have been no changes in
    Consumers’ internal control over financial reporting during
    the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its
    internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 11.
    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Information that is required in Item 11 regarding executive
    compensation of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ executive
    officers is included in CMS Energy’s definitive proxy
    statement, which is incorporated by reference herein.

OFFICER INCENTIVE
    COMPENSATION PLAN

On February 19, 2008, the Compensation and Human Resources
    Committees of the Boards of Directors of CMS Energy and
    Consumers (the “C&HR Committees”) approved the
    payout of cash bonuses for 2007 under the Annual Officer
    Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”).

The C&HR Committees approved achievement of the composite
    plan performance factor resulting in payout under the Plan at
    148 percent. In doing so the C&HR Committees decided
    to exclude the $519 million Zeeland plant

CO-3

purchase, which was not included in the 2007 budget but was
    completed in December 2007, from what constitutes corporate free
    cash flow. Completing the purchase in 2007 provided significant
    benefits including certain tax benefits to Consumers that would
    otherwise not have been available had the transaction been
    completed in 2008.

On January 24, 2008, the C&HR Committees approved the
    material terms of the Plan, including the 2008 corporate
    performance goals thereunder. The Plan includes the material
    terms detailed below, although the specific target levels for
    the corporate performance goals vary from year to year.

Corporate Performance:

The composite plan performance
    factor depends on corporate performance in two areas as
    described in the Plan: (1) the adjusted net income per
    outstanding CMS Energy common share (“Plan EPS”); and
    (2) the corporate free cash flow of CMS Energy
    (“CFCF”). Plan EPS performance constitutes one-half of
    the composite plan performance factor and CFCF performance
    constitutes one-half of the composite plan performance factor.
    There will be a payout under the Plan if either Plan EPS
    performance is not less than 10 cents below target EPS or CFCF
    is not less than $100 million below target CFCF. Even if
    only one but not both of these target minimums is achieved, a
    partial payout would result. The composite plan performance
    factor to be used for payouts is capped at a maximum of
    200 percent. Annual awards under the Plan to
    Consumers’ officers may be reduced by 25 percent in
    the event that there is no payout to non-officer, non-union
    employees under a separate Consumers’ employee incentive
    plan.

Annual Award Formula:

Annual awards for each eligible
    officer will be based upon a standard award percentage of the
    officer’s base salary as in effect on January 1 of the
    performance year. The maximum amount that can be awarded under
    the Plan for any Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m)
    employee will not exceed $2.5 million in any one
    performance year. Annual awards for officers will be calculated
    and made as follows: Individual Award = Base Salary times
    Standard Award% times Performance Factor%.

The standard award percentages for officers are based on
    individual salary grade levels and remain unchanged from the
    2007 plan except for two eligible officers. The standard award
    percentage target for the Chief Executive Officer was increased
    to 100 percent from 65 percent and the Chief Operating
    Officer’s standard award percentage target was increased to
    60 percent from 55 percent as described in the

Form 8-K

filed December 4, 2007.

Payment of Annual Awards:

All annual awards for a
    performance year will be paid in cash no later than
    March 15th of the calendar year following the
    performance year provided that they first have been reviewed and
    approved by the C&HR Committees, and provided further that
    the annual award for a particular performance year has not been
    deferred voluntarily. The amounts required by law to be withheld
    for income and employment taxes will be deducted from the annual
    award payments. All annual awards become the obligation of the
    company on whose payroll the employee is enrolled at the time
    the C&HR Committees make the annual award.
