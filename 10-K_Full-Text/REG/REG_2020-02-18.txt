EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 of Regency Centers Corporation and Regency Centers, L.P.  Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Regency Centers Corporation” or the “Parent Company” mean Regency Centers Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries and references to “Regency Centers, L.P.” or the “Operating Partnership” mean Regency Centers, L.P. and its controlled subsidiaries.  The term “the Company”, “Regency Centers” or “Regency” means the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, collectively.

The Parent Company is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and the general partner of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units (“Units”).  As of December 31, 2019, the Parent Company owned approximately 99.6% of the Units in the Operating Partnership.  The remaining limited Units are owned by investors.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.

The Company believes combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:

•

Enhances investors' understanding of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;

•

Eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation; and

•

Creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

Management operates the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership as one business.  The management of the Parent Company consists of the same individuals as the management of the Operating Partnership.  These individuals are officers of the Parent Company and employees of the Operating Partnership.

The Company believes it is important to understand the key differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company.  The Parent Company is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.  As a result, the Parent Company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership.  Except for $500 million of unsecured public and private placement debt, the Parent Company does not hold any indebtedness, but guarantees all of the unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership is also the co-issuer and guarantees the $500 million of Parent Company debt.  The Operating Partnership holds all the assets of the Company and retains the ownership interests in the Company's joint ventures.  Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by the Parent Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company's business.  These sources include the Operating Partnership's operations, its direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of partnership units.

Stockholders' equity, partners' capital, and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and those of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units.  The limited partners' units in the Operating Partnership owned by third parties are accounted for in partners' capital in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and outside of stockholders' equity in noncontrolling interests in the Parent Company's financial statements.

In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, there are sections in this report that separately discuss the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, including separate financial statements, controls and procedures sections, and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications.  In the sections that combine disclosure for the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company.

As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership.  Therefore, while stockholders' equity and partners' capital differ as discussed above, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.

PART I

Item 1. Business

Regency Centers Corporation is a fully integrated real estate company and self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust that began its operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993.  Regency Centers L.P. is the entity through which Regency Centers Corporation conducts substantially all of its operations and owns substantially all of its assets.

Our business consists of acquiring, developing, owning and operating income-producing retail real estate principally located in many of the top markets in the United States.  We generate revenues by leasing space to retail tenants such as highly productive grocers, restaurants, service providers, and best-in-class retailers.

Following our merger with Equity One Inc. (“Equity One”) in 2017, Regency became an S&P 500 Index member.

As of December 31, 2019, we had full or partial ownership interests in 419 properties, primarily anchored by market leading grocery stores, encompassing 52.6 million square feet (“SF”) of gross leasable area (“GLA”). Our Pro-rata share of this GLA is 42.8 million square feet, including our share of the partially owned properties.

Our mission is to be the preeminent national owner, operator, and developer of shopping centers, creating places that provide a thriving environment for outstanding retailers and service providers to connect with the surrounding neighborhoods and communities.  Our goals are to:

•

Own and manage a portfolio of high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers anchored by market leading grocers and located in affluent suburban and near urban trade areas in the country’s most desirable metro areas.  We expect that this combination will produce highly desirable and attractive centers with best-in-class retailers.  These centers should command higher rental and occupancy rates resulting in excellent prospects to grow net operating income (“NOI”);

•

Maintain an industry leading and disciplined development and redevelopment platform to deliver exceptional retail centers at higher returns as compared to acquisitions;

•

Support our business activities with a conservative capital structure, including a strong balance sheet;

•

Attain best-in-class environmental, social, and governance practices;

•

Engage an exceptional and diverse team that is guided by our strong values and special culture, while fostering an environment of innovation and continuous improvement that will deploy industry-leading operating standards; and

•

Increase earnings per share and dividends and generate total returns at or near the top of our shopping center peers.

Key strategies to achieve our goals are to:

•

Sustain same property NOI growth that over the long-term consistently ranks at or near the top of our shopping center peers;

•

Develop and redevelop high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment;

•

Maintain a conservative balance sheet providing financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities on a favorable basis, and to weather economic downturns;


•

Maintain the highest standards for corporate governance and act as good stewards of our communities and the environment;

and

•

Attract and motivate an exceptional team of employees who operate efficiently and are recognized as industry leaders.

Corporate Responsibility

Our vision is to be the preeminent national owner, operator and developer of shopping centers, connecting outstanding retailers and service providers with their neighborhoods and communities while practicing best-in-class corporate responsibility.  We have established four pillars for our corporate responsibility program that we believe support our vision and mission:

•

Our People;

•

Our Communities;

•

Ethics and Governance; and

•

Environmental Stewardship.

Our people are our greatest asset and we work to support our highly engaged team that drives our business and is critical to achieving our strategic objectives. We maintain a safe and pleasant workspace, promote employee well-being, and empower our employees by focusing on health and benefits, training and education, safety, and diversity.

Our team is also passionate about investing in and connecting with the communities in which we live and work. Philanthropy and giving back are cornerstones of what we do and who we are. Our local teams personally customize and cultivate our centers by bringing tenants and shoppers together and continually engage with the communities in which we operate.

As stewards of our investors’ capital, we are committed to best-in-class corporate governance practice. We place great emphasis on integrity and transparency, which extends to our reporting practices, long-term value creation for our stakeholders, and strong culture of business compliance.

We believe sustainability is in the best interest of our tenants, investors, employees, and the communities in which we operate. We have five strategic priorities when it comes to identifying and implementing sustainable business practices and minimizing our environmental impact: green building, energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, water conservation, and waste minimization and management. We believe these commitments are not only the right thing to do to address material environmental topics such as air pollution, climate change, and resource scarcity, but also support us in achieving key strategic objectives in operations and development.

We are committed to transparency with regard to our corporate responsibility and sustainability performance, risks and opportunities, and will continue to enhance disclosures using industry accepted reporting frameworks.  More information about our corporate responsibility strategy, goals, performance, and formal disclosures are available on our website at www.regencycenters.com.  The content of our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.

Competition

We are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues, number of properties, GLA, and market capitalization.  There are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets, including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers.  This results in competition for attracting tenants, as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites.  We believe that our competitive advantages are driven by:

•

our locations within our market areas;

•

the design and high quality of our shopping centers;

•

the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers;

•

our relationships with our anchor tenants and our side-shop and out-parcel retailers;

•

our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers; and

•

our ability to source and develop new shopping centers.


Employees

Our corporate headquarters are located at One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida.  We presently maintain 22 market offices nationwide, including our corporate headquarters, where we conduct management, leasing, construction, and investment activities.  We have 450 employees throughout the United States and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Compliance with Governmental Regulations

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be liable for the cost to remove certain hazardous substances at our shopping centers that generally arise from dry cleaners, gas stations, and historic land use practices.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous substances.  The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly address such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral.  Although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of clean up, known environmental corrective actions are not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to our environmental insurance programs, various state-regulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state, and existing accrued liabilities.

Executive Officers

Our executive officers are appointed each year by our Board of Directors.  Each of our executive officers has been employed by us for more than five years and, as of December 31, 2019, included the following:

(3)

Mr. Mas assumed the responsibilities of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective August 2019.  Prior to this appointment, Mr. Mas served as Managing Director, Finance, since February 2017, and Senior Vice President, Capital Markets, since 2013.

Defined Terms

In addition to the required Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) presentations, we use certain non-GAAP performance measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operational results.  We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.

The following terms, as defined, are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results:

•

Development Completion

is a property in development that is deemed complete upon the earliest of: (i) 90% of total estimated net development costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95%, or (ii) the property features at least two years of anchor operations, or (iii) three years have passed since the start of construction. Once deemed complete, the property is termed a Retail Operating Property the following calendar year.

•

Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

is defined as Operating EBITDA

re

divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders.

•

NAREIT EBITDAre

is a measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) gains on sales of real estate, (v) impairments of real estate, and (vi) adjustments to reflect the Company's share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  We provide a reconciliation of Net Income to NAREIT EBITDA

re

.

•

NAREIT Funds from Operations (“NAREIT FFO”)

is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which NAREIT defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sales and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  We compute NAREIT FFO for all periods presented in accordance with NAREIT's definition in effect during that period.  Effective January 1, 2019, we prospectively adopted the NAREIT FFO White Paper – 2018 Restatement (“2018 FFO White Paper”), and elected the option of excluding gains on sale and impairments of land, which are considered incidental to our main business.  Prior period amounts were not restated to conform to the current year presentation, and therefore are calculated as described above, and also include gains on sale and impairments of land.

Companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions.  Since NAREIT FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sales and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs.  This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP.  Thus, NAREIT FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations.  We provide a reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders to NAREIT FFO.

•

Net Operating Income (“NOI”)

is the sum of base rent, percentage rent, recoveries from tenants, other lease income, and other property income, less operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, ground rent, and uncollectible lease income / provision for doubtful accounts.  NOI excludes straight-line rental income and expense, above and below market


rent and ground rent amortization, tenant lease inducement amortization, and other fees.

We

also provide disclosure of NOI excluding termination fees, which excludes both termination fee income and expenses.

•

Non-Same Property

is any property, during either calendar year period being compared, that was acquired, sold, a Property in Development, a Development Completion, or a property under, or being positioned for, significant redevelopment that distorts comparability between periods.  Non-retail properties and corporate activities, including the captive insurance program, are part of Non-Same Property.

•

Operating EBITDAre

begins with the NAREIT EBITDA

re

and excludes certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization and straight-line rents. We provide a reconciliation of Net Income to NAREIT EBITDA

re

to Operating EBITDA

re.

•

Pro-rata

information includes 100% of our consolidated properties plus our economic share (based on our ownership interest) in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships.

We provide Pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships, when read in conjunction with the Company’s reported results under GAAP.  We believe presenting our Pro-rata share of assets, liabilities, operating results, and certain operating metrics, along with other non-GAAP measures, makes comparisons of other REITs' operating results to ours more meaningful.  The Pro-rata information provided is not, nor is it intended to be, presented in accordance with GAAP.  The Pro-rata supplemental details of assets and liabilities and supplemental details of operations reflect our proportionate economic ownership of the assets, liabilities and operating results of the properties in our portfolio

The Pro-rata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the assets, liabilities, and operating results of properties in our portfolio.  We do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships, and the Pro-rata presentations of the assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items.  The partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements, which generally provide for such allocations according to their invested capital.  Our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our Pro-rata share.

The presentation of Pro-rata information has limitations which include, but are not limited to, the following:

o

The amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting or allocating noncontrolling interests, and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses; and

o

Other companies in our industry may calculate their Pro-rata interest differently, limiting the comparability of Pro-rata information.

Because of these limitations, the Pro-rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP.  We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements, using the Pro-rata information as a supplement.

•

Property In Development

includes properties in various stages of ground-up development.

•

Property In Redevelopment

includes Retail Operating Properties under redevelopment or being positioned for redevelopment.  Unless otherwise indicated, a Property in Redevelopment is included in the Same Property pool.

•

Retail Operating Property

is any retail property not termed a Property in Development.  A retail property is any property where the majority of the income is generated from retail uses.

•

Same Property

is a Retail Operating Property that was owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar year periods being compared.  This term excludes Properties in Development, prior year Development Completions, and Non-Same Properties.  Properties in Redevelopment are included unless otherwise indicated.


Item 1A. Risk Factors

Risk Factors Related to the Retail Industry

Economic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow, and increase our operating expenses.

Our properties are leased primarily to retail tenants from whom we derive most of our revenue in the form of base rent, expense recoveries and other income.  Therefore, our performance and operating results are directly linked to the economic and market conditions occurring in the retail industry.  We are subject to the risks that, upon expiration, leases for space in our properties are not renewed by existing tenants, vacant space is not leased to new tenants, or tenants demand new lease terms, including costs for renovations or concessions.  The market for leasing retail space in our properties may be adversely affected by any of the following:

•

changes in national, regional and local economic conditions;

•

changes in population and migration patterns to/from the markets in which we operate;

•

deterioration in the competitiveness and creditworthiness of our retail tenants;

•

increased competition from the use of e-commerce by retailers and consumers as well as other concepts such as super-stores and warehouse clubs;

•

tenant bankruptcies and subsequent rejections of our leases;

•

reductions in consumer spending and retail sales;

•

reduced tenant demand for retail space;

•

oversupply of retail space;

•

reduced consumer demand for certain retail categories;

•

consolidation within the retail sector;

•

increased operating costs;

•

perceptions by retailers and shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our properties; and

•

acts of terrorism and war, natural disasters and other physical and weather-related damages to our properties.

To the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact the retail industry, our retail tenants, the demand and market rents for retail space, the occupancy levels of our properties, our ability to sell, acquire or develop properties, our operating results and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders.

Shifts in retail sales and delivery methods between brick and mortar stores, e-commerce, home delivery, and curbside pick-up may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.

Retailers are increasingly impacted by e-commerce and changes in customer buying habits, including the delivery or curbside pick-up of items ordered online.  Retailers are considering these e-commerce trends when making decisions regarding their bricks and mortar stores and how they will compete and innovate in a rapidly changing retail environment.  Many retailers in our shopping centers provide services or sell goods, which have historically been less likely to be purchased online; however, the continuing increase in e-commerce sales in all retail categories may cause retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future or close stores.  Our grocer tenants are incorporating e-commerce concepts through home delivery and curbside pick-up, which could reduce foot traffic at our centers.  In certain higher-income markets, foot traffic at our centers may be impacted more by these alternative delivery methods if consumers are willing to pay premiums for such services.  This shift may adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates, which would impact our revenues and cash flows.  Changes in shopping trends as a result of the growth in e-commerce may also impact the profitability of retailers that do not adapt to changes in market conditions.  These conditions may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to meet the needs of our tenants or if our tenants encounter financial difficulties as a result of changing market conditions.


Changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow.

Economic conditions in markets where our properties are concentrated can greatly influence our financial performance.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, our properties in California, Florida, Texas, New York and Virginia accounted for 29.0%, 21.0%, 6.9%, 5.7%, and 5.0% respectively, of our NOI from Consolidated Properties plus our Pro-rata share from Unconsolidated Properties (“Pro-rata basis”).  Our revenues and cash flow may be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions, such as supply of or demand for retail space, deteriorate more significantly in these states compared to other geographic areas.

Our success depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants.

“Anchor Tenants” (tenants occupying 10,000 square feet or more) occupy large stores in our shopping centers, pay a significant portion of the total rent at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by attracting shoppers to the property.  We derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as Publix, Kroger Co., Albertsons Companies, Inc., TJX Companies, Inc., and Whole Foods who accounted for 3.2%, 3.0%, 2.8%, 2.4%, and 2.4%, respectively, of our total annualized base rent on a Pro-rata basis, for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Additionally, other tenants with significant lease obligations at a singular location could also have a material impact on our earnings if they are unable to fulfill their lease obligations or fail to renew their leases.  Our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by the loss of revenues and additional costs in the event a significant anchor tenant:

•

becomes bankrupt or insolvent;

•

experiences a downturn in its business;

•

materially defaults on its leases;

•

does not renew its leases as they expire;

•

renews at lower rental rates and/or requires a tenant improvement allowance; or

•

renews but reduces its store size, which results in down-time and additional tenant improvement costs to the landlord to re-lease the vacated space.

Some anchors have the right to vacate their space and may prevent us from re-tenanting by continuing to comply and pay rent in accordance with their lease agreement.  Vacated anchor space, including space owned by the anchor, can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center in other spaces because of the loss of the departed anchor's customer drawing power.  If a significant tenant vacates a property, co-tenancy clauses in select lease contracts may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations.  Co-tenancy clauses have several variants: they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores; they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration; or more commonly, they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center.

Additionally, many of our shopping centers are anchored by retailers who own their space whose location is within or immediately adjacent to our shopping center (“shadow anchors”).  In those cases, the shadow anchors appear to the consumer as a retail tenant of the shopping center and, as a result, attract additional consumer traffic to the center.  In the event that a shadow anchor were to close, it could negatively impact our center as consumer traffic would likely be reduced.

A significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller “shop space” tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful.

“Shop Space Tenants” (tenants occupying less than 10,000 square feet) may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than Anchor Tenants.  Shop Space Tenants may be facing reduced sales as a result of an increase in competition including from e-commerce retailers.  The types of Shop Space Tenants vary from retail shops and restaurants to service providers.  If we are unable to attract the right type or mix of Shop Space Tenants into our centers, our revenues and cash flow may be adversely impacted.

At December 31, 2019, Shop Space Tenants represent approximately 36.0% of our GLA leased at average base rents of $34.86 per square foot (“PSF”).  A one-percent decline in our shop space occupancy may result in a reduction to base rent of approximately $5.0 million.

We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy.

Although lease income (including base rent and recoveries from tenants) are supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file for bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores.  Any unsecured claim we hold against a


bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims.

As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold.

Additionally, we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to re-lease the vacated space. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files

for

bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we may experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by the bankrupt tenant.

Risk Factors Related to Real Estate Investments and Operations

We are subject to numerous laws and regulations that may adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability.

Our properties are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations, some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to varying judicial or regulatory interpretations.  These laws and regulations may include zoning laws, building codes, competition laws, rules and agreements, landlord-tenant laws, property tax regulations or changes in real estate assessments, including changes in laws related thereto, and other laws and regulations generally applicable to business operations.  Noncompliance with such laws and regulations, and any associated litigation may expose us to liability.

Our real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income.

Our real estate properties are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  We evaluate whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, such that the value of the real estate properties (including any related tangible or intangible assets or liabilities, including goodwill) may not be recoverable.  Through the evaluation, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated holding periods, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and may differ materially from actual results.  Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss may be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.  To the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.

The fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through the use of comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach.  Such cash flow projections take into account expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other relevant criteria, and therefore are subject to management judgment.  Changes in these factors may impact the determination of fair value. In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.

These subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income, which may be material.  There can be no assurance that we will not record impairment charges in the future related to our assets.

We face risks associated with development, redevelopment and expansion of properties.

We actively pursue opportunities for new retail development, or existing property redevelopment or expansion.  Development and redevelopment activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay this process.  We may not recover our investment in development or redevelopment projects for which approvals are not received. We are subject to other risks associated with these activities, including the following risks:

•

we may be unable to lease developments or redevelopments to full occupancy on a timely basis;

•

the occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable;

•

actual costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project unprofitable;

•

delays in the development or construction process may increase our costs;

•

construction cost increases may reduce investment returns on development and redevelopment opportunities;

•

we may abandon development or redevelopment opportunities and lose our investment due to adverse market conditions;


•

the size of our development

and redevelopment

pipeline may strain our labor or capital capacity to complete

the

development

and redevelopment project

s within targeted timelines and may reduce our investment returns;

•

a reduction in the demand for new retail space may reduce our future development and redevelopment activities, which in turn may reduce our net operating income; and

•

changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity may adversely impact our results from operations by reducing the amount of internal overhead costs that may be capitalized.

We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties.

We are expanding our investment focus to include more complex acquisitions and mixed-use development and redevelopment projects in very dense urban locations, which pose unique risks to our return on investment.  Mixed-use projects refer to real estate projects that, in addition to retail space, may also include space for residential, office, hotel or other commercial purposes.  We have less experience in developing and managing non-retail real estate than we do retail real estate.  As a result, if a development or redevelopment project includes a non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer, or partner with a developer.

•

If we decide to develop the non-retail components ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate, but also to risks associated with developing, owning, operating or selling non-retail real estate, including but not limited to more complex entitlement processes and multiple-story buildings. These unique risks may adversely impact our return on investment in these mixed-use development projects.

•

If we sell the non-retail components, our retail component will be impacted by the decisions made by the other owners, and actions of those occupying the non-retail spaces in these mixed-use properties.

•

If we partner with a developer, it makes us dependent upon the partner's ability to perform and to agree on major decisions that impact our investment returns of the project.  In addition, there is a risk that the non-retail developer may default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other components ourselves, including providing necessary financing.

In addition, redevelopment of existing shopping centers into mixed-use projects generally includes tenant vacancies before and during the redevelopment, which could result in volatility in NOI.

We face risks associated with the acquisition of properties.

Our investment strategy includes investing in high-quality shopping centers that are leased to market-dominant grocers, category-leading anchors, specialty retailers, or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities.  The acquisition of properties and/or real estate entities entails risks that include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows:

•

properties we acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we estimate, which may result in the properties' failure to achieve the investment returns we project;

•

our investigation of an entity, property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representation we may have received from such seller, may fail to reveal various liabilities including defects, necessary repairs or environmental matters requiring corrective action, which may increase our costs;

•

our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short, either of which may result in the property failing to achieve our projected return, either temporarily or permanently;

•

we may not recover our costs from an unsuccessful acquisition;

•

our acquisition activities may distract or strain our management capacity; and

•

we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquisition into our existing operations platform.

We face risks if we expand into new markets.

If opportunities arise, we may acquire or develop properties in markets where we currently have no presence.  Each of the risks applicable to acquiring or developing properties in our current markets are applicable to acquiring, developing and integrating properties in new markets.  In addition, we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and conditions of the new markets we may enter, which may adversely affect our operating results and investment returns in those markets.


We may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions.

Our properties, including their related tangible and intangible assets, represent the majority of our total consolidated assets and they may not be readily convertible to cash.  As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties, including properties held in joint ventures, in response to changes in economic, industry, or other conditions may be limited.  The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability and terms of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand for space, that are beyond our control.  There may be less demand for lower quality properties that we have identified for ultimate disposition in markets with uncertain economic or retail environments, and where buyers are more reliant on the availability of third party mortgage financing.  If we want to sell a property, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment.  Moreover, if a property is mortgaged, we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of a substantial prepayment penalty, which may restrict our ability to dispose of the property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable.

Certain properties we own have a low tax basis, which may result in a taxable gain on sale.  We intend to utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income; however, there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions.  In the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges, we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax, which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments.

Certain of the properties in our portfolio are subject to ground leases; if we are unable to renew a ground lease, purchase the fee simple interest, or are found to be in breach of a ground lease, we may be adversely affected.

We have 28 properties in our portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties.  Accordingly, we only own a long-term leasehold or similar interest in those properties.  If we are unable to purchase a fee interest in the underlying land or extend the terms of these leases before or upon their expiration, as to which no assurance can be given, we will lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate such properties.  In addition, if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease, we may lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate the property that is subject to the ground lease.  The existing lease terms, including renewal options, were taken into consideration when making our investment decisions.  The purchase price and subsequent improvements are being depreciated over the shorter of the remaining life of the ground leases or the useful life of the underlying assets.  If we were to lose the right to operate a property due to not exercising renewal options of the ground lease or a breach, we would be unable to derive income from such property, which would impair the value of our investments, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Climate change may adversely impact our properties directly and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees.

To the extent climate change causes adverse changes in weather patterns, our properties in certain markets may experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea‑levels.  Climate change may result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate certain properties at all.  Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance, or making insurance unavailable.  Moreover, compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or pay additional taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties.  Although we strive to identify, analyze, and respond to the risk and opportunities that climate change presents, at this time, there can be no assurance that climate change will not have an adverse effect on us.

Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change.

A significant number of our properties are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, sea-level rise, and other natural disasters.  At December 31, 2019, 28% of the total insured value of our portfolio is located in the state of California, including a number of properties in the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles areas.  Additionally, 18% and 7% of the total insured value of our portfolio is located in the states of Florida and Texas, respectively.  Recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to increase significantly in the future.  We recognize that the frequency and / or intensity of extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other climatic changes may continue to increase, and as a result, our exposure to these events may increase.  These weather conditions may disrupt our business and the business of our tenants, which may affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of tenants or residents to remain in or move to these affected areas.  Therefore, as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, we face risks, including disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants and higher costs, such as uninsured property losses, higher insurance premiums, and potential additional regulatory requirements by government agencies in response to perceived risks.

An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties.

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, terrorism, business interruption, and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties.  Some types of losses, such as losses from named windstorms, earthquakes, terrorism, or wars may have limited coverage or be excluded from insurance coverage.  Although we carry


specific insurance coverage for named windstorm and earthquake losses, the policies are subject to deductibles up to 2% to 5% of the total insured value of each property, up to a $10 million maximum deductible per occurrence for each of these perils, with limits of $300 million per occurrence for all perils except earthquake, which has a total annual aggregate limit of $300 million.

Terrorism coverage is limited to $200 million per occurrence related to property damage.

Liability claims are limited to $151 million per occurrence.

Should a loss occur at any of our properties that is subject to a substantial deductible or is in excess of the property or casualty insurance limits of our policies, we may lose part or all of our invested capital and revenues from such property, which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.

Terrorist activities or violence occurring at our properties also may directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss.  Insurance for such acts may be unavailable or cost more resulting in an increase to our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.  To the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks, their businesses may be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases.

Loss of our key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations.

The success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees may significantly impact our future performance.  Competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot be assured that we will retain all of our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future.  Losing any one or more of these persons may have an adverse effect on us.

We face competition from numerous sources, including other REITs and other real estate owners.

The ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented.  We face competition from other public REITs, large private investors, institutional investors, and from numerous small owners in the acquisition, ownership, and leasing of shopping centers.  We also compete to develop shopping centers with other REITs engaged in development activities as well as with local, regional, and national real estate developers.  This competition may:

•

reduce the number of properties available for acquisition or development;

•

increase the cost of properties available for acquisition or development; and

•

hinder our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates and/or reduced rents.

If we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets, our cash flow, and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders, may be adversely affected.

Costs of environmental remediation may reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders.

Under various federal, state, and local laws, an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or addressing the presence of hazardous substances on the property, generally arising from dry cleaners, gas stations, and historic land use practices.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances.  The presence of, or the failure to properly address the presence of, hazardous substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral.  We can provide no assurance that we are aware of all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that our properties will not be affected by tenants or nearby properties or other unrelated third parties; and that future uses or conditions, or changes in environmental laws and regulations will not result in additional material environmental liabilities to us.

Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unexpected expenditures.

All of our properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities.  Compliance with ADA requirements may require removal of access barriers, and noncompliance may result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both.  While the tenants to whom we lease space in our properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these tenants to cover costs may be adversely affected.  In addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties.  We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements, and these expenditures may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders.


The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal, financial or other data or of Regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.

Many of our information technology systems (including those we use for administration, accounting, and communications, as well as the systems of our co-investment partners and other third-party business partners and service providers, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers) contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our tenants and employees.  Many of our information technology systems also contain our proprietary information and other confidential information related to our business.  We are frequently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems.  To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of tenants’ or employees' data or our confidential information stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, such a breach may damage our reputation and cause us to lose tenants and revenues, incur third party claims and cause disruption to our business and plans.  Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability, and we may not be able to recover these expenses from our service providers, responsible parties, or insurance carriers.

Additionally, federal, state and local authorities continue to develop laws to address data privacy protection.  Monitoring such changes, and taking steps to comply, involves significant costs and effort by management, which may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.

The techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time.  We manage cyber risk by evaluating the impact of a potential cyber breach on our business and determining the level of investment in the prevention, detection and response to a breach.  We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.

Despite the implementation of security measures for our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, our systems are vulnerable to damages from multiple sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failure.  Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business and cause us to incur additional costs to remedy such damages.

Risk Factors Related to Our Partnerships and Joint Ventures

We do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our co-investment partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued.

We have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of partnerships and joint ventures to acquire, own, lease, develop or redevelop properties.  These activities are subject to the same risks as our investments in our wholly-owned properties.  These investments, and other future similar investments may involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt, suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness, or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions.  Partners or other owners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.

These investments, and other future similar investments, also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as a sale or financing, because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture.  Disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and efforts on our business.  Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners.  These factors may limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates.

The termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.

If partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason, we could lose the asset, property management, leasing and construction management fees from these partnerships as well as the operating income of the properties, which may adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders.  Certain of our partnership operating agreements provide either member the ability to elect buy/sell clauses.  The election of these dissolution provisions could require us to invest additional capital to acquire the partners’ interest or to sell our share of the property thereby losing the operating income and cash flow.


Risk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital Structure

Our ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower NOI at our properties which may dilute earnings.

As part of our funding strategy, we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile.  These sales proceeds are used to fund debt repayment, acquisition of operating properties, and the construction of new developments and redevelopments.  An increase in market capitalization rates or a decline in NOI may cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale, which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated.  Additionally, the sale of properties resulting in significant tax gains may require higher distributions to our stockholders or payment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our REIT status.

We may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax-deferred contribution transactions, which may result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets.

We may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in our operating partnership, which may result in stockholder dilution.  This acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we may deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases.  These restrictions may limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.

We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.

To qualify as a REIT, the Parent Company must, among other things, distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (excluding any net capital gains).  Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations.  In such instances, we would rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings.  Our access to debt depends on our credit rating, the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets.  In addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us, we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our partnerships and joint ventures are eligible to refinance.

In addition, our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing.  Additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders' interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage.

Without access to external sources of capital, we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales.  Our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate.  If we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales, we may be forced to reduce the amount of, or eliminate altogether, our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business.

Our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we do not expect to generate sufficient operating cash flow to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due.  If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced (i) to dispose of properties, which might result in losses, or (ii) to obtain financing at unfavorable terms, either of which may reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders.  If we cannot make required mortgage payments, the mortgagee may foreclose on the property securing the mortgage.

Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition.

Our unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants, including compliance with financial ratios, such as ratio of indebtedness to total asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio.  These covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our investment activities.  Moreover, if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements, and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period, our lenders may require us to repay the debt immediately, even in the absence of a payment default.  Many of our debt arrangements, including our unsecured notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured line of credit are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations.  As a result, any default under our debt


covenants may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations, and the market value of our stock.

Increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations.

Although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facility and term loan.  As of December 31, 2019, 6.5% of our outstanding debt was variable rate debt not hedged to fixed.  Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates.  In addition, increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures, to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates.  This would reduce our future earnings and cash flows, which may adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also may reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders.

Hedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which may adversely affect us.

We manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements.  These arrangements involve risk, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes.  There can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations.  Should we desire to terminate a hedging arrangement, there may be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging arrangement.  In addition, failure to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.

The interest rates on our Unsecured Credit facilities as well as on our variable rate mortgages and interest rate swaps might change based on changes to the method in which LIBOR or its replacement rate is determined.

In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) that regulates LIBOR announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021.  As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts.  We are not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets.  Any changes adopted by FCA or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR.  If that were to occur, our interest payments could change.  In addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in its current form.

We have contracts that are indexed to LIBOR, including our $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, $265 million term loan, and fifteen mortgages within our consolidated and unconsolidated portfolio totaling $225.5 million on a Pro-rata basis, as well as interest rate swaps to fix these variable cash flows with notional amounts totaling $442.0 million on a Pro-rata basis.  These LIBOR based instruments mature between 2020 and 2028.  We are monitoring and evaluating the related risks, which include interest on loans or amounts received and paid on derivative instruments.  These risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to a new alternative rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur.  The value of loans, securities, or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued.  For some instruments, the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging, as they may require negotiation with the respective counterparty.

If a contract is not transitioned to an alternative rate and LIBOR is discontinued, the impact is likely to vary by contract.  If LIBOR is discontinued or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and related interest rate swaps may be adversely affected.

While we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point.  This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator.  In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified.


Risk Factors Related to our Company and the Market Price for Our Securities

Changes in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities.

The market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, many of which are out of our control, including:

•

actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;

•

changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;

•

publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry in general and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;

•

the ability of our tenants to pay rent and meet their other obligations to us under current lease terms and our ability to re-lease space as leases expire;

•

increases in market interest rates that drive purchasers of our stock to demand a higher dividend yield;

•

changes in market valuations of similar companies;

•

adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;

•

any future issuances of equity securities;

•

additions or departures of key management personnel;

•

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;

•

actions by institutional stockholders;

•

reports by corporate governance rating companies;

•

increased investor focus on sustainability-related risks, including climate change;

•

changes in our dividend payments;

•

potential tax law changes on REITs;

•

speculation in the press or investment community; and

•

general market and economic conditions.

These factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects.  It is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities, including our common stock, will not fall in the future.  A decrease in the market price of our common stock may reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets.  Selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders.

There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.

Our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:

•

our financial condition and results of future operations;

•

the terms of our loan covenants; and

•

our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.

If we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities.


Enhanced focus on corporate

responsibility

and sustainability

, specifically related to environmenta

l, social and governance matters

, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.

We, as well as increasing numbers of investors, are focused on corporate responsibility and sustainability, specifically related to environmental, social and governance matters (“ESG”).  Some investors may use these matters to guide their investment strategies.  Third-party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased to meet growing investor demand for measurement of corporate responsibility performance.  Although we have generally scored highly in these metrics to date, there can be no assurance that we will continue to score highly in the future.  In addition, the criteria by which companies are rated may change, which could cause us to receive lower scores than in the past.  We may face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility and sustainability procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies.  Furthermore, should our competitors outperform us in such metrics, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competition instead.  The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the price of our shares and our business, financial condition and results of operations, including increased capital expenditures and/or increased operating expenses.

Risk Factors Related to Laws and Regulations

If the Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.

We believe that the Parent Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT.  If the Parent Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders.  Many REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex.  The determination that the Parent Company is a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances, some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from specific passive sources, like rent, that are itemized in the REIT tax laws.  There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the REIT requirements.  We are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains.  We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.  The fact that we hold many of our assets through co-investment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements.  Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings, that make it more difficult for the Parent Company to remain qualified as a REIT.

Also, unless the IRS granted relief under certain statutory provisions, the Parent Company would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year it first failed to qualify.  If the Parent Company failed to qualify as a REIT (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we would have to pay significant income taxes, reducing cash available to pay dividends, which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. In addition, we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders in order to maintain our REIT status.  Although we believe that the Parent Company qualifies as a REIT, we cannot be assured that the Parent Company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes.

Even if the Parent Company qualifies as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to pay certain federal, state, and local taxes on our income and property.  For example, if we have net income from “prohibited transactions,” that income will be subject to a 100% tax.  In general, prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.  The determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale.  While we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years, we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions, but there can be no assurance that the IRS would not contend otherwise.

New legislation, as well as new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions may be introduced, enacted, or promulgated from time to time, that may change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders.

Recent changes to the U.S. tax laws may have a significant negative impact on the overall economy, our tenants, our investors, and our business.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  While the changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally appear to be favorable with respect to REITs, the extensive changes to non-REIT provisions in the Code may have unanticipated effects on us or our stockholders, including our taxable income, the amount of distributions to our stockholders required in order to maintain our REIT status, and our relative tax advantage as a REIT.  The long-term impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the overall economy, government revenues, our tenants, us, and the real estate industry cannot be reliably predicted at this stage of the new law’s implementation.  Furthermore, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may negatively impact certain of our tenants’ operating results, financial condition, and future business plans.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may also


result in reduced government revenues, and therefore reduced government spending, which may negatively impact some of our tenants that rely on government funding.

There can be no assurance that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will not

adversely

impact our operating results, financial condition, and future business operations.

Dividends paid by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.

Subject to limited exceptions, dividends paid by REITs (other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends, qualified dividends or returns of capital) are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by “C” corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates.  The more favorable tax rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends may cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which may adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including the shares of our capital stock.

Under the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the rate brackets for non-corporate taxpayer’s ordinary income are adjusted, the top tax rate is reduced from 39.6% to 37% (excluding the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income), and ordinary REIT dividends are taxed at even lower effective rates.  Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, distributions from REITs that are treated as dividends but are not designated as qualified dividends or capital gain dividends are generally taxed as ordinary income after deducting 20% of the amount of the dividend in the case of non-corporate stockholders.  At the maximum ordinary income tax rate of 37% applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, the maximum tax rate on ordinary REIT dividends for non-corporate stockholders is generally 29.6% (plus the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income).

Certain foreign stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a “domestically controlled” REIT.

A foreign person disposing of a U.S. real property interest, including shares of a U.S. corporation whose assets consist principally of U.S. real property interests is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition.  This tax does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a REIT if the REIT is “domestically controlled.”  In general, we will be a domestically controlled REIT if at all times during the five-year period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock, less than 50% in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons.  If we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled REIT, gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock.

Legislative or other actions affecting REITs may have a negative effect on us.

The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, may adversely affect Regency or our investors.  We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect Regency or our investors.  New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us.  Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, may change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.

Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.

The REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities.  Generally, income from a hedging transaction that constitutes “qualifying income” for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests applicable to REITs, does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the Code and Treasury Regulations.  To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, or fail to make the proper tax identifications, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests.  As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”).

Restrictions on the ownership of the Parent Company's capital stock to preserve its REIT status may delay or prevent a change in control.

Ownership of more than 7% by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited, with certain exceptions, by the Parent Company's articles of incorporation, for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a REIT.  This 7% limitation may discourage a change in control and may also (i) deter tender offers for our capital stock, which offers may be attractive to our stockholders, or (ii) limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7% of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control.


The issuance of the Parent Company's capital stock may delay or prevent a change in control.

The Parent Company's articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 10,000,000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued.  The issuance of preferred stock or special common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.  The provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act regarding affiliated transactions may also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders.

Barneys filed for bankruptcy in July 2019.  Lease income for Barneys is being recognized on a cash basis effective June 30, 2019 and the lease is expected to terminate in February 2020.

Our leases for tenant space under 10,000 square feet generally have initial terms ranging from three to seven years.  Leases greater than 10,000 square feet generally have initial lease terms in excess of five years, mostly comprised of anchor tenants.  Many of the anchor leases contain provisions allowing the tenant the option of extending the term of the lease at expiration.  Our leases typically provide for the payment of fixed base rent, the tenant's Pro-rata share of real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance (“CAM”) expenses, and reimbursement for utility costs if not directly metered.


The following table summarizes

Pro-rata

lease expirations for the next ten years and thereafter, for our Consolidated and Unconsolidated Properties, assuming no tenants renew their leases (GLA and dollars in thousands):

(1)

Leases currently under month-to-month rent or in process of renewal.

During 2020, we have a total of 1,097 leases expiring, representing 3.3 million square feet of GLA.  These expiring leases have an average base rent of $24.13 PSF.  The average base rent of new leases signed during 2019 was $28.38 PSF.  During periods of economic weakness or when occupancy is low, tenants have more bargaining power, which may result in rental rate declines on new or renewal leases.  In periods of recovery and/or when occupancy levels are high, landlords have more bargaining power, which generally results in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases.  Based on current economic trends and expectations, the quality and mix of tenants in our centers, and Pro-rata percent leased of 94.8%, we expect average base rent on new and renewal leases during 2020 to meet or exceed average rental rates on leases expiring in 2020.  Exceptions may arise in certain geographic areas or at specific shopping centers based on the local economic situation, competition, location, quality, and size of the space being leased, among other factors.  Additionally, significant changes or uncertainties affecting micro- or macroeconomic climates may cause significant changes to our current expectations.

Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Since November 13, 2018, our common stock has traded on NASDAQ under the symbol “REG.”  Before November 13, 2018, our common stock traded on the NYSE, also under the symbol “REG.”

As of February 7, 2020, there were 65,795 holders of common equity.

We intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to Regency Centers Corporation's common stockholders.  Future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon cash generated by operating activities, our financial condition, capital requirements, annual dividend requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant.  In order to maintain Regency Centers Corporation's qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are generally required to make annual distributions at least equal to 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year.  Under certain circumstances, which we do not expect to occur, we could be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distributions in order to meet such requirements.  We have a dividend reinvestment plan under which shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividends automatically in common stock.  Under the plan, we may elect to purchase common stock in the open market on behalf of shareholders or may issue new common stock to such stockholders.

Under the revolving credit agreement of our line of credit, in the event of any monetary default, we may not make distributions to stockholders except to the extent necessary to maintain our REIT status.

There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the quarter ended December 31, 2019.

The following table represents information with respect to purchases by the Parent Company of its common stock during the months in the three month period ended December 31, 2019:

Represents shares repurchased to cover payment of withholding taxes in connection with restricted stock vesting by participants under Regency's Long-Term Omnibus Plan.

(2)

On February 4, 2020, the Company's Board authorized a new common share repurchase program under which the Company may purchase, from time to time, up to a maximum of $250 million of its outstanding common stock through open market purchases and/or in privately negotiated transactions.  Any shares purchased will be retired.  The program is scheduled to expire on February 5, 2021.  No shares have been repurchased under this new share repurchase program and no shares have been purchased under the program that expired in 2020.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Executing on our Strategy

We had Net income attributable to the Company of $239.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $249.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.

We sustained same property NOI growth:

•

We attained Pro-rata same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, of 2.1%.

•

We executed 1,702 leasing transactions representing 6.1 million Pro-rata SF of new and renewal leasing with trailing twelve month rent spreads of 8.5% on comparable retail operating property spaces.

•

At December 31, 2019, our total property portfolio was 94.8% leased while our same property portfolio was 95.1% leased.

We continued our development and redevelopment of high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment:

•

We started a new development representing a total Pro-rata investment of $27.3 million upon completion with a projected return on investment of 6.0%.

•

We started 11 new redevelopments representing a total incremental Pro-rata investment of $237.2 million upon completion with a weighted average projected return on investment of 6.9%, including $74.7 million for two future phases at Serramonte Center.

•

Including these projects, a total of 22 properties were in the process of development or redevelopment as of December 31, 2019 representing a Pro-rata investment upon completion of $350.8 million.

•

We completed six new developments during 2019 representing a total Pro-rata investment of $223.2 million with a weighted average return on investment of 7.2%.

•

We completed three new redevelopments during 2019 representing a total incremental Pro-rata investment of $7.6 million with a weighted average return on investment of 7.0%.

We maintained a conservative balance sheet providing financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities:

•

On March 6, 2019, we issued $300.0 million of 4.65% senior unsecured public notes, which priced at 99.661%, and mature in March 2049.  The net proceeds of the offering were used to repay in full our $250 million 4.8% notes due April 15, 2021, including a make-whole premium of approximately $9.6 million and accrued interest.  The remaining proceeds were used toward repaying in full two mortgages for $52.7 million with interest rates ranging between 6.25% and 7.25%, including a repayment premium of $1.0 million.

•

On August 13, 2019, we issued $425.0 million of 2.95% senior unsecured public notes, which priced at 99.903% and mature in September 2029.  The net proceeds of the offering were used to repay in full our $300.0 million term loan that was due to mature in December 2020, including an interest rate swap breakage fee of approximately $1.1 million, and to reduce the outstanding balance on our Line.

•

During September 2019, we entered into forward sale agreements under our ATM program through which we will issue 1,894,845 shares of common stock at an average offering price of $67.99.  The shares under the forward sales agreements may be settled at any time before the required settlement date of September 12, 2020.  Proceeds from the issuance of shares are expected to be used to fund acquisitions of operating properties, to fund developments and redevelopments, and for general corporate purposes.  No shares have been settled through December 31, 2019.

•

At December 31, 2019, our annualized net debt-to-operating EBITDA

re

ratio on a Pro-rata basis was 5.4x.


Leasing Activity and Significant Tenants

We believe our high-quality, grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated, desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants.

Pro-rata Occupancy

The increase in tenant allowance and landlord work committed on new anchor leases signed in 2019 is attributable to

anchor deals

that include costs to either convert units to a specialized use, deliver new GLA

Significant Tenants and Concentrations of Risk

We seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property, market, or tenant.  The following table summarizes our most significant tenants, based on their percentage of annualized base rent:

(1)

Includes Regency's Pro-rata share of Unconsolidated Properties and excludes those owned by anchors.

Bankruptcies and Credit Concerns

Our management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring retail trends, consumer preferences, customer shopping behaviors, changes in retail delivery methods, and changing demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting the retail industry.  A greater shift to e-commerce could negatively impact our tenants’ sales potentially resulting in large scale business failures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We seek to mitigate these potential impacts through tenant diversification, replacing weaker tenants with stronger operators, anchoring our centers with market leading grocery stores that drive foot traffic, and maintaining a presence in affluent suburbs and dense infill trade areas.  As a result of our research and findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail allowances for construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer in order to reduce our risk from bankruptcies and store closings.

We closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of tenants in our shopping centers as well as those retailers experiencing significant changes to their business models as a result of reduced customer traffic in their stores and increased competition from e-commerce sales.  Retailers that are unable to withstand these and other business pressures, such as significant debt maturities, may file for bankruptcy.  Although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants filing for bankruptcy protection generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores.  Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims.  As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold.  For operating leases in which collectability of lease income is not probable, lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized lease income is reversed in the period in which the lease income is determined not to be probable of collection.  Additionally, we may incur significant expense to adjudicate our claim and to release the vacated space.  In the event that a tenant with a significant amount of annualized base rent files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues.  Tenants who are currently in bankruptcy and continue to occupy space in our shopping centers at December 31, 2019, represent an aggregate of 0.6% of our annual base rent on a Pro-rata basis, which includes 0.5% for the 57,000 square foot Barneys’ space in New York.  The Barneys’ lease is expected to terminate in February 2020.


Results from Operations

Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and

2018:

Our revenues changed as summarized in the following table:

(1)

As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regency adopted ASC Topic 842,

Leases

, using the modified retrospective adoption method as of January 1, 2019, and elected to apply the transition provisions of the standard at the beginning of the period of adoption.  As such, the prior period amounts prepared and presented under the former ASC Topic 840,

Leases

, were not restated, but were reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.  Part of the practical expedients in ASC Topic 842 allow management to avoid separating lease and non-lease components of Lease income, therefore all lease income earned pursuant to tenant leases, including recoveries from tenants and percentage rent, in 2019 and as reclassified for 2018 and 2017, is reflected in Lease income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Lease income increased $10.5 million, driven by the following contractually billable components of rent from tenants per the lease agreements:

$12.6 million increase from billable Base rent, as follows:

•

$12.4 million increase from rent commencing at development properties;

•

$6.2 million increase from acquisitions of operating properties; and

•

$13.5 million net increase from same properties due to rental rate growth on new and renewal leases and rent steps in existing leases; reduced by

•

$19.5 million decrease from the sale of operating properties.

$1.8 million increase from billable Recoveries from tenants, which represents amounts contractually billable to tenants per the terms of the lease for their reimbursement to us for the tenants’ Pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers.  Recoveries from tenants increased, on a net basis, as follows:

•

$4.0 million increase from rent commencing at development properties; and

•

$3.5 million increase from acquisitions of operating properties; reduced by

•

$520,000 decrease from same properties, due to a net decrease in the amount of recoverable expenses; and

•

$5.2 million decrease from the sale of operating properties.

$8.7 million decrease in Straight-line rent driven by a $4.8 million decrease for known or expected early lease terminations and a $3.9 million net decrease driven by timing of contractual rent steps.

$10.5 million increase in Above and below market rent accretion, as follows:

•

$2.8 million increase primarily driven by accelerated below-market rent accretion for an early lease termination at a recently acquired property;

•

$7.4 million increase from same properties primarily driven by $8.8 million of accelerated below-market rent accretion for expected early lease terminations; and

•

$352,000 increase from the sale of operating properties, which had greater above market rent amortization in 2018.

$5.4 million decrease related to uncollectible lease income recorded as a direct charge against Lease income beginning on January 1, 2019, with the adoption of ASC 842,

Leases

.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, uncollectible lease income of $5.0 million was recorded as Provision for doubtful accounts included in Other operating expenses below.


Management, transaction and other fees increased $

million

primarily

due to an increase in development fees from

unconsolidated partnerships

.

Changes in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table:

(1)

Beginning with the adoption of ASC 842,

Leases

, on January 1, 2019, uncollectible lease income is a direct charge against Lease income, which totaled $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Depreciation and amortization costs changed as follows:

•

$5.8 million increase as we began depreciating costs at development properties where tenant spaces were completed and became available for occupancy;

•

$8.9 million net increase from acquisitions of operating properties; and

•

$10.6 million net increase at same properties, primarily attributable to additional depreciation at redevelopment properties; reduced by

•

$10.7 million decrease from the sale of operating properties.

Operating and maintenance costs changed as follows:

•

$3.6 million increase from operations commencing at development properties; and

•

$1.9 million increase at same properties, primarily attributable to $2.7 million of increases in recoverable costs, offset by a reduction in termination fee expense; reduced by

•

$3.7 million decrease from the sale of operating properties.

General and administrative changed as follows:

•

$8.2 million increase due to eliminating capitalization of non-contingent internal leasing costs and legal costs associated with leasing activities upon the adoption of ASC 842,

Leases

, on January 1, 2019; and

•

$6.3 million increase in the value of participant obligations within the deferred compensation plan; reduced by

•

$3.4 million decrease from higher development overhead capitalization based on the timing and size of current development and redevelopment projects; and

•

$1.6 million net decrease in compensation and other corporate overhead costs, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation.


Real estate taxes changed as follows:

•

$2.7 million increase from development properties where capitalization ceased as tenant spaces became available for occupancy; and

•

$1.9 million increase from acquisitions of operating properties; offset by

•

$3.7 million decrease at same properties from successful tax appeals with refunds received in 2019 and 2018 including increases for post-merger tax reassessments; and

•

$2.5 million decrease from the sale of operating properties.

Provision for doubtful accounts was $5.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.  Beginning with the adoption of ASC 842,

Leases

, on January 1, 2019, uncollectible lease income is a direct charge against Lease income.  The uncollectible lease income was $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting changes in collection expectations.

Other operating expenses increased $3.1 million, attributable to environmental remediation costs within our same properties and increased development pursuit costs.

The following table presents the components of other expense (income):

The $2.8 million net increase in total interest expense is primarily due to:

•

$2.1 million net increase in interest on notes payable due to additional unsecured debt offerings to fund the repayment of our $300.0 million term loan and several mortgages;

•

$2.8 million increase from lower capitalization of interest based on the size and progress of development and redevelopment projects in process; reduced by

•

$1.4 million decrease in interest on unsecured credit facilities due to repayment of our $300 million term loan in August 2019; and

•

$0.7 million decrease as a result of a previously settled forward hedge for a ten year unsecured note issuance fully amortizing in early 2019.

During 2019, we recognized $54.2 million of impairment losses, including $3.1 million of goodwill impairment, on six operating properties, three of which have been sold.  During 2018, we recognized $38.4 million of impairment losses, including $12.6 million of goodwill impairment, on ten operating properties and two land parcels, all of which have sold.  One of the remaining three properties that was impaired in 2019 is our 101 7

th

Avenue center in New York, which was occupied by a single retail tenant, Barneys, who filed bankruptcy and is expected to terminate their lease in February 2020.  As a result, management reassessed the expected hold period of the property as well as its highest and best use, resulting in a $40.3 million impairment loss to reduce the carrying value to its estimated fair value.

During 2019, we sold five operating properties and six land parcels for gains totaling $24.2 million.  During 2018, we sold six operating properties and seven land parcels for gains totaling $28.3 million.

Net investment income increased $6.7 million, driven by valuation changes in the stock market, primarily attributable to investments held within the non-qualified deferred compensation plan.


Our equity in income

(losses)

of investment

s in real estate partnerships in

creased as follows:

The $18.0 million increase in total Equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is attributed to:

•

$13.9 million increase within GRIR primarily due to our share of gains on the sale of two operating properties;

•

$10.5 million decrease within NYC due to a provision for impairments of real estate resulting from changes in the expected hold periods of various properties;

•

$2.9 million decrease within Columbia II due to our share of 2018 gain on the sale of an operating property;

•

$2.3 million increase within RegCal due to our share of 2019 gains on the sale of one operating property; and

•

$14.7 million increase in Other investments in real estate partnerships due to the sale of our ownership interest in a single operating property partnership.

The following represents the remaining components that comprise net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders:

Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

For a comparison of our results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2019.


Supplemental Earnings Information

We use certain non-GAAP performance measures, in addition to certain performance metrics determined under GAAP, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operating results.  We provide Pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships, when read in conjunction with the Company’s reported results under GAAP.  We believe presenting our Pro-rata share of operating results, along with other non-GAAP measures, may assist in comparing the Company's operating results to other REITs.  We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.  See “Defined Terms” in Part I, Item 1.

Pro-rata Same Property NOI:

Our Pro-rata same property NOI changed as follows:

(1)

Represents amounts included within Lease income, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and further discussed in Note 1, that are contractually billable to the tenant per the terms of the lease agreements.

(2

)

Beginning with the adoption of ASC 842,

Leases

, on January 1, 2019, uncollectible lease income is a direct charge against Lease income.  Provision for doubtful accounts was included in Total real estate operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Billable Base rent increased $15.2 million, driven by increases in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases and contractual rent steps in existing leases, partially offset by a decline in rent paying occupancy.

Operating and maintenance costs increased $3.6 million due to increases in recoverable costs, including insurance, security, and property maintenance, offset by decreases in snow removal costs.

Termination expense decreased $1.2 million due to more significant costs in 2018 to terminate specific tenant leases.

Real estate taxes decreased $3.5 million due to successful supplemental tax appeal receipts at certain properties in 2019.  In addition, 2018 included higher real estate tax expense related to supplemental tax bills received from the 2017 merger with Equity One.


Same Property Rollforward:

Our same property pool includes the following property count, Pro-rata GLA, and changes therein:

(1)

SF adjustments arise from remeasurements or redevelopments.

NAREIT FFO:

Our reconciliation of net income attributable to common stock and unit holders to NAREIT FFO is as follows:

(1)

Includes Regency's Pro-rata share of unconsolidated investment partnerships, net of Pro-rata share attributable to noncontrolling interests.

(2)

Effective January 1, 2019, Regency prospectively adopted the NAREIT FFO White Paper – 2018 Restatement, and elected the option of excluding gains on sales and impairments of land, which are considered incidental to the Company’s main business.  Prior period amounts were not restated to conform to the current year presentation of NAREIT FFO, and therefore 2018 includes $6.7 million of gains on sale of land and $542,000 of provision for impairment to land.


Reconciliation of Same Property NOI to Nearest GAAP Measure:

Our reconciliation of Net income attributable to common stockholders to Same Property NOI, on a Pro-rata basis, is as follows:

(1)

Includes straight-line rental income and expense, net of reserves, above and below market rent amortization, other fees, and noncontrolling interest.

(2)

Provision for doubtful accounts is applicable only to 2018 amounts.  Beginning January 1, 2019, with the adoption of Topic 842,

Leases

, uncollectible amounts are presented net within Lease income.

(3)

Includes non-NOI expenses incurred at our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, including those separated out above for our consolidated properties.

(4)

Includes revenues and expenses attributable to non-same property, sold property, development properties, corporate activities, and noncontrolling interests.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

We use cash flows generated from operating, investing, and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet, finance our development and redevelopment projects, fund our investment activities, and maintain financial flexibility.  We continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt or equity, to repay maturing debt, or fund our capital commitments.

Except for $500 million of unsecured public and private placement debt, our Parent Company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our Operating Partnership.  All remaining debt is held by our Operating Partnership or by our co-investment partnerships.  The Operating Partnership is a co-issuer and a guarantor of the $500 million of outstanding debt of our Parent Company.  The Parent Company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional partnership units.  Based upon our available sources of capital, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties we own, we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs.

In addition to our $113.0 million of unrestricted cash at December 31, 2019, we have the following additional sources of capital available:

(1)

We have 1,894,845 shares pledged under a Forward Equity Offering that must settle by September 12, 2020 at an average offering price of $67.99 per share before any underwriting discount and offering expenses.

(2)

Net of letters of credit.

(3)

The Company has the option to extend the maturity for two additional six-month periods.


Our dividend distribution policy is

set by our Board of Directors, who monitors our financial position.

Our Board of Directors recently declared a common stock dividend

of

$0.59


per share, payable on March


, 2020

, to shareholders of record as of

February 2


, 2020

.

Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our Board

of Directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability.

We plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

We expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our dividend distributions.  We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $621.3 million and $610.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  We paid $391.6 million and $376.8 million to our common stock and unit holders for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

We estimate that we will require capital during the next twelve months of approximately $391.2 million to fund construction and related costs for in-process developments and redevelopments, to repay maturing debt, and to make capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships.  We expect to generate the necessary cash to fund our capital needs from future cash flow from operations after dividends paid, borrowings from our Line, proceeds from the sale of real estate, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity or the issuance of new debt.

If we start new developments or redevelopments, commit to new acquisitions, prepay debt prior to maturity, or repurchase shares of our common stock, our cash requirements will increase.  In addition, at December 31, 2019, we had an agreement related to our ownership interest in the Town and Country Center in Los Angeles, CA, to purchase an additional 16.62% ownership interest in this center for approximately $18.1 million.  We closed on the purchase in January 2020.

We endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets.  As of December 31, 2019, 88.6% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered. Such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the Line.

Our annualized Fixed charge coverage ratio, including our Pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 4.3 times and 4.2 times for the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Our Line, Term Loan, and unsecured debt require that we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described in note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We are in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2019, and expect to remain in compliance.

Summary of Cash Flow Activity

The following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating, investing, and financing activities of the Company:

Net cash provided by operating activities:

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $10.9 million due to:

•

$2.0 million

increase in operating cash flow distributions from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships; and,

•

$17.1 million

net increase in cash due to timing of cash receipts and payments related to operating activities; offset by

•

$1.3 million

decrease in cash from operating income; and,

•

$6.9 million decrease from cash paid to settle treasury rate locks in 2019 to hedge changes in interest rates on our 30 year fixed rate debt offering completed during 2019 and to settle an interest rate swap on the repayment of our $300 million term loan during 2019.


Net cash used in investing activities:

Net cash used in investing activities changed by $176.7 million as follows:

Significant investing and divesting activities included:

•

We acquired four operating properties for $222.4 million during 2019 and three operating properties for $85.3 million during 2018.

•

We invested $26.2 million less in 2019 than 2018 on real estate development, redevelopment, and capital improvements, as further detailed in a table below.

•

We received proceeds of $137.6 million from the sale of seven shopping centers and six land parcels in 2019, compared to $250.4 million for ten shopping centers and nine land parcels in 2018.

•

We received property insurance claim proceeds of $9.4 million during 2019 attributable to a single property that was severely damaged by a tornado in the current year.

•

We received $15.6 million upon the collection of two notes in 2018.

•

We invested $66.9 million in our real estate partnerships during 2019, including:

o

$44.3 million to fund our share of development and redevelopment activities,

o

$9.7 million to fund our share of acquiring an additional equity interest in one partnership,

o

$8.2 million to fund our share of acquiring land under one shopping center that was previously under a ground lease, and

o

$4.7 million to fund our share of repayments for maturing debt.

During the same period in 2018, we invested $74.2 million in our real estate partnerships, including:

o

$48.8 million to fund our share of acquiring four operating properties,

o

$21.9 million to fund our share of development and redevelopment activities,

o

$1.3 million to acquire an interest in one land parcel for development, and

o

$2.2 million to fund our share of maturing debt.

•

Distributions from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships include return of capital from sales or financing proceeds.  The $63.7 million received in 2019 is driven by the sale of three operating properties, the sale of our ownership interest in a single operating property partnership, and our share of proceeds from debt financing activities.  During the same period in 2018, we received $14.6 million from the sale of one land parcel and one operating property plus our share of proceeds from debt financing activities.

•

Dividends on securities, acquisition of securities, and proceeds from sale of securities pertain to investment activities held in our captive insurance company and our deferred compensation plan.


We plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for long-term investment purposes.

During


, we deployed capital of

$200.0 million

for the development, redevelopment, and improvement of our real estate properties as comprised of the following:

•

During 2019, we acquired two land parcels for new development and redevelopment projects as compared to three land parcels during 2018.

•

Building and tenant improvements decreased $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to the timing of capital projects.

•

Redevelopment expenditures were higher during 2019 due to the timing, magnitude, and number of projects in process.  We intend to continuously improve our portfolio of shopping centers through redevelopment which can include adjacent land acquisition, existing building expansion, façade renovations, new out-parcel building construction, and redevelopment related tenant improvement costs.  The size and magnitude of each redevelopment project varies with each redevelopment plan.  The timing and duration of these projects, which generally includes tenant vacancies before and during the redevelopment, could also result in volatility in NOI.  See the tables below for more details about our redevelopment projects.

•

Development expenditures were lower in 2019 based on the progress towards completion of our development projects in process.  At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had three and six consolidated development projects, respectively, that were either under construction or in lease up.  See the tables below for more details about our development projects.

•

Interest is capitalized on our development and redevelopment projects and is based on cumulative actual costs expended.  We cease interest capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business.

•

We have a staff of employees who directly support our development program, which includes redevelopment of our existing properties.  We currently expect that our development and redevelopment activities will approximate our recent historical averages, although the amount of activity by type will vary.  Internal compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project.  Changes in the level of future development activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development projects that may be capitalized.  A 10% reduction in either development or redevelopment activity without a corresponding reduction in related compensation costs could result in an additional charge to net income of $1.5 million per year.


The following table summarizes our development projects:

(1)

Includes leasing costs and is net of tenant reimbursements.

(2)

Estimated Net Development Costs and GLA reported based on Regency’s ownership interest in the partnership at project completion.

(3)

Estimated Net Development Costs for Pinecrest Place exclude the cost of land, which the Company has leased long term.

The following table summarizes our redevelopment projects:

(1)

Includes leasing costs and is net of tenant reimbursements.


Net cash used in

financing activities:

Net cash flows used in financing activities changed during 2019, as follows:

Significant financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 include the following:

•

We repurchased for cash a portion of the common stock granted to employees for stock based compensation to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements, which totaled $6.2 million and $6.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

•

We paid $32.8 million to repurchase 563,229 common shares through our prior share repurchase program that were executed in December 2018 but not settled until January 2019.  During 2018, we paid $213.9 million to repurchase 3,689,104 common shares through our repurchase program.

•

Net distributions to limited partners in consolidated partnerships decreased by $1.2 million primarily due to contributions made by a new limited partner during 2019.

•

We paid $14.9 million more in dividends during 2019 as a result of an increase in our dividend rate from $2.22 per share during 2018 to $2.34 per share during 2019, partially offset by the reduced shares outstanding during 2019 resulting from our common stock repurchases executed during 2018.

•

We had the following debt related activity during 2019:

o

We borrowed, net of repayments, an additional $75.0 million on our Line.

o

We received total proceeds of $723.6 million upon the issuance of two senior unsecured public note offerings during 2019.

o

We paid $624.7 million for other debt repayments, including:

▪

$259.6 million to redeem our senior unsecured public notes originally due April 2021;

▪

$300 million for repayment of a term loan originally due December 2020;

▪

$53.7 million to repay two mortgages; and

▪

$12.4 million in principal mortgage payments.

o

We paid $7.0 million of loan costs in connection with our two public note offerings above.


•

We had the following debt related activity during


:

o

We borrowed, net of payments, an additional $85.0 million on our Line.

o

We received proceeds of $301.3 million from debt issuances, including $299.5 million of senior unsecured public notes and $1.7 million from construction loan draws used to fund an in-process development project.

o

We paid $283.5 million for other debt payments, including $160.5 million to early redeem our senior unsecured public notes originally due June 2020, $113 million to repay four mortgages, and $10 million in scheduled principal mortgage payments.

o

We paid $9.4 million of loan costs in connection with our public note offering above and expanding our Line commitment.

Contractual Obligations

We have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans, unsecured notes, unsecured credit facilities, interest rate swap obligations, and lease agreements as described further below and in note 7, note 9, and note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center.  We also have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business.  In addition, at December 31, 2019, we had a contractual commitment to purchase an additional 16.62% ownership interest in our Town and Country shopping center, bringing our ownership interest to 35%.  We closed on the purchase in January 2020 for $18.1 million.

The following table of Contractual Obligations summarizes our debt maturities, including our Pro-rata share of obligations within co-investment partnerships as of December 31, 2019, and excludes the following:

•

Recorded debt premiums or discounts and issuance costs that are not obligations;

•

Obligations related to construction or development contracts, since payments are only due upon satisfactory performance under the contracts;

•

Letters of credit of $12.5 million issued to cover our captive insurance program and performance obligations on certain development projects, which the latter will be satisfied upon completion of the development projects; and

•

Obligations for retirement savings plans due to uncertainty around timing of participant withdrawals, which are solely within the control of the participant, and are further discussed in note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1)

Includes interest payments.

(2)

We are obligated to contribute our Pro-rata share to fund maturities if they are not refinanced.  We believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements. In the event that a co-investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co-investment partnership, we would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call.


Critical Accounting Estimates

Knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements.  The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period.  These accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical and expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards.  They are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates.  We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.

Accounts Receivable and Straight Line Rent

Lease income, which includes base rent, percentage rent, and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are the Company's principal source of revenue.  As a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants.  Additionally, we recognize Lease income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, which generally results in straight line rent receivable for future contractual rent steps.

Lease income for operating leases with fixed payment terms is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease for all leases for which collectibility is considered probable at the commencement date.  At lease commencement, the Company generally expects that collectibility is probable due to the Company’s credit assessment of tenants and other creditworthiness analysis undertaken before entering into a new lease; therefore, income from most operating leases is initially recognized on a straight-line basis.  For operating leases in which collectibility of Lease income is not considered probable, Lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized uncollectible Lease income is reversed in the period in which the Lease income is determined not to be probable of collection.  In addition to the lease-specific collectibility assessment performed under Topic 842, the Company also recognizes a general reserve, as a reduction to Lease income, for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the Company’s historical collection experience.  Although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.

Real Estate Investments

Acquisition of Real Estate Investments

Upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date.  Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities.  Transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions are capitalized, while such costs are expensed for business combinations in the period incurred.  Beginning in July 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update 2017-01,

Business Combinations (Topic 805):  Clarifying the Definition of a Business

, under which the acquisition of operating properties are generally considered asset acquisitions.  If, however, the acquisition is determined to be a business combination, any excess consideration above the fair value allocated to the applicable assets and liabilities results in goodwill.  Fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The Company's methodology for determining fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities includes estimating an “as-if vacant” fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements.  In addition, the Company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases.

The value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period.  The value of in-place leases is recorded to Depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the remaining expected term of the respective leases.

Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.  The value of above-market leases is amortized as a reduction of Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of below-market leases is accreted to Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.

Changes to these assumptions could result in a different pattern of recognition.  If tenants do not remain in their lease through the expected term or exercise an assumed renewal option, there could be a material impact to earnings.


Development and Redevelopment of Real Estate Assets and Cost Capitalization

We have a development program, which includes development of new shopping centers and redevelopment of our existing shopping centers.  We capitalize the acquisition of land, the construction of buildings, and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in Real estate assets, at cost, in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Other specifically identifiable development costs include pre-development costs essential to the development process, as well as, interest, real estate taxes, and direct employee costs incurred during the development period.  Once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy, these indirect costs are no longer capitalized.

•

Pre-development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits, legal, engineering, and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center.  If we determine it is probable that a specific project undergoing due diligence will not be developed, we immediately expense all related capitalized pre-development costs not considered recoverable.

•

Interest costs are capitalized to each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended.  We cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business.  During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we capitalized interest of $4.2 million, $7.0 million, and $7.9 million, respectively, on our development projects.

•

Real estate taxes are capitalized to each development project over the same period as we capitalize interest.

•

We have a staff of employees directly supporting our development and redevelopment program.  All direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project.  The capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring.  During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we capitalized $20.4 million, $17.1 million, and $17.6 million, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program.

Valuation of Real Estate Investments

In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our real estate for impairment whenever there are indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  If such indicators occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, expected leasing activity, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, comparable sales information, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction.  If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.

The fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, as well as the use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach.  Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore is subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.  Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.

We evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators, including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired.  An investment in a real estate partnership is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an other-than-temporary basis.  Cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors, such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors.  We consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary.  These factors include the age of the real estate partnerships, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, and the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity.  If we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, no impairment charge is recorded.  If our analysis indicates that there is an other-than-temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership, the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining primarily to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, underground petroleum storage tanks, and other historic land use practices.  We believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations.  Generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems.  Where available, we have been accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs.  We have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination.  We have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk.  We monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites.  We also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.

As of December 31, 2019, we and our Investments in real estate partnerships had accrued liabilities of $9.4 million for our Pro-rata share of environmental remediation.  We believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations; however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities, not previously discussed.  Many of our unconsolidated investment partnerships’ operating properties have been financed with non-recourse loans, to which we have no repayment guarantees.

Inflation/Deflation

Inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, inflation may become a greater concern in the near future.  Most all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation, which require tenants to pay their Pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.  In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates.  However, during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness, base rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines.  Occupancy declines will result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses.


Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk:

•

We have a Line commitment, as further described in note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which has a variable interest rate that is based upon an annual rate of LIBOR plus 0.875%. LIBOR rates charged on our Line change monthly and the spread on the Line is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings.  If our credit ratings are downgraded, the spread on the Line would increase, resulting in higher interest costs.  The interest rate spread based on our credit rating ranges from LIBOR plus 0.700% to LIBOR plus 1.550%.

•

We are also exposed to changes in interest rates when we refinance our existing long-term fixed rate debt.  The objective of our interest rate risk management program is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows.  To achieve these objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument.  We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.  Our interest rate swaps are structured solely for the purpose of interest rate protection.

We continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt, to repay maturing debt, or fund our commitments.  Based upon the current capital markets, our credit ratings, our capacity under our unsecured credit facilities, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings, we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund maturing debt obligations.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques.  The table below presents the principal cash flows, weighted average interest rates of remaining debt, and the fair value of total debt as of December 31, 2019.  For variable rate mortgages and unsecured credit facilities for which we have interest rate swaps in place to fix the interest rate, they are included in the Fixed rate debt section below at their all-in fixed rate.  The table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes.  Although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table, those rates represent rates that existed as of December 31, 2019, and are subject to change on a monthly basis.  In addition, the Company continually assesses the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.6 million per year based on $35.1 million of floating rate mortgage debt and $220.0 million of floating rate line of credit balance outstanding at December 31, 2019.  If the Company increases its line of credit balance in the future, additional decreases to future earnings and cash flows could occur.

Further, the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2019, and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date. Since firm commitments are not presented, the table has limited predictive value.  As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time, and actual interest rates.

The table below presents the principal cash flow payments associated with our outstanding debt by year, weighted average interest rates on debt outstanding at each year-end, and fair value of total debt as of December 31, 2019.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

Regency Centers Corporation:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regency Centers Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III – Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 14, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842,

Leases

.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Evaluation of real estate properties for impairment

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and presented on the consolidated balance sheet, real estate assets, less accumulated depreciation was $9.3 billion as of December 31, 2019. The Company evaluates real estate properties for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the real estate properties may not be recoverable. To the extent that the carrying value of a real estate property exceeds the estimate of its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over its fair value. Fair value of real estate properties is determined through a comparable sales approach or a discounted cash flow approach. As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company determined that one property’s carrying value exceeded its fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis, and recorded an impairment charge of $40.3 million.


We identified the evaluation of real estate properties for impairment as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the Company’s judgments regarding the identification of potential indicators that the carrying value of the real estate properties may not be recoverable involved a high degree of subjective auditor judgment. Changes in assumptions regarding property conditions, occupancy rates, net operating income, and anticipated hold periods could have an impact on the determination of the existence of impairment indicators and the need to further evaluate the real estate properties for impairment. In addition, the evaluation of the fair value of the real estate property that resulted in the $40.3 million impairment charge, in particular, the key assumptions over the property’s highest and best use, terminal capitalization rate, and the hold period, required a high degree of auditor judgment. The evaluation of these key assumptions required an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge

.

The primary procedures we performed to address these critical audit matters included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s process to evaluate real estate properties for impairment, including the identification of potential indicators of impairment and the fair value measurement of impaired real estate properties. Internal controls tested included the evaluation of changes in property condition, occupancy rates, net operating income and anticipated hold periods, as well as the development of the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis. Using property financial information, we performed an independent assessment of changes in occupancy rates and net operating income for individual real estate properties and compared the results to the Company’s assessment. In addition, to identify a change in property condition or a shortened hold period we inquired of Company officials, attended Company quarterly meetings and inspected documents such as meeting minutes of the board of directors. With respect to the property impairment, our valuation professionals evaluated the Company’s highest and best use conclusion for the impaired property based on the location of the property and current market conditions. Further, our valuation professionals independently developed an estimated range of fair values for the property based on market information and published third-party industry reports with consideration of property specific factors such as location and development requirements. We compared the Company’s estimated fair value of the impaired property to the range of fair values independently developed by our valuation professionals.

Evaluation of the discount rates used to initially measure the operating lease liabilities upon adoption of ASC 842.

As discussed in Note 1 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s operating lease liabilities related to leases of land upon adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019, were approximately $204 million. To measure the operating lease liabilities for the Company’s 22 properties with ground leases, it is necessary for the Company to determine a discount rate for each operating lease and apply that discount rate to the remaining unpaid minimum rental payments for each lease.

We identified the evaluation of the discount rates used to initially measure the operating lease liabilities related to leases of land upon adoption of ASC 842 as a critical audit matter. The Company determined that the rates implicit in the lease contracts were not readily determinable and therefore developed discount rates using Company and market-based interest rates that correspond with the remaining term of the respective leases. The Company made adjustments to those market-based interest rates to reflect the Company’s credit spread and collateralized payment terms present in the respective leases. Evaluating the information used to develop the discount rates and the adjustments made to the market-based interest rates required auditor judgment and the use of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s process for developing the discount rates. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the Company’s discount rates. The valuation professionals independently developed a range of reasonable discount rates using market-based interest rates for the Company and other similar companies, and then made adjustments to those market-based interest rates to reflect the maturities of the respective leases, level of collateral, and the Company’s credit spread. We evaluated the discount rates used by the Company by comparing those rates to the ranges of discount rates independently developed by the valuation professionals.

Regency Centers Corporation:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Regency Centers Corporation’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III – Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 14, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Organization and Principles of Consolidation

General

Regency Centers Corporation (the “Parent Company”) began its operations as a REIT in 1993 and is the general partner of Regency Centers, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”).  The Parent Company primarily engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, development and redevelopment of shopping centers through the Operating Partnership, has no other assets other than through its investment in the Operating Partnership, and its only liabilities are $


million of unsecured public and private placement notes, which are co-issued and guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.  The Parent Company guarantees all of the unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership.

As of  December 31, 2019, the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (the “Company” or “Regency”) owned


properties and held partial interests in an additional


properties through unconsolidated Investments in real estate partnerships (also referred to as “joint ventures” or “co-investment partnerships”).

On March 1, 2017, Regency completed its merger with Equity One, whereby Equity One merged with and into Regency, with Regency continuing as the surviving public company.

Estimates, Risks, and Uncertainties

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The most significant estimates in the Company's financial statements relate to the net carrying values of its real estate investments, collectability of accounts receivable and straight line rent receivable, goodwill, and acquired lease intangible assets and acquired lease intangible liabilities.  It is possible that the estimates and assumptions that have been utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements could change significantly if economic conditions were to weaken.

Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and consolidated partnerships in which the Company has a controlling interest.  Investments in real estate partnerships not controlled by the Company are accounted for under the equity method.  All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

The Company consolidates properties that are wholly owned or properties where it owns less than 100%, but which it has control over the activities most important to the overall success of the partnership.  Control is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of VIEs and voting interest entities.  For joint ventures that are determined to be a VIE, the Company consolidates the entity where it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

Ownership of the Parent Company

The Parent Company has a single class of common stock outstanding.

Ownership of the Operating Partnership

The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units.  As of December 31, 2019, the Parent Company owned approximately

99.6

%, or

167,571,218

, of the

168,317,651

outstanding common Partnership Units of the Operating Partnership, with the remaining limited common Partnership Units held by third parties (“Exchangeable operating partnership units” or “EOP units”).  The Parent Company serves as general partner of the Operating Partnership.  The EOP unit holders have limited rights over the Operating Partnership such that they do not have the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnership. As such, the Operating Partnership is considered a VIE, and the Parent Company, which consolidates it, is the primary beneficiary.  The Parent Company's only investment is the Operating Partnership.  Net income and distributions of the Operating Partnership are allocable to the general and limited common Partnership Units in accordance with their ownership percentages.

Real Estate Partnerships

Regency has a partial ownership interest in


properties through partnerships, of which


are consolidated. Regency's partners include institutional investors, other real estate developers and/or operators.  Regency has a variable interest in these entities through its equity interests.  As managing member, Regency maintains the books and records and typically provides leasing and property management to the partnerships.  The Partners’ level of involvement in these partnerships varies from protective decisions (debt, bankruptcy, selling primary asset(s) of business) to involvement in approving leases, operating budgets, and capital budgets.  The assets of these partnerships are restricted to the use of the partnerships and cannot be used by general creditors of the Company.  And similarly, the obligations of these partnerships can only be settled by the assets of these partnerships or additional contributions by the partners.

•

Those partnerships for which the Partners are involved in the day to day decisions and do not have any other aspects that would cause them to be considered VIEs, are evaluated for consolidation using the voting interest model.

o

Those partnerships in which Regency has a controlling financial interest are consolidated and the limited partners’ ownership interest and share of net income is recorded as noncontrolling interest.

o

Those partnerships in which Regency does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for using the equity method and Regency's ownership interest is recognized through single-line presentation as Investments in real estate partnerships, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and Equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Cash distributions of earnings from operations from Investments in real estate partnerships are presented in Cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Cash distributions from the sale of a property or loan proceeds received from the placement of debt on a property included in Investments in real estate partnerships are presented in Cash flows provided by investing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Distributed proceeds from debt refinancing and real estate sales in excess of Regency's carrying value of its investment has resulted in a negative investment balance for one partnership, which is recorded within Accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The net difference in the carrying amount of investments in real estate partnerships and the underlying equity in net assets is accreted to earnings and recorded in Equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations over the expected useful lives of the properties and other intangible assets, which range in lives from


to


years

.

•

Those partnerships for which the Partners only have protective rights are considered VIEs under ASC Topic 810,

Consolidation

. Regency is the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as Regency has power over these partnerships and they operate primarily for the benefit of Regency.  As such, Regency consolidates these entities and reports the limited partners’ interest as noncontrolling interests.


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

The majority of the operations of the VIEs are funded with cash flows generated by the properties, or in the case of developments, with capital contributions or third party construction loans.

The major classes of assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling equity interests held by the Company's consolidated VIEs, exclusive of the Operating Partnership, are as follows:

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling Interests of the Parent Company

The consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company include the following ownership interests held by owners other than the common stockholders of the Parent Company: (i) the limited Partnership Units in the Operating Partnership held by third parties (“Exchangeable operating partnership units”) and (ii) the minority-owned interest held by third parties in consolidated partnerships (“Limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships”).  The Parent Company has included all of these noncontrolling interests in permanent equity, separate from the Parent Company's stockholders' equity, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity.  The portion of net income or comprehensive income attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in net income and comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income of the Parent Company.

In accordance with ASC Topic 480,

Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity

, securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets at the option of the holder, not solely within the control of the issuer, are to be classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests outside of permanent equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Parent Company has evaluated the conditions as specified under ASC Topic 480 as it relates to exchangeable operating partnership units outstanding and concluded that it has the right to satisfy the redemption requirements of the units by delivering unregistered common stock.   Each outstanding exchangeable operating partnership unit is exchangeable for one share of common stock of the Parent Company, and the unit holder cannot require redemption in cash or other assets.

Limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships are not redeemable by the holders.  The Parent Company also evaluated its fiduciary duties to itself, its shareholders, and, as the managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, to the Operating Partnership, and concluded its fiduciary duties are not in conflict with each other or the underlying agreements.  Therefore, the Parent Company classifies such units and interests as permanent equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity.

Noncontrolling Interests of the Operating Partnership

The Operating Partnership has determined that limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships are noncontrolling interests.  Subject to certain conditions and pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company generally has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the other member’s interest or sell its own interest in these consolidated partnerships.  The Operating Partnership has included these noncontrolling interests in permanent capital, separate from partners' capital, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Capital.  The portion of net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in net income and comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements Comprehensive Income of the Operating Partnership.

Revenues and Tenant Receivable

Leasing Income and Tenant Receivables

The Company leases space to tenants under agreements with varying terms that generally provide for fixed payments of base rent, with designated increases over the term of the lease.  Some of the lease agreements contain provisions that provide for additional rents based on tenants' sales volume (“percentage rent”).  Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements.  Additionally, most lease agreements contain provisions for reimbursement of the tenants' share of actual real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance (“CAM”) costs (collectively “Recoverable Costs”) incurred.

Lease terms generally range from

three

to

seven

years

for tenant space under

10,000

square feet (“Shop Space”) and in excess of

five years

for spaces greater than

10,000

square feet (“Anchor Tenants”).  Many leases also provide the option for the tenants to extend their lease beyond the initial term of the lease.  If a tenant does not exercise its option or otherwise negotiate to renew, the lease expires and the lease contains an obligation for the tenant to relinquish its space so it can be leased to a new tenant.  This generally involves some level of cost to prepare the space for re-leasing, which is capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the life of the subsequent lease or the life of the improvement.

On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 842,

Leases,

including all related Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”).  The Company elected to use the alternative modified retrospective transition method provided in ASU 2018-11 (the “effective date method”).  Under this method, the effective date of January 1, 2019 is the date of initial application.  In connection with the adoption of Topic 842, the Company elected a package of practical expedients, transition options, and accounting policy elections as follows:

•

Package of practical expedients is applied to all leases, allowing the Company not to reassess (i) whether expired or existing contracts contain leases under the new definition of a lease, (ii) lease classification for expired or existing leases, and (iii) whether previously capitalized initial direct costs would qualify for capitalization under Topic 842;

•

For land easements, the Company elected not to assess at transition whether any expired or existing land easements are, or contain, leases if they were not previously accounted for as leases under the previous lease accounting standard (Topic 840);

•

Lessor separation and allocation practical expedient - Regency elected, as lessor, to aggregate non-lease components with the related lease component if certain conditions are met, and account for the combined component based on its predominant characteristic, which generally results in combining lease and non-lease components of its tenant lease contracts to a single line shown as Lease income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations; and

•

The Company made an accounting policy election to continue to exclude, from contract consideration, sales tax (and similar taxes) collected from lessees.

The Company's existing leases were not re-evaluated and continue to be classified as operating leases, as per the practical expedient package elected above.  New and modified leases will now require evaluation of specific classification criteria, which, based on the customary terms of the Company's leases, should continue to be classified as operating leases.  However, certain longer-term leases (both lessee and lessor leases) may be classified as direct financing or sales type leases, which may result in selling profit and an accelerated pattern of earnings recognition.  At December 31, 2019, all of the Company’s leases were classified as operating leases.

CAM is a non-lease component of the lease contract under Topic 842, and therefore would be accounted for under Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, and presented separate from Lease income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, based on an allocation of the overall consideration in the lease contract, which is not necessarily the amount that would be billable to the tenants for CAM reimbursements per the terms of the lease contract.  As the timing and pattern of providing the CAM service to the tenant is the same as the timing and pattern of the tenants' use of the underlying lease asset, the Company elected, as part of a practical expedient referred to above, to combine CAM with the remaining lease components, along with tenants' reimbursement of real estate taxes and insurance, and recognize them together as Lease income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Lease income for operating leases with fixed payment terms is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease for all leases for which collectibility is considered probable at the commencement date.  At lease commencement,


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

the Company generally expects that collectibility is probable due to the Company’s credit checks on tenants and other creditworthiness analysis undertaken before entering into a new lease; therefore, income from most operating leases is initially recognized on a straight-line basis.  For operating leases in which collectibility of Lease income is not considered probable, Lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized uncollectible Lease income is reversed in the period in which the Lease income is determined not to be probable of collection.  In additio

n to the lease-specific collecti

bility assessment performed under Topic 842, the Company also recognizes a general reserve, as a reduction to Lease income, for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the Company’s his

torical collection experience.

The following table represents the components of Tenant and other receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets:

(1)

Beginning with the adoption of ASC 842, Leases, on January 1, 2019, uncollectible lease income is a direct charge against Lease income and the related receivable.  Prior to 2019, uncollectible lease income was recorded as Provision for doubtful accounts included in Other operating expenses.

The Company estimates the collectibility of the accounts receivable related to base rents, straight-line rents, expense reimbursements, and other revenue taking into consideration the Company's historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and remaining lease terms.  Beginning with the adoption of ASC 842, Leases, on January 1, 2019, uncollectible lease income is a direct charge against Lease income.  Prior to 2019, uncollectible lease income was recorded as Provision for doubtful accounts included in Other operating expenses and Provision for straight line rent reserve included as a charge to Lease income.

The Company recorded the following provisions for doubtful accounts:

Real Estate Sales

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new accounting guidance for sales of nonfinancial assets (“Subtopic 610-20”).  Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company derecognizes real estate and recognizes a gain or loss on sales of real estate when a contract exists and control of the property has transferred to the buyer.  Control of the property, including controlling financial interest, is generally considered to transfer upon closing through transfer of the legal title and possession of the property.  Any retained noncontrolling interest is measured at fair value.  This change in accounting policy resulted in the recognition, through opening retained

earnings on January 1, 2018, of $

30.9

million of previously deferred gains from property sales to the Company's Investments in real estate partnerships.

Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company recognized profits from sales of real estate under the full accrual method by the Company when: (i) a sale was consummated; (ii) the buyer's initial and continuing investment was adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property; (iii) the Company's receivable, if applicable, was not subject to future subordination; (iv) the Company had transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership; and (v) the Company did not have substantial continuing involvement with the property.

December 31, 2019

Management Services

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition (Topic 606

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, “Topic 606”) using a modified retrospective approach and applied the transition practical expedients allowed by the standard.

Subsequent to the adoption of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when or as control of the promised services are transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.  The following is a description of the Company's revenue from contracts with customers within the scope of Topic 606.

Property and Asset Management Services

The Company is engaged under agreements with its joint venture partnerships, which are generally perpetual in nature and cancellable through unanimous partner approval, absent an event of default.  Under these agreements, the Company is to provide asset management, property management, and leasing services for the joint ventures' shopping centers.  The fees are market-based, generally calculated as a percentage of either revenues earned or the estimated values of the properties managed or the proceeds received, and are recognized over the monthly or quarterly periods as services are rendered.  Property management and asset management services represent a series of distinct daily services. Accordingly, the Company satisfies its performance obligation as service is rendered each day and the variability associated with that compensation is resolved each day.  Amounts due from the partnerships for such services are paid during the month following the monthly or quarterly service periods.

Several of the Company’s partnership agreements provide for incentive payments, generally referred to as “promotes” or “earnouts,” to Regency for appreciation in property values in Regency's capacity as manager.  The terms of these promotes are based on appreciation in real estate value over designated time intervals.  The Company evaluates its expected promote payout at each reporting period, which generally does not result in revenue recognition until the measurement period has completed, when the amount can be reasonably determined and the amount is not probable of significant reversal.  The Company did not recognize any promote revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.

Leasing Services

Leasing service fees are based on a percentage of the total rent due under the lease.  The leasing service is considered performed upon successful execution of an acceptable tenant lease for the joint ventures’ shopping centers, at which time revenue is recognized.  Payment of the first half of the fee

is generally due upon lease execution and the second half is generally due upon tenant opening or rent payments commencing.

Transaction Services

The Company also receives transaction fees, as contractually agreed upon with each joint venture, which include acquisition fees, disposition fees, and financing service fees. Control of these services is generally transferred at the time the related transaction closes, which is the point in time when the Company recognizes the related fee revenue.  Any unpaid amounts related to transaction-based fees are included in Tenant and other receivables, net, within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

All income from management service contracts is included within Management, transaction and other fees on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Additionally, Other property income, which includes incidental income from the properties, is generally recognized at the point in time that the performance obligation is met.  The primary components of these revenue streams, the timing of satisfying the performance obligations, and amounts recognized are as follows:

The accounts receivable for management services, which is included within Tenant and other receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, are $

11.6

million and $

12.5

million, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

(c)

Real Estate Investments

The following table details the components of Real estate assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

Capitalization and Depreciation

Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the respective assets are recorded in operating and maintenance expense.

As part of the leasing process, the Company may provide the lessee with an allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements.  These leasehold improvements are capitalized and recorded as tenant improvements, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the remaining lease term.  If the allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event the Company is not considered the owner of the improvements, the allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease term as a reduction of Lease income.  Factors considered during this evaluation include, among other things, who holds legal title to the improvements as well as other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement and provisions for substantiation of such costs (e.g. unilateral control of the tenant space during the build-out process).  Determination of the appropriate accounting for the payment of a tenant allowance is made on a lease-by-lease basis, considering the facts and circumstances of the individual tenant lease.

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of approximately


years for land improvements,


years for buildings and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term subject to a maximum of


years for tenant improvements, and

three

to

seven

years

for furniture and equipment.

Development and Redevelopment Costs

Land, buildings, and improvements are recorded at cost.  All specifically identifiable costs related to development and redevelopment activities are capitalized into Real estate assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are included in Construction in progress within the above table.  The capitalized costs include pre-development costs essential to the development or redevelopment of the property, development / redevelopment costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, and allocated direct employee costs incurred during the period of development or redevelopment.  Interest


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

costs are capitalized into each development

and redevelopment

project based upon applying the Company's weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development

or redevelopment

costs expended.

The Company discontinues interest and real estate tax capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would the Company capitalize interest on the project beyond


months

after substantial completion of the building shell.

Pre-development costs represent the costs the Company incurs prior to land acquisition or pursuing a redevelopment including contract deposits, as well as legal, engineering, and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing or redeveloping a shopping center.  As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had nonrefundable deposits and other pre development costs of approximately $

17.7

million and $

10.6

million, respectively.  If the Company determines that the development or redevelopment of a particular shopping center is no longer probable, any related pre-development costs previously capitalized are immediately expensed.  During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company expensed pre-development costs of approximately $

2.5

million, $

1.9

million, and $

1.5

million, respectively, in Other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Acquisitions

Through June 30, 2017, the Company and its real estate partnerships accounted for operating property acquisitions as business combinations using the acquisition method.  Effective July 1, 2017, upon the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-01:

Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business

, operating property acquisitions are generally considered asset acquisitions.  The Company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred and capitalizes transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions.  Both business combinations and asset acquisitions require that the Company recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the operating property acquired (“acquiree”).

The Company's methodology includes estimating an “as-if vacant” fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements.  In addition, the Company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases.

The value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period.  The value of in-place leases is recorded to Depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the remaining expected term of the respective leases.

Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.  The value of above-market leases is amortized as a reduction of Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of below-market leases is accreted to Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.  The Company does not assign value to customer

relationship intangibles if it has pre-existing business relationships with the major retailers at the acquired property since they do not provide incremental value over the Company's existing relationships.

Held for Sale

The Company classifies land, an operating property, or a property in development as held-for-sale upon satisfaction of the following criteria: (i) management commits to a plan to sell a property (or group of properties), (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such properties, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the property have been initiated, (iv) the sale of the property is probable and transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year, (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale, and (vi) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.  Properties held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.

Impairment

We evaluate whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  For those properties with such indicators, management evaluates recoverability of the property's carrying amount.  Through the evaluation, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.

Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates,

expected leasing activity,

costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.

These key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results.

Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.

To the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.

If such indicators are not identified, management will not assess the recoverability of a property's carrying value.

If a property previously classified as h

eld and used is changed to held

for

sale, the Company estimates fair value, less expected costs to sell, which could cause the Company to determine that the property is impaired.

The fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach.  Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore is subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, the Company generally uses market data and comparable sales information.

A loss in value of investments in real estate partnerships under the equity method of accounting, other than a temporary decline, must be recognized in the period in which the loss occurs.  If management identifies indicators that the value of the Company's investment in real estate partnerships may be impaired, it evaluates the investment by calculating the fair value of the investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected term of the investment.

Tax Basis

The net book basis of the Company's real estate assets exceeds the net tax basis by approximately $

2.8

billion at both December 31, 2019 and 2018, primarily due to the tax free merger with Equity One and inheriting lower carryover tax basis.

(d)

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

Any instruments which have an original maturity of

90 days or less

when purchased are considered cash equivalents.  As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $

2.5

million and $

2.7

million, respectively, of cash was restricted through escrow agreements and certain mortgage loans.

(e)

Other Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price consideration for the Equity One merger over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 350,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

, and allocates its goodwill to its reporting units, which have been determined to be at the individual property level.  The Company performs an impairment evaluation of its goodwill at least annually, in November of each year, or more frequently as triggers occur.

The goodwill impairment evaluation is completed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach.  Under a qualitative approach, the impairment review for goodwill consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, including goodwill.  If a qualitative approach indicates it is more likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit (including goodwill) exceeds its fair value, or if the Company chooses to bypass the qualitative approach for any reporting unit, the Company will perform the quantitative approach described below.

The quantitative approach consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted projected future cash flows and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values, which include the allocated goodwill.  If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company would then recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

Investments

The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date.  The fair value of securities is determined using quoted market prices.

Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.  Debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized through earnings in Investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Debt securities not classified as held to maturity or as trading, are classified as available-for-sale, and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in the determination of comprehensive income and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income and presented within Investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(f)

Deferred Leasing Costs

Deferred leasing costs consist of costs associated with leasing the Company's shopping centers, and are presented net of accumulated amortization.  Such costs are amortized over the period through lease expiration.  If the lease is terminated early, the remaining leasing costs are written off.

The adoption of Topic 842 on January 1, 2019 changed the treatment of leasing costs, such that non-contingent internal leasing and legal costs associated with leasing activities can no longer be capitalized.  The Company, as a lessor, may only defer as initial direct costs the incremental costs of a tenant’s operating lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained.  These costs generally consist of third party broker payments.

(g)

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments.  Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company's borrowings.

All derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.  Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.  Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.  The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.

The Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or forecasted transaction, and the Company designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges generally involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  The Company also utilizes cash flow hedges to lock U.S. Treasury rates in anticipation of future fixed-rate debt issuances.  The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”).  Upon the settlement of a hedge, gains and losses remaining in AOCI are amortized through earnings over the underlying term of the hedged transaction.  The cash receipts or payments related to


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

interest rate swaps are presented in cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions.  The Company assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows and/or forecasted cash flows of the hedged items.

In assessing the valuation of the hedges, the Company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and termination costs at each balance sheet date.  All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.

(h)

Income Taxes

The Parent Company believes it qualifies, and intends to continue to qualify, as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, the Parent Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders are at least equal to REIT taxable income.  Each wholly-owned corporate subsidiary of the Operating Partnership has elected to be a TRS as defined in Section 856(l) of the Code.  The TRS's are subject to federal and state income taxes and file separate tax returns.  As a pass through entity, the Operating Partnership generally does not pay taxes, but its taxable income or loss is reported by its partners, of which the Parent Company, as general partner and approximately

99.6

%

owner, is allocated its Pro-rata share of tax attributes.

The Company accounts for income taxes related to its TRS’s under the asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in

effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is believed that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future taxable income, the reversal of other existing temporary differences, available net operating loss carryforwards, tax planning strategies and recent and projected results of operations in order to make that determination.

In addition, tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.  Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.  The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years (2015 and forward for federal and state) based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law in December 2017.  Key provisions in the Act have significant financial statement effects.  These effects include remeasurement of deferred taxes, recognition of liabilities for taxes on mandatory deemed repatriation and certain other foreign income, and reassessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets.  Because the asset and liability approach under ASC 740 requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment, the effects were recognized in the Company's December 2017 financial statements, even though the effective date of the law for most provisions is January 1, 2018.  The Company calculated the tax impact of the change in tax law.  The revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at the appropriate tax rate resulted in a $

9.7

million benefit recognized in earnings for 2017.  To the extent that all information necessary was not available, prepared or analyzed, companies were allotted a measurement period to make adjustments for the effect of the law.  The Company completed its analysis of the Act during 2018 and recorded an immaterial benefit in earnings.

(i)

Lease Obligations

The Company has certain properties within its consolidated real estate portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties, which are all classified as operating leases.  Accordingly, the Company owns only a long-term leasehold or similar interest in these properties.  The building and improvements constructed on the leased land are capitalized as Real estate assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.

In addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which it conducts its business.   Leasehold improvements are capitalized as tenant improvements, included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.

Upon the adoption of Topic 842, the Company recognized Lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets for its ground and office leases of $

225.4

million at January 1, 2019, and corresponding Right of use assets of $

297.8

million, net of or including the opening balance for straight-line rent and above / below market ground lease intangibles related to these same ground and office leases.  A key input in estimating the Lease liabilities and resulting Right of use assets is establishing the discount rate in the lease, which since the rates implicit in the lease contracts are not readily determinable, requires additional inputs for the longer-term ground leases, including market-based interest rates that correspond with the remaining term of the lease, the Company's credit spread, and a securitization adjustment necessary to reflect the collateralized payment terms present in the lease.  This discount rate is applied to the remaining unpaid minimum rental payments for each lease to measure the operating lease liabilities.

The ground and office lease expenses continue to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases, including management's estimate of expected option renewal periods.  For ground leases, the Company generally assumes it will exercise options through the latest option date of that shopping center's anchor tenant lease.

(j)

Earnings per Share and Unit

Basic earnings per share of common stock and unit are computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares and units, respectively, outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share and unit reflect the conversion of obligations and the assumed exercises of securities including the effects of shares issuable under the Company's share-based payment arrangements, if dilutive.  Dividends paid on the Company's share-based compensation awards are not participating securities as they are forfeitable.

(

)

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants stock-based compensation to its employees and directors.  The Company recognizes the cost of stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the award, which is expensed over the vesting period.

When the Parent Company issues common stock as compensation, it receives a like number of common units from the Operating Partnership.  The Company is committed to contributing to the Operating Partnership all proceeds from the share-based awards granted under the Parent Company's Long-Term Omnibus Plan (the “Plan”).  Accordingly, the Parent Company's ownership in the Operating Partnership will increase based on the amount of proceeds contributed to the Operating Partnership for the common units it receives.  As a result of the issuance of common units to the Parent Company for stock-based compensation, the Operating Partnership records the effect of stock-based compensation for awards of equity in the Parent Company.

Segment Reporting

The Company's business is investing in retail shopping centers through direct ownership or partnership interests.  The Company actively manages its portfolio of retail shopping centers and may from time to time make decisions to sell lower performing properties or developments not meeting its long-term investment objectives.  The proceeds from sales are generally reinvested into higher quality retail shopping centers, through acquisitions, new developments, or redevelopment of existing centers, which management believes will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns.  It is management's intent that all retail shopping centers will be owned or developed for investment purposes; however, the  Company may decide to

sell all or a portion of a development upon completion.  The Company's revenues and net income are generated from the operation of its investment portfolio.  The Company also earns fees for services provided to manage and lease retail shopping centers owned through joint ventures.

The Company's portfolio is located throughout the United States.  Management does not distinguish or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of allocating resources or capital.  The Company reviews operating and financial data

for each property on an individual basis; therefore, the Company defines an operating segment as its individual properties.

The individual properties have been aggregated into one reportable segment based upon their similarities with regard to both the nature and economics of the centers, tenants and operational processes, as well as long-term average financial performance.

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.  Therefore, a fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.

•

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

•

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the Company's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.

The Company also remeasures nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new basis event, at fair value in subsequent periods if a remeasurement event occurs.

Codification Improvements

Topic 842 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets.  It also makes targeted changes to lessor accounting.

The provisions of these ASUs were effective as of January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  Topic 842 provides a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief or an additional transition method, allowing for initial application at the date of adoption and a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings.

See the updated Leases accounting policy disclosed in Note 1 and the added Leases disclosures in Note 7.

January 2019

The Company has completed its evaluation and adoption of this standard, as discussed in Note 1.  The Company utilized the alternative modified retrospective transition method provided in ASU 2018-11 (the “effective date method”), under which the effective date of January 1, 2019, is also the date of initial application.

See the updated Leases accounting policy disclosed in Note 1 and the added disclosures in Note 7, Leases.

Beyond the policy, presentation and disclosure changes discussed, the following changes had direct impact to Net Income from the adoptions of Topic 842:

Capitalization of indirect internal non-contingent lease costs and legal leasing costs are no longer permitted upon the adoption of this standard, which is resulting in an increase to Total operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Previous capitalization of internal leasing costs was $

6.5

million and $

10.4

million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Previous capitalization of internal legal costs was $

As the Company identifies properties (“reporting units”) that no longer meet its investment criteria, it will evaluate the property for potential sale.  A decision to sell a reporting unit results in the need to evaluate its goodwill for recoverability and may result in impairment.  Additionally, other changes impacting a reporting unit may be considered a triggering event.  If events occur that trigger an impairment evaluation at multiple reporting units, a goodwill impairment may be significant.

Leases

Lessor Accounting

The Company's Lease income is comprised of both fixed and variable income, as follows:

Fixed and in-substance fixed lease income includes stated amounts per the lease contract, which are primarily related to base rent, and in some cases stated amounts for CAM, real estate taxes, and insurance. Income for these amounts is recognized on a straight- line basis.

Variable lease income includes the following two main items in the lease contracts:

(i)

Recoveries from tenants represents amounts which tenants are contractually obligated to reimburse the Company for the tenants’ portion of actual Recoverable Costs incurred.  Generally the Company’s leases provide for the tenants to reimburse the Company based on the tenants’ share of the actual costs incurred in proportion to the tenants’ share of leased space in the property.

(ii)

Percentage rent represents amounts billable to tenants based on the tenants' actual sales volume in excess of levels specified in the lease contract.

The following table provides a disaggregation of lease income recognized under ASC Topic 842,

Leases

, as either fixed or variable lease income based on the criteria specified in ASC 842:

Future minimum rents under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding variable lease payments, are as follows:

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with certain of its subsidiaries treated as taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) entities, which are subject to federal and state income taxes.

The following table summarizes the tax status of dividends paid on our common shares:

Our consolidated expense (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was as follows:

(1)

Includes $

, $

706,000

and $

The TRS entities are subject to federal and state income taxes and file separate tax returns.  Income tax expense (benefit) differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to pretax income of the TRS entities, as follows:

(1)

Includes $

757,000

, $

706,000

, and $

90,000

of tax expense presented within Other operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.  Additionally, $

488,000

and ($

184,000

) of tax expense (benefit) is presented within Gain on sale of real estate (or Provision for impairment), net of tax, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The tax effects of temporary differences (included in Accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets) are summarized as follows:

The net deferred tax liability decreased during 2019 primarily due to the depreciation of property at TRS entities.  Also, during 2019, the Company converted one of its TRS entities to a REIT which resulted in the reversal of that entities’ deferred tax assets, liabilities, and valuation allowance.  The Company believes it is more likely than not that a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets, which primarily consist of net operating losses and deferred interest expense, will not be realized unless tax planning strategies are implemented.

Notes Payable and Unsecured Credit Facilities

The Company’s outstanding debt consists of the following:

(1)

Includes six mortgages, whose interest varies on LIBOR based formulas.  Four of these variable rate loans have interest rate swaps in place to fix the interest rates at a range of

2.5

% to

4.1

%.  The weighted average contractual and effective rates above are based on the rates with the interest rate swaps.

(2)

Maturity is subject to two six month extensions at the Company's option.  The weighted average contractual and effective interest rates for the Line are calculated based on a fully drawn Line balance.

Notes Payable

Notes payable consist of mortgage loans secured by properties and unsecured public and private debt.  Mortgage loans may be prepaid, but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums, and are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest or interest only.  Unsecured public debt may be prepaid subject to accrued and unpaid interest through the proposed redemption date and a make-whole premium. Interest on unsecured public and private debt is payable semi-annually.

The Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants for its unsecured public debt as defined in the indenture agreements such as the following ratios: Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Assets, Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated Assets, Consolidated Income for Debt Service to Consolidated Debt Service, and Unencumbered Consolidated Assets to Unsecured Consolidated Debt.  As of December 31, 2019, management of the Company believes it is in compliance with all financial covenants for its unsecured public debt.

Unsecured Credit Facilities

The Company has an unsecured line of credit commitment (the “Line”) and an unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan”) under separate credit agreements with a syndicate of banks.

The Line has a borrowing capacity of $

1.25

billion, which is reduced by the balance of outstanding borrowings and commitments under outstanding letters of credit.  The Line bears interest at a variable rate of

LIBOR plus

0.875

%

and is subject to a commitment fee of

0.15

%, both of which are based on the Company's corporate credit rating.

The Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate based on

LIBOR plus

0.95

%

and has an interest rate swap in place to fix the interest rate at

2.0

%, as discussed further in note 10.

The Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants as defined in the Line and Term Loan credit agreements, such as Ratio of Indebtedness to Total Asset Value (“TAV”), Ratio of Unsecured Indebtedness to Unencumbered Asset Value, Ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges, Ratio of Secured Indebtedness to TAV, Ratio of Unencumbered Net Operating Income to Unsecured Interest Expense, and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing.  As of December 31, 2019, management of the Company believes it is in compliance with all financial covenants for the Line and Term Loans.

Includes unsecured public and private debt and unsecured credit facilities.

The Company has $

39.1

million of debt maturing over the next twelve months, which is in the form of non-recourse mortgage loans. The Company currently intends to repay the maturing balances and leave the properties unencumbered.  The Company has sufficient capacity on its Line to repay the maturing debt, if necessary.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The following table summarizes the terms and fair values of the Company's derivative financial instruments, as well as their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

(1)

Derivatives in an asset position are included within Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, while those in a liability position are included within Accounts payable and other liabilities.

(2)

On March 7, 2019, the Company settled its 30 year Treasury rate lock in connection with its issuance of the $


million

4.65

% unsecured notes due

March 2049

for $

5.7

million, which is included in the balance of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and will be amortized and reclassified to earnings over the


year term of the hedged transaction.

(3)

On August 14, 2019, the Company paid an interest rate swap breakage fee of approximately $

1.1

million to settle its interest rate swap in connection with the repayment in full of its $


million term loan that was due to mature in

December 2020

.  This breakage fee is included in Early extinguishment of debt in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

These derivative financial instruments are all interest rate swaps, which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.  The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and, as of December 31, 2019, does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.  The Company has master netting agreements; however, the Company does not have multiple derivatives subject to a single master netting agreement with the same counterparties.  Therefore, none are offset in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (

“

AOCI

”

) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

The following table represents the effect of the derivative financial instruments on the accompanying consolidated financial statements:

As of December 31, 2019, the Company expects $

4.1

million of net deferred losses on derivative instruments in AOCI, including the Company's share from its Investments in real estate partnerships, to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months.  Included in the reclassification is $

4.3

million which is related to previously settled swaps on the Company's ten and thirty year fixed rate unsecured debt.


.

Fair Value Measurements

(a)

Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments

All financial instruments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts which, in management's estimation, reasonably approximates their fair values, except for the following:

The above fair values represent management's estimate of the amounts that would be received from selling those assets or that would be paid to transfer those liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.  These fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs.  However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The Company develops its judgments based on the best information available at the measurement date, including expected cash flows, appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates, and available observable and unobservable inputs.  Service providers involved in fair value measurements are evaluated for competency and qualifications on an ongoing basis.  As considerable judgment is often necessary to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments, the fair values presented above are not necessarily indicative of amounts that will be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.

(b)

Fair Value Measurements

The following financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Securities

The Company has investments in marketable securities that are included within Other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value of the securities was determined using quoted prices in active markets, which are considered Level 1 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Changes in the value of securities are recorded within Net investment (income) loss in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, and includes unrealized (gains) losses of ($

3.8

) million, $

3.3

million, and ($

1.1

) million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

Available-for-Sale Debt Securities

Available-for-sale debt securities consist of investments in certificates of deposit and corporate bonds, and are recorded at fair value using matrix pricing methods to estimate fair value, which are considered Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Unrealized gains or losses on these debt securities are recognized through other comprehensive income.

Interest Rate Derivatives

The fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.  The Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its interest rate swaps.  As a result, the Company determined that its interest rate swaps valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The following table presents the placement in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $

50.5

million Provision for impairment on two operating properties which are classified as held and used.  One property was remeasured to fair value based on its expected selling price, which is reflected in the above Level 2 category, and resulted in a $

10.2

million Provision for impairment.  The second property impairment was triggered as a result of an expected early move out of a tenant at a single-tenant retail center that has declared bankruptcy, resulting in the Company re-evaluating the highest and best use of the asset and its expected hold period.  The fair value of the property was derived using a discounted cash flow model, which included assumptions around redevelopment of the asset to its highest and best use as a mixed-use project and re-leasing the space.  The discount rate of

8.58

% and terminal capitalization rate of

4.75

% used in the discounted cash flow model are considered significant inputs and assumptions to estimating the non-recurring fair value measurement of $

43.0

million, which is considered a Level 3 input per the fair value hierarchy.  The amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair value resulted in a $

40.3

million Provision for impairment.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a $

38.4

million provision for impairment, net of tax, which included $

31.8

million on real estate sold or held and used and $

6.6

million on three properties classified as held for sale.  The impairment of the real estate assets was determined based on the expected selling price as compared to the Company's carrying value of its investment.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recorded stock-based compensation in General and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, the components of which are further described below:

(1)

Includes amortization of the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards over the respective vesting periods.

(2)

Includes compensation expense specifically identifiable to development and redevelopment activities.  During 2018 and 2017, these amounts also include compensation expense specifically identifiable to leasing activities, as non-contingent internal leasing costs were capitalizable prior to the adoption of Topic 842,

Leases

, on January 1, 2019.

The Company established its Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) under which the Board of Directors may grant stock options and other stock-based awards to officers, directors, and other key employees.  The Plan allows the Company to issue up to

5.6

million shares in the form of the Parent Company's common stock or stock options.  As of December 31, 2019, there were

5.0

million shares available for grant under the Plan either through stock options or restricted stock awards.

Restricted Stock Awards

The Company grants restricted stock under the Plan to its employees as a form of long-term compensation and retention.  The terms of each restricted stock grant vary depending upon the participant's responsibilities and position within the Company.  The Company's stock grants can be categorized as either time-based awards, performance-based awards, or market-based awards.  All awards are valued at fair value, earn dividends throughout the vesting period, and have no voting rights.  Fair value is measured using the grant date market price for all time-based or performance-based awards.  Market based awards are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value based on the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the projected stock price at the time of payout, discounted to the valuation date over a three year performance period.  Assumptions include historic volatility over the previous three year period, risk-free interest rates, and Regency's historic daily return as compared to the market index.  Since the award payout includes dividend equivalents and the total shareholder return includes the value of dividends, no dividend yield assumption is required for the valuation.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

Compensation expense is measured at the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period for the entire award.

The following table summarizes non-vested restricted stock activity:

(1)

Time-based awards vest beginning on the first anniversary following the grant date over a one or four year service period

.  These grants are subject only to continued employment and are not dependent on future performance measures.  Accordingly, if such vesting criteria are not met, compensation cost previously recognized would be reversed.

(2)

Performance-based awards are earned subject to future performance measurements.  Once the performance criteria are achieved and the actual number of shares earned is determined, shares vest over a required service period.  The Company considers the likelihood of meeting the performance criteria based upon management's estimates from which it determines the amounts recognized as expense on a periodic basis.

(3)

Market-based awards are earned dependent upon the Company's total shareholder return in relation to the shareholder return of a NAREIT index over a three-year period.  Once the performance criteria are met and the actual number of shares earned is determined, the shares are immediately vested and distributed.  The probability of meeting the criteria is considered when calculating the estimated fair value on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation.  These awards are accounted for as awards with market criteria, with compensation cost recognized over the service period, regardless of whether the performance criteria are achieved and the awards are ultimately earned.  The significant assumptions underlying determination of fair values for market-based awards granted were as follows:

Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

The Company is involved in litigation on a number of matters and is subject to certain claims, which arise in the normal course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.  Legal fees are expensed as incurred.

Environmental

The Company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations pertaining primarily to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks.

The Company can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to the shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental contaminants or liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to it, that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties, or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional material environmental liability to the Company.

Letters of Credit

The Company has the right to issue letters of credit under the Line up to an amount not to exceed $

50.0

million, which reduces the credit availability under the Line.  These letters of credit are primarily issued as collateral on behalf of its captive insurance program and to facilitate the construction of development projects.  As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had $

12.5

million and $

9.4

million, respectively, in letters of credit outstanding.

Purchase Commitments

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Parent Company's management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the Parent Company conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  Based on this evaluation, the Parent Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms.  These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Parent Company in the reports it files or submits is accumulated and communicated to management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Parent Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).  Under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the Parent Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on its evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

, the Parent Company's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued a report, included herein, on the effectiveness of the Parent Company's internal control over financial reporting.

The Parent Company's system of internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Controls

There have been no changes in the Parent Company's internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with this evaluation that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
