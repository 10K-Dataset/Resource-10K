Forward-Looking Statements

In addition to historical information, the following information contains forward-looking statements as defined under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements include statements about anticipated growth in revenues, the
size of our development program, earnings per share, returns and portfolio value and expectations about our liquidity. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which Regency
Centers Corporation (“Regency” or “Company”) operates, and management’s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain known and unknown risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in national and local economic conditions including the
impact of a slowing economy; financial difficulties of tenants; competitive market conditions, including pricing of acquisitions and sales of properties and out-parcels; changes in expected leasing activity and market rents; timing of acquisitions,
development starts and sales of properties and out-parcels; meeting development schedules; our inability to exercise voting control over the co-investment partnerships through which we own or develop many of our properties; weather; consequences of
any armed conflict or terrorist attack against the United States; and the ability to obtain governmental approvals. For additional information, see “Risk Factors” elsewhere herein. The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto of Regency Centers Corporation appearing elsewhere within.

PART I

Item 1. Business

Regency is a qualified real estate investment trust (“REIT”), which began operations in
1993. Our primary operating and investment goal is long-term growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return, which we work to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning, operating and developing high-quality community and neighborhood
shopping centers that are tenanted by market-dominant grocers, category-leading anchors, specialty retailers, and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities. All of our operating, investing and
financing activities are performed through our operating partnership, Regency Centers, L.P. (“RCLP”), RCLP’s wholly owned subsidiaries, and through its investments in co-investment partnerships with third party investors. Regency
currently owns 99% of the outstanding operating partnership units of RCLP.

At December 31, 2007, we directly owned 232 shopping centers (the
“Consolidated Properties”) located in 23 states representing 25.7 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”). Our cost of these shopping centers is $4.0 billion before depreciation. Through co-investment
partnerships, we own partial interests in 219 shopping centers (the “Unconsolidated Properties”) located in 27 states and the District of Columbia representing 25.4 million square feet of GLA. Our investment in the partnerships that
own the Unconsolidated Properties is $432.9 million. Certain portfolio information described below is presented (a) on a Combined Basis, which is a total of the Consolidated Properties and the Unconsolidated Properties, (b) for our
Consolidated Properties only and (c) for the Unconsolidated Properties that we own through co-investment partnerships. We believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that
we wholly-own versus those that we partially-own, but for which we provide asset management, property management, leasing, investing and financing services. The shopping center portfolio that we manage, on a Combined Basis, represents 451 shopping
centers located in 29 states and the District of Columbia and contains 51.1 million square feet of GLA.

We earn revenues and generate cash flow
by leasing space in our shopping centers to market-leading grocers, major retail anchors, specialty side-shop retailers, and restaurants, including ground leasing or selling building pads (out-parcels) to these tenants. We experience growth in
revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers, and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers. Community and neighborhood shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering
necessities and services. This high traffic generates increased sales, thereby driving higher occupancy and rental-rate growth, which we expect will sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term.



Index to Financial Statements

We seek a range of strong national, regional and local specialty retailers, for the same reason that we choose to
anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs. We have created a formal partnering process—the Premier Customer Initiative (“PCI”)—to promote mutually
beneficial relationships with our specialty retailers. The objective of PCI is for Regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the “best-in-class” operators in their respective merchandising categories. Such retailers
reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center’s anchor, help to stabilize a center’s occupancy, reduce re-leasing downtime, reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents.

We grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development, where we acquire the land and construct the
building. Development is customer driven, meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction. Developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers, resulting in modern shopping centers with
long-term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital. This development process generally requires three to four years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction, lease-up and stabilization of
rental income, but can take longer depending upon the size of the project. Generally, anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center, resulting in rental income during the development phase.

We intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth programs, which should preserve our investment-grade ratings. Our approach
is founded on our self-funding business model. This model utilizes center “recycling” as a key component, which requires ongoing monitoring of each center to ensure that it continues to meet our investment standards. We sell the operating
properties that no longer measure up to our standards. We also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive profit margins with the intent of selling them to co-investment partnerships or other third parties upon completion. These sale
proceeds are re-deployed into new, higher-quality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns.

Joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new developments and acquisitions, as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services. As asset manager, we are
engaged by our partners to apply similar operating, investment, and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the co-investment partnerships. Co-investment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third
parties or direct purchases from Regency. Although selling properties to co-investment partnerships reduces our ownership interest, we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our high quality standards and long-term
investment strategy.

Competition

We are among the largest
publicly-held owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues, number of properties, gross leasable area and market capitalization. There are numerous companies and private individuals engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition
and operation of shopping centers which compete with us in our targeted markets. This results in competition for attracting anchor tenants, as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites. We believe that the
principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location, demographics, rental costs, tenant mix, property age and maintenance. We believe that our competitive advantages include our locations within our market areas, the
design quality of our shopping centers, the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers, our relationships with our anchor tenants and our side-shop and out-parcel retailers, our PCI program which allows us to provide retailers with
multiple locations, our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers, and our ability to source and develop new shopping centers.

Changes in
Policies

Our Board of Directors establishes the policies that govern our investment and operating strategies including, among others, development
and acquisition of shopping centers, tenant and market focus, debt and equity financing policies, quarterly distributions to stockholders, and REIT tax status. The Board of Directors may amend these policies at any time without a vote of our
stockholders.

Employees

Our
headquarters are located at One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida. We presently maintain 21 market offices nationwide where we conduct management, leasing, construction, and investment activities. At December 31, 2007, we had
568 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Compliance with Governmental Regulations

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances
at our shopping centers. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of required remediation and the owner's liability for
remediation could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent the property or
borrow using the property as collateral. We have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation. Environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial
effect on us due to reserves for remediation, insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation and various state-regulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state.

Executive Officers

The executive officers of the Company are appointed
each year by the Board of Directors. Each of the executive officers has been employed by the Company in the position or positions indicated in the list and pertinent notes below. Each of the executive officers has been employed by the Company for
more than five years.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Risk Factors Related to Our Industry and Real Estate Investments

Our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by poor market conditions where properties are geographically concentrated.

Regency’s performance depends on the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated. During the year ended December 31, 2007, our
properties in California, Florida and Texas accounted for 58.4% of our consolidated net operating income. Our revenues and cash available for distribution to stockholders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market
conditions in these areas, such as an oversupply of retail space or a reduction in the demand for shopping centers, become more competitive relative to other geographic areas.

Loss of revenues from major tenants could reduce distributions to stockholders.

We derive significant revenues from
anchor tenants such as Kroger, Publix and Safeway that occupy more than one center. Distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a major tenant:

•

becomes bankrupt or insolvent;

•

experiences a downturn in its business;

•

materially defaults on its leases;

•

does not renew its leases as they expire; or

•

renews at lower rental rates.

Vacated anchor space,
including space owned by the anchor, can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant’s customer drawing power. Most anchors have the right to vacate and prevent re-tenanting by
paying rent for the balance of the lease term. If major tenants vacate a property, then other tenants may be entitled to terminate their leases at the property.

Downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow.

Our properties consist
primarily of grocery-anchored shopping centers. Our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. The market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by any of the following:

•

weakness in the national, regional and local economies, which could adversely impact consumer spending and retail sales and in turn tenant demand for space;

•

the growth of super-centers, such as those operated by Wal-Mart, and their adverse effect on major grocery chains;

•

the impact of increased energy costs on consumers and its consequential effect on the number of shopping visits to our centers;

•

consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States;

•

the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies;

•

the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector;

•

the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets;



Index to Financial Statements

•

increasing consumer purchases through catalogs or the Internet;

•

reduction in the demand by tenants to occupy our shopping centers as a result of reduced consumer demand for certain retail formats such as video rental stores;

•

the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

•

changes in taxation and zoning laws; and

•

adverse government regulation.

To the extent that any
of these conditions occur, they are likely to impact market rents for retail space, occupancy in the operating portfolios, our ability to recycle capital, and our cash available for distribution to stockholders.

Unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could reduce distributions to stockholders.

We actively pursue development activities as opportunities arise. Development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements which can
significantly delay the development process. We may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received. We incur other risks associated with development activities, including:

•

the ability to lease up developments to full occupancy on a timely basis;

•

the risk that occupancy rates and rents of a completed project will not be sufficient to make the project profitable and available for contribution to our co-investment
partnerships or sale to third parties.

•

the risk that the current size and continued growth in our development pipeline will strain the organization's capacity to complete the developments within the targeted
timelines and at the expected returns on invested capital;

•

the risk that we may abandon development opportunities and lose our investment in these developments;

•

the risk that development costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project unprofitable;

•

delays in the development and construction process;

•

lack of cash flow during the construction period; and

If developments are unsuccessful, funding provided from contributions to co-investment partnerships and sales to third parties may be materially reduced and our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders will be reduced. Our
earnings and cash flow available for distribution to stockholders also may be reduced if we experience a significant slowdown in our development activities.

Uninsured loss may adversely affect distributions to stockholders.

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage,
rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. We believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate in accordance with industry
standards. There are, however, some types of losses, such as from hurricanes, terrorism, wars or earthquakes, which may be uninsurable, or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically justifiable. If an uninsured loss occurs, we
could lose both the invested capital in and anticipated revenues from the property, but we would still be obligated to repay any recourse mortgage debt on the property. In that event, our distributions to stockholders could be reduced.

We face competition from numerous sources.

The ownership of shopping
centers is highly fragmented, with less than 10% owned by real estate investment trusts. We face competition from other real estate investment trusts as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition, ownership and leasing of shopping
centers. We compete to develop shopping centers with other real estate investment trusts engaged in development activities as well as with local, regional and national real estate developers.



Index to Financial Statements

We compete in the acquisition of properties through proprietary research that identifies opportunities in markets
with high barriers to entry and higher-than-average population growth and household income. We seek to maximize rents per square foot by (1) establishing relationships with supermarket chains that are first or second in their markets or other
category-leading anchors and (2) leasing non-anchor space in multiple centers to national or regional tenants. We compete to develop properties by applying our proprietary research methods to identify development and leasing opportunities and
by pre-leasing a significant portion of a center before beginning construction.

There can be no assurance, however, that other real estate owners or
developers will not utilize similar research methods and target the same markets and anchor tenants that we target. These entities may successfully control these markets and tenants to our exclusion. If we cannot successfully compete in our targeted
markets, our cash flow, and therefore distributions to stockholders, may be adversely affected.

Costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow
available for distribution to stockholders.

Under various federal, state and local laws, an owner or manager of real property may be liable for
the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of
any required remediation could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner.

We are subject to numerous environmental
laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks (UST’s). The presence of, or the
failure to properly remediate, hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a contaminated property or to borrow using the property as collateral. Any of these developments could reduce cash flow and distributions
to stockholders.

Risk Factors Related to Our Co-investment Partnerships and Acquisition Structure

We do not have voting control over our joint venture investments, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued.

We have invested as a co-venturer in the acquisition or development of properties. As of December 31, 2007, our investments in real estate partnerships
represented 10.4% of our total assets. These investments involve risks not present in a wholly-owned project. We do not have voting control over the ventures. The co-venturer might (1) have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our
interests or goals or (2) otherwise impede our objectives. The co-venturer also might become insolvent or bankrupt.

Our co-investment partnerships account
for a significant portion of our revenues and net income in the form of management fees and are an important part of our growth strategy. The termination of our co-investment partnerships could adversely affect distributions to stockholders.

Our management fee income has increased significantly as our participation in co-investment partnerships has increased. If co-investment partnerships
owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason, we would lose the asset management and property management fees from these co-investment partnerships, which could adversely affect our ability to recycle capital and fund
developments and acquisitions and the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders.

In addition, termination of the co-investment
partnerships without replacing them with new co-investment partnerships could adversely affect our growth strategy. Property sales to the co-investment partnerships provide us with an important source of funding for additional developments and
acquisitions. Without this source of capital, our ability to recycle capital, fund developments and acquisitions and to increase distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected.



Index to Financial Statements

Our partnership structure may limit our flexibility to manage our assets.

We invest in retail shopping centers through Regency Centers, L.P., the operating partnership in which we currently own 99% of the outstanding common partnership
units. From time to time, we acquire properties through our operating partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests. This acquisition structure may permit limited partners who contribute properties to us to defer some, if not all, of the
income tax liability that they would incur if they sold the property for cash.

Properties contributed to our operating partnership may have
unrealized gain attributable to the difference between the fair market value and adjusted tax basis in the properties prior to contribution. As a result, our sale of these properties could cause adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who
contributed them.

Generally, our operating partnership has no obligation to consider the tax consequences of its actions to any limited partner.
However, our operating partnership may acquire properties in the future subject to material restrictions on refinancing or resale designed to minimize the adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contribute those properties. These
restrictions could significantly reduce our flexibility to manage our assets by preventing us from reducing mortgage debt or selling a property when such a transaction might be in our best interest in order to reduce interest costs or dispose of an
under-performing property.

Risk Factors Related to Our Capital Recycling and Capital Structure

A reduction in the availability of capital, an increase in the cost of capital, and higher market capitalization rates could adversely impact Regency’s ability to recycle
capital and fund developments and acquisitions, and could dilute earnings.

As part of our capital recycling program, we sell operating properties
that no longer meet our investment standards. We also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive margins with the intent of selling them to co-investment partnerships or other third parties for a profit. These sale proceeds are used
to fund the construction of new developments. An increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale, which would have an adverse impact on our capital recycling program by reducing the amount
of cash generated and profits realized. In order to meet the cash requirements of our development program, we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned, which would have a dilutive impact on our earnings.

Our debt financing may reduce distributions to stockholders.

We do not
expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments when due on our debt. If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we might be forced (1) to dispose of properties, which might result in
losses, or (2) to obtain financing at unfavorable terms. Either could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stockholders.

In
addition, if we cannot make required mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage, causing the loss of cash flow from that property. Furthermore, substantially all of our debt is cross-defaulted, which means
that a default under one loan could trigger defaults under other loans.

Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that may be
incurred. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including the following:

•

leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to repay indebtedness or for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development
or other general corporate purposes;

•

leverage could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and

•

as a result, our leverage could lead to reduced distributions to stockholders.

Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition.

Our revolving
line of credit and our unsecured notes contain customary covenants, including compliance with financial ratios, such as ratios of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratios. Our line of credit also



Index to Financial Statements

restricts our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control. These covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition
activities. Moreover, if we breach any of these covenants, the resulting default could cause the acceleration of our indebtedness, even in the absence of a payment default. If we are not able to refinance our indebtedness after a default, or unable
to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, distributions to stockholders and our financial condition would be adversely affected.

We depend on external
sources of capital, which may not be available in the future.

To qualify as a REIT, we must, among other things, distribute to our stockholders
each year at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding any net capital gains). Because of these distribution requirements, we likely will not be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital for acquisitions or developments, with
income from operations. We therefore will have to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things, including the
market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings. In addition, our line of credit imposes covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing, such as a prohibition on negative pledge
agreements.

Additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders’ interests, and additional debt financing may
substantially increase our degree of leverage.

Risk Factors Related to Interest Rates and the Market for Our Stock

Increased interest rates may reduce distributions to stockholders.

We are
obligated on floating rate debt, and if we do not eliminate our exposure to increases in interest rates through interest rate protection or cap agreements, these increases may reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stockholders.

Although swap agreements enable us to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and cap agreements enable us to cap our maximum interest rate,
they expose us to the risk that the counterparties to these hedge agreements may not perform, which could increase our exposure to rising interest rates. If we enter into swap agreements, decreases in interest rates will increase our interest
expense as compared to the underlying floating rate debt. This could result in our making payments to unwind these agreements, such as in connection with a prepayment of the floating rate debt. Cap agreements do not protect us from increases up to
the capped rate.

Increased market interest rates could reduce our stock prices.

The annual dividend rate on our common stock as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of our stock. An increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers to demand a higher annual dividend rate,
which could adversely affect the market price of our stock. A decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets. Selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a
dilutive impact on existing shareholders.

Risk Factors Related to Federal Income Tax Laws

If we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.

We believe that we qualify for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for
taxation as a REIT. If we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. The
determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances, some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at
least 95% of our gross income must come from specific passive



Index to Financial Statements

sources, like rent, that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in
interpreting the REIT requirements. We also are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding capital gains). The fact that we hold many of our assets through co-investment partnerships and their
subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, Congress and the Internal Revenue Service might make changes to the tax laws and
regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings, that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a REIT.

Also, unless
the IRS granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year we first failed to qualify. If we failed to qualify as a REIT, we would have to pay significant income taxes. This
would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities. In addition, we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders.

Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to pay certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. For example, if we have net income from “prohibited
transactions,” that income will be subject to a 100% tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. The determination as to whether a
particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale. While we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years, we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited
transactions, but there can be no assurance that the IRS would not contend otherwise.

In addition, any net taxable income earned directly by our
taxable affiliates, including Regency Realty Group, Inc., is subject to federal and state corporate income tax. Several provisions of the laws applicable to REITs and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable REIT subsidiary will be subject to an
appropriate level of federal income taxation. For example, a taxable REIT subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated REIT. In addition, a REIT has to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that it
receives if the economic arrangements between the REIT, the REIT’s tenants and the taxable REIT subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties. Finally, some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our
income even though as a REIT we are not subject to federal income tax on that income. To the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal, state and local taxes, we will have less cash available for distributions to our
stockholders.

A REIT may not own securities in any one issuer if the value of those securities exceeds 5% of the value of the REIT’s total
assets or the securities owned by the REIT represent more than 10% of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities or 10% of the value of the issuer’s outstanding securities. An exception to these tests allows a REIT to own securities of a
subsidiary that exceed the 5% value test and the 10% value tests if the subsidiary elects to be a “taxable REIT subsidiary.” We are not able to own securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 20% of
the value of our total assets. We currently own more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of Regency Realty Group, Inc., which has elected to be a taxable REIT subsidiary.

Risk Factors Related to Our Ownership Limitations, the Florida Business Corporation Act and Certain Other Matters

Restrictions on the ownership of our capital stock to preserve our REIT status could delay or prevent a change in control.

Ownership of more than 7% by value of our outstanding capital stock by certain persons is restricted for the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a REIT,
with certain exceptions. This 7% limitation may discourage a change in control and may also (i) deter tender offers for our capital stock, which offers may be attractive to our stockholders, or (ii) limit the opportunity for our

PART II

Item 5. Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “REG”. We currently have approximately 26,000 stockholders. The following table sets forth the high and low prices and the cash
dividends declared on our common stock by quarter for 2007 and 2006.

We intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to our common stockholders. Future distributions will be
declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon cash generated by operating activities, our financial condition, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deem relevant. Distributions by us to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes will be taxable to stockholders
as either ordinary dividend income or capital gain income if so declared by us. Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital. Such distributions have the effect of deferring taxation
until the sale of a stockholder’s common stock. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income. Under certain circumstances, which we do not expect to
occur, we could be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distributions in order to meet such requirements. We currently maintain the Regency Centers Corporation Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan which enables our
stockholders to automatically reinvest distributions, as well as make voluntary cash payments towards the purchase of additional shares.

Under the
loan agreement of our line of credit, in the event of any monetary default, we may not make distributions to stockholders except to the extent necessary to maintain our REIT status.

We sold the following equity securities during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 that we did not report on Form 8-K because they represent in the aggregate
less than 1% of our outstanding common stock. All shares were issued to one accredited investor, an unrelated party, in a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, in exchange for an equal
number of common units of our operating partnership, Regency Centers, L.P.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview and Operating
Philosophy

Regency is a qualified real estate investment trust (“REIT”), which began operations in 1993. Our primary operating and
investment goal is long-term growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return, which we work to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning, operating and developing high-quality community and neighborhood shopping centers that are tenanted
by market-dominant grocers, category-leading anchors, specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities. All of our operating, investing and financing activities are performed through
our operating partnership, Regency Centers, L.P. (“RCLP”), RCLP’s wholly owned subsidiaries, and through its investments in co-investment partnerships with third parties. Regency currently owns 99% of the outstanding operating
partnership units of RCLP.



Index to Financial Statements

At December 31, 2007, we directly owned 232 shopping centers (the “Consolidated Properties”) located
in 23 states representing 25.7 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”). Our cost of these shopping centers is $4.0 billion before depreciation. Through co-investment partnerships, we own partial interests in 219 shopping
centers (the “Unconsolidated Properties”) located in 27 states and the District of Columbia representing 25.4 million square feet of GLA. Our investment in the partnerships that own the Unconsolidated Properties is $432.9 million.
Certain portfolio information described below is presented (a) on a Combined Basis, which is a total of the Consolidated Properties and the Unconsolidated Properties, (b) for our Consolidated Properties only and (c) for the
Unconsolidated Properties that we own through co-investment partnerships. We believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we wholly-own versus those that we partially-own,
but for which we provide asset management, property management, leasing, investing and financing services. The shopping center portfolio that we manage, on a Combined Basis, represents 451 shopping centers located in 29 states and the District of
Columbia and contains 51.1 million square feet of GLA.

We earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to
market-leading grocers, major retail anchors, specialty side-shop retailers, and restaurants, including ground leasing or selling building pads (out-parcels) to these potential tenants. We experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and
rental rates at currently owned shopping centers, and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers. Community and neighborhood shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering daily necessities and services. This high
traffic generates increased sales, thereby driving higher occupancy and rental-rate growth, which we expect will sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term.

We seek a range of strong national, regional and local specialty retailers, for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major
retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs. We have created a formal partnering process—the Premier Customer Initiative (“PCI”)—to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our specialty
retailers. The objective of PCI is for Regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the “best-in-class” operators in their respective merchandising categories. Such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths
of a center’s anchor, help to stabilize a center’s occupancy, reduce re-leasing downtime, reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents.

We grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development, where we acquire the land and construct the building. Development is customer driven, meaning we generally
have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction. Developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers, resulting in modern shopping centers with long-term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our
invested capital. This development process generally requires three to four years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction, lease-up and stabilization of rental income, but can take longer depending upon the size of the
project. Generally, anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center, resulting in rental income during the development phase.

We intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth program, which should preserve our investment-grade ratings. Our approach is founded on
our self-funding business model. This model utilizes center “recycling” as a key component, which requires ongoing monitoring of each center to ensure that it continues to meet our investment standards. We sell the operating properties
that no longer measure up to our standards. We also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive profit margins with the intent of selling them to co-investment partnerships or other third parties upon completion. These sale proceeds
are re-deployed into new, higher-quality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns.

Joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new developments and acquisitions, as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services. As asset manager, we are engaged by our
partners to apply similar operating, investment, and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the co-investment partnerships. Co-investment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct
purchases from Regency. Although selling properties to co-investment partnerships reduces our ownership interest, we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our high quality standards and long-term investment strategy. We
currently have no obligations or liabilities of the co-investment partnerships beyond our economic ownership interest.



Index to Financial Statements

We have identified certain significant risks and challenges affecting our industry, and we are addressing them
accordingly. The current economic downturn could result in a decline in occupancy levels at our shopping centers, which would reduce our rental revenues. We believe that our investment focus on neighborhood and community shopping centers that
conveniently provide daily necessities should minimize the current economy’s negative impact to our shopping centers, although we may incur slower income growth and potentially no growth depending upon the severity of the economic downturn.
Increased competition and the slowing economy could result in higher than usual retailer store closings. We are closely monitoring the operating performance and tenants’ sales in our shopping centers including those tenants operating retail
formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition or business practice. We also continue to monitor retail trends and market our shopping centers based on consumer demand. In the current environment retailers are reducing their demand
for new stores. A significant slowdown in retailer new store demand could cause a corresponding reduction in our shopping center development program that would reduce our future rental revenues and profits from development sales. A significant
reduction in our development program including future developments being pursued could reduce our net income as a result of (i) potentially higher write-offs of pre-development costs on new development pursuits, (ii) lower capitalized
interest from not converting land currently owned and held for future development into an active development or stopping development of a current project, and (iii) reduced capitalized employee costs (See Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates—Capitalization of Costs described further below). Based upon our current pipeline of development projects undergoing due diligence, which is our best indication of retailer expansion plans, the presence of our development teams in key
markets in combination with their excellent relationships with leading anchor tenants, we remain cautiously optimistic about our development program. However, if economic growth stalls, our volume of new development activity may be less than that of
historical levels until the economy returns to its historical levels of growth.

Shopping Center Portfolio

The following tables summarize general operating statistics related to our shopping center portfolio, which we use to evaluate and monitor our performance.

We seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through diversification which we achieve by geographically
diversifying our shopping centers; avoiding dependence on any single property, market, or tenant, and owning a portion of our shopping centers through co-investment partnerships.



Index to Financial Statements

The following summarizes the four largest grocery tenants occupying our shopping centers at December 31, 2007:

(a)

For the Combined Properties including stores owned by grocery anchors that are attached to our centers.

(b)

GLA and annualized base rent include the Consolidated Properties plus Regency’s pro-rata share of the Unconsolidated Properties.

Although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy are given the right to cancel any or all of their leases and close
related stores, or to continue to operate. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. We continually
monitor industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties especially in light of the current downturn in the economy. We continue to monitor the video rental
industry while its operators transition to different rental formats including on-line rental programs. At December 31, 2007, we had leases with 123 video rental stores representing $8.9 million of annual rental income to the Consolidated
Properties and our pro-rata share of the Unconsolidated Properties.

In October 2007, Movie Gallery filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Movie
Gallery has closed six stores and has served notice of five additional store closings. The annual base rent on a pro-rata basis is approximately $860,000 or .24% associated with these eleven stores. Subsequent to these closings, we expect that Movie
Gallery will continue to operate 21 stores with annual base rent on a pro-rata basis of approximately $950,000 or .26%.

We are not aware at this
time of the current or pending bankruptcy of any other tenants that would cause a significant reduction in our revenues, and no tenant represents more than 6% of the total of our annual base rental revenues and our pro-rata share of the base
revenues of the Unconsolidated Properties.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We expect that cash generated from operating activities combined with gains on the sale of development properties will provide the necessary funds to pay our operating expenses, interest expense, scheduled principal payments on
outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our shopping centers, and dividends to stockholders. Net cash provided by operating activities was $224.3 million, $216.8 million, and $205.4 million, and gains from
the sale of real estate were $79.6 million, $124.8 million, and $76.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2007, 2006, and 2005, we incurred capital expenditures to improve our shopping centers of
$15.1 million, $14.0 million, and $14.4 million, we paid scheduled principal payments of $4.5 million, $4.5 million, and $5.5 million to our lenders on mortgage loans, and we paid dividends to our stockholders and unit holders of $204.3 million,
$185.2 million, and $167.4 million, respectively. The increase in dividends during 2007 relates to a 10.9% increase in our annual dividend per common share.

We intend to continue to grow our portfolio by investing in shopping centers through ground up development of new centers or acquisition of existing centers. Because development and acquisition activities are discretionary in nature, they
are not expected to burden the capital resources we have currently available for liquidity requirements. However, our development program continues to be a significant part of our business model and we expect to continue to start new development
projects each year based upon retailer store demand, capital availability, and adequate investment returns. We expect to meet our long-term capital investment requirements for development, acquisitions, and maturing secured mortgage loans primarily
from: (i) residual cash generated from operating activities after the payments described above, (ii) draws on our line of credit, and (iii) proceeds from the sale or joint venturing of real estate. We would expect that maturing
unsecured public debt would be repaid from the proceeds of similar new issues



Index to Financial Statements

in the future. Although we have no maturing public debt in 2008, we do have $50 million and $160 million maturing in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Although common or
preferred equity raised in the public markets is a funding option, and we consider our access to these markets to be good, we do not currently anticipate issuing equity to fund our development program or repay maturing debt. We would consider
issuing equity as part of a financing plan to maintain our leverage ratios at acceptable levels as determined by our Board of Directors. At December 31, 2007, we had an unlimited amount available under our shelf registration for equity
securities and RCLP had $200 million available for debt under its shelf registration.

The following table summarizes net cash flows related to
operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):

At December 31, 2007 we had 49 properties under construction or undergoing major renovations on a
Combined Basis, which when completed, will represent a net investment of $1.1 billion after projected sales of adjacent land and out-parcels. This compares to 47 properties that were under construction at the end of 2006 representing an investment
of $1.1 billion upon completion. We estimate that we will earn an average return on our investment from our current development projects of 8.39% on a fully allocated basis including direct internal costs and the cost to acquire any residual
interests held by minority development partners. Average returns have declined over previous years primarily the result of higher costs associated with the acquisition of land and construction. We believe that our development returns are sufficient
on a risk adjusted basis. Costs necessary to complete the current development projects, net of projected land sales, are estimated to be $447.4 million and will likely be expended through 2011. The costs to complete these developments will be funded
from our $600.0 million line of credit, which had $392.0 million of available funding at December 31, 2007, and from expected proceeds from the future sale of shopping centers as part of the capital recycling program described above.

During 2007, we acquired five shopping centers for a purchase price of $106.0 million, which included the assumption of $42.3 million in debt, net
of a $1.2 million discount. In accordance with Statement 141, acquired lease intangible assets and acquired lease intangible liabilities of $9.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively were recorded for these acquisitions. The acquisitions were
accounted for as a purchase business combination and the results of their operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships (Co-investment partnerships)

At December 31, 2007, we had investments in
unconsolidated real estate partnerships of $432.9 million. The following table is a summary of unconsolidated combined assets and liabilities of these co-investment partnerships and our pro-rata share (see note below) at December 31, 2007 and
2006 (dollars in thousands):

Pro-rata financial information is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. However, management believes that providing
such information is useful to investors in assessing the impact of its unconsolidated real estate partnership activities on the operations of Regency, which includes such items on a single line presentation under the equity method in its
consolidated financial statements.

We account for all investments in real estate partnerships in which we own 50% or less and do not
have a controlling financial interest using the equity method. We have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R)
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46(R)”) and do not require consolidation under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5 “Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group,
Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights” (“EITF 04-5”) or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (AICPA) Statement of Position 78-9, “Accounting for
Investments in Real Estate Ventures” (“SOP 78-9”), and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting. Major decisions, including property acquisitions not meeting pre-established investment
criteria, dispositions, financings, annual budgets and dissolution of the ventures are subject to the approval of all partners. Investments in real estate partnerships are primarily composed of co-investment partnerships where we invest with three
co-investment partners and an open-end real estate fund (“Regency Retail Partners” or the “Fund”), as further described below. In addition to earning our pro-rata share of net income or loss in each of these partnerships, we
receive fees for asset management, property management, leasing, investment and financing services. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we received fees from these co-investment partnerships of $32.3 million, $30.9 million, and $26.8 million, respectively.
Our investments in real estate partnerships as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 consist of the following (in thousands):

(1)

At December 31, 2006, our ownership interest in Regency Retail Partners was 26.8%.

We co-invest with the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund in three co-investment partnerships (collectively “Columbia”), in which we have ownership interests of 20% or 30%. As of December 31, 2007, Columbia
owned 28 shopping centers, had total assets of $648.2 million, and net income of $12.7 million for the year ended. Our share of Columbia’s total assets and net income was $142.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively which represents 3.4% of
our total assets and 1.4% of our net income available for common stockholders. During 2007, Columbia acquired eight shopping centers from unrelated parties for a purchase price of $88.7 million, net of $15.2 million of assumed debt and $31.1 million
in financing obtained by Columbia. We contributed $9.3 million to Columbia for our pro-rata share of the purchase price.

We co-invest with the
California State Teachers’ Retirement System (“CalSTRS”) in a joint venture (“RegCal”) in which we have a 25% ownership interest. As of December 31, 2007, RegCal owned eight shopping centers, had total assets of $167.3
million, and had net income of $2.8 million for the year ended. Our share of RegCal’s total assets and



Index to Financial Statements

net income was $41.8 million and $662,217, respectively which represents 1.0% of our total assets and less than 1.0% of our net income available for common
stockholders, respectively. During 2007, CalSTRS sold one shopping center to an unrelated party for $13.2 million for a gain of $1.4 million.

We
co-invest with Macquarie CountryWide Trust of Australia (“MCW”) in five co-investment partnerships, two in which we have an ownership interest of 25% (“MCWR I”), two in which we have an ownership interest of 24.95% (“MCWR
II), and one in which we have an ownership interest of 16.35% (“MCWR-DESCO”).

As of December 31, 2007, MCWR I owned 42 shopping
centers, had total assets of $612.0 million, and net income of $32.7 million for the year ended. Our share of MCWR I’s total assets and net income was $153.1 million and $10.3 million, respectively. During 2007, MCWR I sold nine shopping
centers for $137.4 million to unrelated parties for a gain of $22.6 million. During 2007 MCWR I acquired one shopping center from an unrelated party for a purchase price of $23.0 million, which included the assumption of $10.8 million of debt. We
contributed $2.2 million to MCWR I for our pro-rata share of the purchase price.

As of December 31, 2007, MCWR II owned 96 shopping centers,
had total assets of $2.6 billion and recorded a net loss of $13.1 million for the year ended. Our share of MCWR II’s total assets and net loss was $651.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively. As a result of the significant amount of
depreciation and amortization expense recorded by MCWR II in connection with the acquisition of the First Washington Portfolio in 2005, the joint venture may continue to report a net loss in future years, but is expected to produce positive cash
flow from operations. During 2007, MCWR II sold one shopping center to an unrelated party for $13.5 million for a gain of $560,169. We have the ability to receive an acquisition fee of approximately $5.2 million (the “Contingent Acquisition
Fee”) deferred from the original acquisition date of the First Washington Portfolio which is subject to achieving cumulative targeted income levels through 2008. The Contingent Acquisition Fee will only be recognized if earned, and the
recognition of income will be limited to that percentage of MCWR II, or 75.05%, of the joint venture not owned by us.

On August 10, 2007,
MCWR-DESCO closed on the acquisition of 32 retail centers for a purchase price of approximately $396.2 million including debt of approximately $209.5 million. We contributed $29.7 million to the venture for our pro-rata share of the purchase price
for our 16.35% equity ownership. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination by MCWR-DESCO. As of December 31, 2007, MCWR-DESCO had total assets of $419.9 million and recorded a net loss of $3.3 million since inception
primarily related to depreciation and amortization expense, but is expected to produce positive cash flow from operations. Our share of the venture’s total assets and net loss was $68.7 million and $465,028, respectively.

Our investment in the five co-investment partnerships with MCW totals $291.5 million and represents 7.0% of our total assets at December 31, 2007. Our
pro-rata share of the assets and net income of these ventures was $872.8 million and $6.7 million, respectively, which represents 21.1% and 3.6% of our total assets and net income available for common stockholders, respectively.

In December, 2006, we formed Regency Retail Partners, LP (the “Fund”), an open-end, infinite-life investment fund with an ownership interest of 26.8%.
During the first quarter of 2007, we reduced our ownership interest to 20% with the admission of additional partners into the Fund and recognized a gain of $2.2 million that had previously been deferred. The Fund has the right to acquire all future
Regency-developed large format community centers, upon stabilization, that meet the Fund’s investment criteria subject to the Fund’s capital availability. A community center is generally defined as a shopping center with at least 250,000
square feet of GLA including tenant-owned GLA. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund owned seven shopping centers, had total assets of $209.0 million and net income of $1.2 million for the year ended. Our share of the Fund’s total assets and
net income was $41.7 million and $325,861, respectively. Our share of the Fund represents 1.0% of our total assets and less than 1.0% of our net income available for common stockholders, respectively. During 2007, the Fund acquired six community
shopping centers from us for a sales price of $126.4 million or $102.8 million on a net basis. As part of the transaction we provided a short-term note receivable to the Fund of $12.1 million, which the Fund repaid to us in January 2008. We
recognized a gain of $42.8 million after excluding our ownership interest.



Index to Financial Statements

Recognition of gains from sales to co-investment partnerships is recorded on only that portion of the sales not
attributable to our ownership interest. The gains and operations are not recorded as discontinued operations because of our continuing involvement in these shopping centers. Columbia, RegCal, the co-investment partnerships with MCW, and the Fund
intend to continue to acquire retail shopping centers, some of which they may acquire directly from us. For those properties acquired from unrelated parties, we are required to contribute our pro-rata share of the purchase price to the partnerships.

Contractual Obligations

We have debt obligations related
to our mortgage loans, unsecured notes, and our unsecured line of credit as described further below. We have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to
us to construct and/or operate a shopping center. In addition, we have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business. The table excludes obligations for approximately $3.4 million related to
environmental remediation as discussed below under Environmental Matters as the timing of the remediation is not currently known. The table also excludes obligations related to construction or development contracts because payments are only due upon
the satisfactory performance under the contract. Costs necessary to complete the 49 development projects currently in process are estimated to be $447.4 million and will likely be expended through 2011. The following table summarizes our debt
maturities including interest, (excluding recorded debt premiums that are not obligations), and obligations under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2007 including our pro-rata share of obligations within unconsolidated
co-investment partnerships (in thousands):

are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest, and mature over various terms through 2018. We intend to repay mortgage loans at maturity from proceeds from our unsecured line of credit (the “Line”). Fixed interest
rates on mortgage loans range from 5.22% to 8.95% and average 6.37%. We have one variable rate mortgage loan with an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 100 basis points.

On June 5, 2007, RCLP completed the sale of $400.0 million of ten-year senior unsecured notes. The 5.875% notes are due June 15, 2017 and were priced at
99.527% to yield 5.938%. The net proceeds were used to reduce the Line.

In February 2007, we entered into a new loan agreement under the Line which
increased the commitment to $600.0 million with the right to increase the facility size an additional $150.0 million subject to additional lender syndication. The Line has a four-year term which expires in 2011 with a one-year extension at our
option and the interest rate was reduced to LIBOR plus .55%. Contractual interest rates were 5.425% at December 31, 2007 and 6.125% at December 31, 2006 based on LIBOR plus .55% and .75%, respectively. The balance on the Line was $208.0
million at December 31, 2007.

The spread on the Line is dependent upon maintaining specific investment-grade ratings. We are also required to
comply, and are in compliance, with certain financial covenants such as Minimum Net Worth, Total Liabilities to Gross Asset Value (“GAV”), Recourse Secured Debt to GAV, Fixed Charge Coverage and other covenants customary with this type of
unsecured financing. The Line is used primarily to finance the development and acquisition of real estate, but is also available for general working-capital purposes. On December 5, 2007, Standard and Poor’s Rating Services raised
Regency’s corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings to BBB+ from BBB. As a result of this upgrade, the interest rate on the Line was reduced to LIBOR plus .40% effective January 1, 2008.

As of December 31, 2007, scheduled principal repayments on notes payable and the Line were as follows (in thousands):

Our investments in real estate partnerships had notes and mortgage loans payable of $2.7 billion at
December 31, 2007, which mature through 2028. Our pro-rata share of these loans was $653.3 million, of which 93.6% had weighted average fixed interest rates of 5.3% and the remaining had variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus a spread in a
range of 50 to 100 basis points. The loans are primarily non-recourse, but for those that are guaranteed by a joint venture, our liability does not extend beyond our economic interest in the joint venture.

We are exposed to capital market risk such as changes in interest rates. In order to manage the volatility related to interest-rate risk, we originate new
debt with fixed interest rates, or we may enter into interest-rate hedging arrangements. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We engage outside experts who evaluate and make recommendations about
hedging strategies when appropriate. We account for derivative instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” as amended (“Statement
133”). On March 10, 2006, we entered into four forward-starting interest rate swaps totaling $396.7 million with fixed rates of 5.399%, 5.415%, 5.399% and 5.415%. We



Index to Financial Statements

designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to fix the rate on $400.0 million of new financing expected to occur in 2010 and 2011, and these proceeds will be used to
repay maturing debt at that time. The change in fair value of these swaps from inception was a liability of $9.8 million at December 31, 2007, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet and in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss).

At December 31, 2007, 89.4% of our total debt had fixed interest rates, compared with 88.0% at December 31, 2006. We intend to limit the percentage of variable interest-rate debt to be no more than 30% of total debt, which we
believe to be an acceptable risk. Currently, our variable rate debt represents 10.7% of our total debt. Based upon the variable interest-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2007, if variable interest rates were to increase by 1%, our annual
interest expense would increase by $2.1 million.

On February 26, 2008, we were notified by Wells Fargo Bank that they had received commitments
from a group of banks, which in combination with their commitment will provide us with an estimated $341.5 million, three-year term loan facility (the “Term Facility”). The Term Facility will include a term loan amount of $227.7 million
that will fund at closing plus a $113.8 million revolver component that is accessible by us at our discretion. The Term Facility will be subject to similar loan covenants that are contained within the Line and our other unsecured fixed rate loans.
The term loan has a variable interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 105 basis points, and the revolver has a variable interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 110 basis points, both of which are subject to our current debt ratings. The Term Facility does not
affect the Company’s existing $600.0 million Line commitment. The proceeds from the funding of the Term Facility will be used for general working capital purposes including the reduction of any debt balances, at our discretion. The Term
Facility is expected to close during March 2008 subject to final terms and conditions.

Equity Transactions

From time to time, we issue equity in the form of exchangeable operating partnership units or preferred units of RCLP, or in the form of common or preferred stock
of Regency Centers Corporation. As previously discussed, these sources of long-term equity financing allow us to fund our growth while maintaining a conservative capital structure.

Preferred Units

We have issued Preferred Units in various
amounts since 1998, the net proceeds of which were used to reduce the balance of the Line. We issue Preferred Units primarily to institutional investors in private placements. Generally, the Preferred Units may be exchanged by the holders for
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock after a specified date at an exchange rate of one share for one unit. The Preferred Units and the related Preferred Stock are not convertible into Regency common stock. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, only
the Series D Preferred Units were outstanding with a face value of $50.0 million and a fixed distribution rate of 7.45%. These Units may be called by us in 2009, and have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption. Included in the Series D Preferred
Units are original issuance costs of $842,023 that will be expensed if they are redeemed in the future.

Preferred Stock

As of December 31, 2007 we had three series of Preferred stock outstanding, two of which underlie
depositary shares held by the public. The depositary shares each represent 1/10

th

of a share of the underlying preferred stock and have a liquidation preference of $25
per depository share. In 2003, we issued 7.45% Series 3 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock underlying three million depositary shares. In 2004, we issued 7.25% Series 4 Cumulative Redeemable preferred stock underlying five million depositary
shares. In 2005, we issued three million shares, or $75.0 million of 6.70% Series 5 Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25 per share. All series of Preferred Stock are perpetual, are not convertible into common stock of the Company
and are redeemable at par upon our election beginning five years after the issuance date. The terms of the Preferred Stock do not contain any unconditional obligations that would require us to redeem the securities at any time or for any purpose.

On January 1, 2008, the Company split each share of existing Series 3 and Series 4 Preferred Stock each having a liquidation preference of $250
per share and a redemption price of $250 per share into ten shares of Series 3 and Series 4 Stock, respectively, each having a liquidation preference of $25 per share and a redemption price of $25 per



Index to Financial Statements

share. The Company then exchanged each Series 3 and 4 Depository Share into shares of New Series 3 and 4 Stock, respectively, which have the same dividend rights and
other rights and preferences identical to the depositary shares.

Common Stock

On April 5, 2005, we entered into an agreement to sell 4,312,500 shares of common stock to an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
(“Citigroup”) at $46.60 per share, in connection with a forward sale agreement (the “Forward Sale Agreement”). On August 1, 2005, we issued 3,782,500 shares to Citigroup for net proceeds of approximately $175.5 million and
on September 7, 2005, the remaining 530,000 shares were issued for net proceeds of $24.4 million. The proceeds from the sales were used to reduce the Line and redeem the Series E and F Preferred Units.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Knowledge about our
accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial results, and discussion and analysis of these results. The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of
assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period. These accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical results, current
economic activity, and industry accounting standards. They are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different
assumptions could result in materially different estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness. However, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.

Revenue Recognition and Tenant Receivables—Tenant receivables represent revenues recognized in our financial statements, and include base rent, percentage
rent, and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes. We analyze tenant receivables, historical bad debt levels, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the
adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, we analyze the accounts of tenants in bankruptcy, and we estimate the recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. Our reported net income is directly affected by our estimate of
the recoverability of tenant receivables.

Recognition of Gains from the Sales of Real Estate—We account for profit recognition on sales of real
estate in accordance with SFAS Statement No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.” Profits from sales of real estate will not be recognized under the full accrual method by us unless (i) a sale has been consummated;
(ii) the buyer’s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property; (iii) we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership; and (iv) we do not have
significant continuing involvement with the property. Recognition of gains from sales to co-investment partnerships is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest.

Capitalization of Costs—We capitalize the acquisition of land, the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by
recording them into “Properties in Development” on our consolidated balance sheets and account for them in accordance with SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects” (SFAS 67)
and EITF Issue No. 97-11, “Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to Real Estate Property Acquisitions”. In summary, SFAS 67 establishes that a rental project changes from nonoperating to operating when it is substantially completed
and held available for occupancy. At that time, costs should no longer be capitalized. Other development costs include pre-development costs essential to the development of the property, as well as, interest, real estate taxes, and direct employee
costs incurred during the development period. Pre-development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits, legal, engineering and other professional fees related to evaluating the
feasibility of developing a shopping center. If we determine that the development of a specific project undergoing due diligence was no longer probable, we would immediately expense all related capitalized pre-development costs not considered
recoverable. At December 31, 2007 we had $22.7 million of capitalized pre-development costs and during 2007 we expensed $5.3 million related to developments that were no longer considered probable. Interest costs are capitalized into each
development project



Index to Financial Statements

based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended. We generally cease interest cost capitalization when
the property is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after substantial completion of the building shell. During 2007 we capitalized
interest on our development projects of $35.4 million. We have a large staff of employees who support the due diligence, land acquisition, construction, anchor leasing, and financial analysis (the “Investment Group”) of our development
program. All direct internal costs related to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project. During 2007 we capitalized $39.0 million of direct costs incurred by the Investment Group. If future accounting standards
were to limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized, or if our development activity were to decline significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs, we could incur a significant increase in our operating expenses and
a reduction in net income.

Real Estate Acquisitions—Upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, we estimate the fair value of
acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building and improvements), and identified intangible assets, liabilities (consisting of above- and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed debt in accordance with SFAS
No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“Statement 141”). Based on these estimates, we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We utilize methods similar to those used by independent
appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. We evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the revised remaining useful
life.

Valuation of Real Estate Investments—Our long-lived assets, primarily real estate held for investment, are carried at cost unless
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted. The review involves a number of
assumptions and estimates used to determine whether impairment exists. Depending on the asset, we use varying methods to determine fair value of the asset such as i) estimating discounted future cash flows, ii) determining resale values by market,
or iii) applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market. These methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the general economy
of those markets in which we operate, tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores. Capitalization rates may change and could rise above existing levels causing our real estate values to decline. If we determine that the carrying amount of
a property is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value, we will write down the asset to fair value for “held-and-used” assets and to fair value less costs to sell for “held-for-sale” assets.

Discontinued Operations—The application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held-for-sale on the
balance sheet, or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued, requires management to make certain significant judgments. In evaluating whether a property meets the criteria set forth by SFAS
No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“Statement 144”), we make a determination as to the point in time that it is probable that a sale will be consummated. Given the nature of all real
estate sales contracts, it is not unusual for such contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract. In addition, certain other matters critical to the final sale, such as
financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance. As a result, properties under contract may not close within the expected time period, or may not close at all. Due to these uncertainties, it is not likely that we can meet
the criteria of Statement 144 prior to the sale formally closing. Therefore, any properties categorized as held-for-sale represent only those properties that management has determined are probable to close within the requirements set forth in
Statement 144. Prior to sale, we evaluate the extent of involvement and significance of cash flows it will have with a property subsequent to its sale, in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as
discontinued. Consistent with Statement 144, any property sold in which we have significant continuing involvement or cash flows (most often sales to co-investment partnerships) is not considered to be discontinued. In addition, any property which
we sell to an unrelated third party, but we retain a property or asset management function, is not considered discontinued. Therefore, based on our evaluation of Statement 144, only properties sold, or to be sold, to unrelated third parties, where
we will have no significant continuing involvement or significant cash flows are classified as discontinued.



Index to Financial Statements

Investments in Real Estate Co-Investment Partnerships—In addition to owning real estate directly, we invest in
real estate through our co-investment partnerships (also referred to as joint ventures). Joint venturing provides us with a capital source to acquire real estate, and to earn our pro-rata share of the net income from the co-investment partnerships
in addition to fees for services. As asset and property manager, we conduct the business of the Unconsolidated Properties held in the co-investment partnerships in the same way that we conduct the business of the Consolidated Properties that are
wholly-owned; therefore, the Critical Accounting Policies as described are also applicable to our investments in the co-investment partnerships. We account for all investments in which we do not have a controlling financial interest using the equity
method. We have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities as defined in the FIN 46(R) and do not require consolidation under EITF 04-5 or SOP 78-9, and therefore, are subject to the voting interest model in determining our
basis of accounting. Major decisions, including property acquisitions and dispositions, financings, annual budgets and dissolution of the ventures are subject to the approval of all partners, or in the case of the Fund, its advisory committee.

Income Tax Status—The prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that we will continue to operate in order to qualify as
a REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. We are required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that we continue to qualify as a REIT. As a REIT, we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of
our distributions to stockholders. We evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our REIT status. Determining our taxable income, calculating distributions, and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain
judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code. Because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax laws and regulations, our
positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (“Statement 160”). This
Statement, among other things, establishes accounting and reporting standards for a parent company’s interest in a subsidiary. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15,
2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the statement.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R) “Business
Combinations” (“Statement 141(R)”). This Statement, among other things, establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. This Statement also establishes disclosure requirements of the acquirer to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the effect of the business combination. This Statement is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the statement.

In November 2007, the EITF issued Issue No. 07-6 “Accounting for the Sale of Real Estate to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for the Sales of Real Estate, When the Agreement Includes a
Buy-Sell Clause” (“EITF 07-6”). EITF 07-6 is applicable to investors who enter into an arrangement to create a jointly owned entity, one investor sells real estate to that entity, and a buy-sell clause is included. This EITF is
effective for new arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the EITF.

In February 2007, the FASB Issued Statement No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“Statement
159”). This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The Statement also establishes presentation and
disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. Statement 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007, although early adoption is allowed. We do not believe that the adoption of Statement 159 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.



Index to Financial Statements

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“Statement
157”). This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies to accounting pronouncements
that require or permit fair value measurements, except for share-based payment transactions under FASB Statement No. 123(R). This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In
February 2008, the FASB amended Statement 157 with FASB Staff Position “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (“FSP 157-2”) to delay the effective date of Statement 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities to be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Although Statement 157 will require remeasurements of the derivative financial instruments, the Company does not believe adoption of
this Statement will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements for either financial or nonfinancial assets or liabilities

In
July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for
uncertainties in income tax law. This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.
Under FIN 48, tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be
measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. We adopted this Interpretation
effective January 1, 2007. We do not have any material unrecognized tax benefits; therefore, the adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have appropriate support for the
income tax positions taken and to be taken on our tax returns and that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years (after 2003 for federal and state) based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and
interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.

Results from Operations

Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2007 to 2006:

At
December 31, 2007, on a Combined Basis, we were operating or developing 451 shopping centers, as compared to 405 shopping centers at the end of 2006. We identify our shopping centers as either development properties or operating properties.
Development properties are defined as properties that are in the construction or initial lease-up process and have not reached their initial full occupancy (reaching full occupancy generally means achieving at least 93% leased and rent paying on
newly constructed or renovated GLA). At December 31, 2007, on a Combined Basis, we were developing 49 properties, as compared to 47 properties at the end of 2006.

Our revenues increased by $34.5 million, or 8% to $451.5 million in 2007 as summarized in the following table (in thousands):

The increase in revenues was primarily related to higher minimum rent from (i) growth in rental rates
from renewing expiring leases or re-leasing vacant space in the operating properties, (ii) new minimum rent generated from recent shopping center acquisitions, and (iii) recently completed shopping center developments commencing operations
in the current year net of properties sold. In addition to collecting minimum rent from our tenants, we also collect percentage rent based upon their sales volumes. Recoveries from tenants represents reimbursements from



Index to Financial Statements

tenants for their pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers. Recoveries increased as a
result of an increase in our operating expenses.

We earn fees for asset management, property management, leasing, acquisition and financing services
that we provide to our co-investment partnerships and third parties summarized as follows (in thousands):

Property management fees increased in 2007 as a result of providing property management services to
MCWR-DESCO and the Fund. Asset management fees were higher in 2007 because the agreement to provide asset management services to MCWR II did not commence until December 2006; and the closing and related commencement of the agreements with the Fund
did not occur until December 2006. Acquisition and financing fees earned in 2007 include a $3.2 million acquisition fee from MCWR-DESCO related to the acquisition of 32 retail centers described above. Acquisition and financing fees earned in 2006
include fees earned as part of the acquisition of the First Washington portfolio by MCWR II.

Our operating expenses increased by $17.4 million, or
7%, to $256.8 million in 2007 related to increased operating and maintenance costs, general and administrative costs and depreciation expense, as further described below. The following table summarizes our operating expenses (in thousands):

The increase in operating, maintenance, and real estate taxes was primarily due to acquisitions and recently
completed developments commencing operations in the current year, and to general price increases incurred by the operating properties, net of properties sold. On average, approximately 80% of these costs are recovered from our tenants through
reimbursements included in our revenues.

The increase in general and administrative expense is related to annual salary increases and higher costs
associated with incentive compensation, in addition to, increased staffing and recruiting costs to manage the growth in our shopping center development program.

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to acquisitions and recently completed developments commencing operations in the current year, net of properties sold.

The decrease in other expenses is related to lower income tax expense incurred by Regency Realty Group, Inc. (“RRG”), our taxable REIT subsidiary. RRG is
subject to federal and state income taxes and files separate tax returns.



Index to Financial Statements

The following table presents the change in interest expense from 2007 to 2006 (in thousands):

Interest expense on the Line and notes payable increased during 2007 by $13.0 million due to higher
outstanding debt balances including the issuance of $400.0 million of unsecured debt in June 2007, increased development activity and the acquisition of shopping centers. The increase in development activity also resulted in an increase in
capitalized interest.

Our equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships (co-investment partnerships or joint ventures)
increased $15.5 million during 2007 as follows (in thousands):

The increase in our equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships is primarily related
to growth in rental income generally realized in all of the joint venture portfolios and higher gains from the sale of shopping centers sold by MCWR I, as well as, the sale of a shopping center owned by a joint venture classified above in Other
investments.

Gains from the sale of real estate were $52.2 million in 2007 as compared to $65.6 million in 2006. Included in 2007 gains are $8.9
million in gains from the sale of 28 out-parcels for net proceeds of $59.2 million, $42.8 million from the sale of six properties in development to a joint venture for net proceeds of $102.8 million; and a $2.2 million gain related to the partial
sale of our interest in the Fund as discussed previously. Included in 2006 gains are $20.2 million in gains from the sale of 30 out-parcels for net proceeds of $53.5 million, $35.9 million from the sale of six shopping centers to co-investment
partnerships for net proceeds of $122.7 million; as well as a $9.5 million gain related to the partial sale of our interest in MCWR II as previously discussed. These gains are included in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations
because they were either properties that had no operating income, or they were properties sold to co-investment partnerships where we have continuing involvement through our equity investment.

Income from discontinued operations was $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to two operating properties and four development properties
sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of $109.0 million. Income from discontinued operations was $63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to eight operating properties and three development properties sold to unrelated
parties for net proceeds of $149.6 million and to the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as held-for-sale in 2006 and 2007. In compliance with Statement 144, if we sell an asset in the current year, we are required to re-present its
operations into discontinued



Index to Financial Statements

operations for all prior periods. This practice results in a re-presentation of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations. Our
income from discontinued operations is shown net of minority interest of exchangeable operating partnership units totaling $225,833 and $830,793 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and income taxes totaling $2.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Net income for common stockholders decreased $14.9 million to $184.0 million in 2007 as compared
with $198.8 million in 2006 primarily related to lower gains recognized from the sale of real estate in 2007. Diluted earnings per share was $2.65 in 2007 as compared to $2.89 in 2006 or 8% lower.

Results from Operations

Comparison of the years ended December 31,
2006 to 2005:

At December 31, 2006, on a Combined Basis, we were operating or developing 405 shopping centers, as compared to 393 shopping
centers at the end of 2005. At December 31, 2006, on a Combined Basis, we were developing 47 properties, as compared to 31 properties at the end of 2005.

Our revenues increased by $33.3 million, or 9%, to $417.0 million in 2006 as summarized in the following table (in thousands):

The increase in revenues was primarily related to higher minimum rent from growth in rental rates from
renewing expiring leases or re-leasing vacant space in the operating properties, and from new minimum rent generated from recently completed developments commencing operations in the current year net of properties sold. Recoveries from tenants,
which represent reimbursements from tenants for their pro-rata share of the operating expenses that we incur to operating our shopping centers, increased 10.5% during 2006 directly related to a 16.6% increase in our operating expenses.

We earn fees for asset management, property management, leasing, investing, and financing services that we provide to our co-investment partnerships and third
parties summarized as follows (in thousands):

Property management fees increased in 2006 as a result of managing the First Washington Portfolio
acquisition for MCWR II for an entire 12 months during 2006 as compared to seven months during 2005. This also resulted in higher leasing commissions earned during 2006. Acquisition and financing fees were lower in 2006 due to a lower level of
acquisition activity in 2006 as compared to 2005. Fees earned in 2005 were primarily related to the acquisition of the First Washington Portfolio by MCWR II. During 2006, we earned additional fees from MCWR II for achieving certain income
performance results related to the First Washington Portfolio.



Index to Financial Statements

Our operating expenses increased by $34.1 million, or 17%, to $239.4 million in 2006 related to increased operating
and maintenance costs, general and administrative costs and depreciation expense, as further described below. The following table summarizes our operating expenses (in thousands):

The increase in operating, maintenance, and real estate taxes was primarily due to shopping center
developments that were recently completed and did not incur operating expenses for a full 12 months during the previous year, and to general price increases incurred by the operating properties, net of properties sold. On average, approximately 80%
of these costs are recovered from our tenants as expense reimbursements and included in our revenues.

The increase in general and administrative
expense is related to additional salary costs for new employees hired to manage the First Washington Portfolio under a property management agreement with MCWR II, as well as, staffing increases related to increases in our shopping center development
program.

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to new development properties recently completed and placed in
service in the current year, net of properties sold, or if placed in service in the previous year, were not operational for a full 12 months.

The
increase in other expenses pertains to an increase in the income tax provision of RRG, our taxable REIT subsidiary, from $4.1 million in 2005 to $11.8 million in 2006. RCLP also incurred intangible taxes of $1.8 million in 2006 as compared to
$352,416 in 2005.

The following table presents the change in interest expense from 2006 to 2005:

Interest expense on the Line and notes payable increased due to higher outstanding balances on the Line
during the year associated with an increase in properties in development and the acquisitions purchased in 2006. The increase in development activity also resulted in an increase in capitalized interest.



Index to Financial Statements

Our equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships (co-investment partnerships or joint
ventures) increased $5.5 million to $2.6 million in 2006 as follows (in thousands):

The increase was primarily a result of MCWR II earning revenues for a full year from the First Washington
Portfolio as compared to seven months during 2005. MCWR I recorded higher gains from the sale of real estate during 2006 as compared to 2005. Columbia recorded lower gains from the sale of real estate during 2006 as compared to 2005.

Gains from the sale of real estate were $65.6 million in 2006 as compared to $19.0 million in 2005. Included in 2006 are gains of $20.2 million from the sale of 30
out-parcels for net proceeds of $53.5 million, $35.9 million from the sale of six shopping centers to co-investment partnerships for net proceeds of $122.7 million; and a $9.5 million gain related to the partial sale of our interest in MCWR II as
discussed previously. Included in 2005 are gains of $8.7 million in gains from the sale of 26 out-parcels for net proceeds of $29.0 million and $10.3 million in gains related to the sale of three development properties and one operating property.
These gains are included in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations because they were either properties that had no operating income, or they were properties sold to co-investment partnerships where we have continuing involvement
through our equity investment.

We review our real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may
not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset. We determine whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property’s carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon methods described in our Critical Accounting Policies. In
the event a property is impaired, we write down the asset to fair value for “held-and-used” assets and to fair value less costs to sell for “held-for- sale” assets. During 2006 and 2005 we established provisions for loss of
$500,000 and $550,000 respectively, to adjust operating properties to their estimated fair values.

Income from discontinued operations was $63.1
million in 2006 related to eight operating and three development properties sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of $149.6 million. Income from discontinued operations was $65.1 million in 2005 related to nine operating and five development
properties sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of $175.2 million and to the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as held-for-sale in 2006 and 2005. In compliance with Statement 144, if we sell an asset in the current year, we are
required to reclassify its operating income into discontinued operations for all prior periods. This practice results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations. Our income from
discontinued operations is shown net of minority interest of exchangeable operating partnership units totaling $830,793 and $1.3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and income taxes totaling $3.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2005.

Minority interest of preferred units declined $4.4 million to $3.7 million in 2006 as a result of redeeming
$125.0 million of preferred units in 2005. Preferred stock dividends increased $2.9 million to $19.7 million in 2006 as a result of the issuance of $75.0 million of preferred stock in 2005.



Index to Financial Statements

Net income for common stockholders increased $52.9 million to $198.8 million in 2006 as compared with $145.9
million in 2005 primarily related to increases in revenues described above and higher gains recognized from sale of real estate. Diluted earnings per share was $2.89 in 2006 as compared to $2.23 in 2005 or 30% higher.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous environmental laws and
regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks (UST’s). We believe that the tenants who
currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations. Generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to
non-chlorinated solvent systems. Where available, we have applied and been accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs. We have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against third-party liabilities and remediation costs on
shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination. We have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk. We monitor the
shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites. We also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so. We estimate the cost associated with these legal
obligations to be approximately $3.4 million, all of which has been reserved. We believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material affect on our financial position, liquidity, or operations;
however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental
condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable
environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.

Inflation

Inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, more recently inflation has been
increasing and may become a greater concern within the current economy. Substantially all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive
percentage rent based on tenants’ gross sales, which generally increase as prices rise; and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses are often related to increases in
the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. Most of our leases require tenants to pay their
pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market Risk

We are exposed to two components of interest-rate risk. Our Line has a variable interest rate that is based upon LIBOR plus a spread of 55 basis points. LIBOR rates
charged on the Line change monthly. Based upon our current Line balance, a 1% increase in LIBOR would equate to an additional $2.1 million of interest costs per year. The spread on the Line is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings. If
our credit ratings were downgraded, the spread on the Line would increase resulting in higher interest costs. We are also exposed to higher interest rates when we refinance our existing long-term fixed rate debt. The objective of our interest-rate
risk management is to limit the impact of interest-rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial
instruments such as interest-rate swaps, caps or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest-rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not enter into derivative or interest-rate transactions for speculative purposes. We have
approximately $428.1 million of fixed rate debt maturing in 2010 and 2011, which includes $400.0 million of unsecured long-term debt. During 2006 we entered into four forward-starting interest rate swaps totaling $396.7 million with fixed rates of
5.399%, 5.415%, 5.399% and 5.415%. We designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to fix the future interest rates on the $400.0 million of financing expected to occur in 2010 and 2011.

Our interest-rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal cash flows (in thousands), weighted average interest
rates of remaining debt, and the fair value of total debt (in thousands) as of December 31, 2007, by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest-rate changes.

As the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2007, it does not consider
those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. Moreover, because firm commitments are not presented in the table above, the information presented above has limited predictive value. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss
with respect to interest-rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time, and actual interest rates.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Regency Centers Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regency Centers Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2007. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule III. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Regency
Centers Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Regency
Centers Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Regency Centers Corporation:

We have audited Regency Centers Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Regency Centers Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Regency Centers Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Regency Centers Corporation as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and our report dated February 27, 2008,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2007

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Organization and Principles of Consolidation

General

Regency Centers Corporation (“Regency” or the “Company”) began its operations as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) in 1993, and
is the managing general partner of its operating partnership, Regency Centers, L.P. (“RCLP” or the “Partnership”). Regency currently owns approximately 99% of the outstanding common partnership units (“Units”) of the
Partnership. Regency engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, and development of retail shopping centers through the Partnership, and has no other assets or liabilities other than through its investment in the Partnership. At
December 31, 2007, the Partnership directly owned 232 retail shopping centers and held partial interests in an additional 219 retail shopping centers through investments in joint ventures.

Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company, the Partnership, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and joint ventures in which the Partnership has a controlling interest. The equity interests of third parties held in the Partnership or its controlled joint ventures are
included in the consolidated financial statements as preferred units, exchangeable operating partnership units, or limited partners’ interest in consolidated partnerships. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been
eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Investments in real estate partnerships not controlled by the Company (“Unconsolidated
Joint Ventures”) are accounted for under the equity method. The Company has evaluated its investment in the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and has concluded that they are not variable interest entities as defined in Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R) “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46(R)”). Further, the venture partners in the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures have significant ownership rights,
including approval over operating budgets and strategic plans, capital spending, sale or financing, and admission of new partners; therefore, the Company has concluded that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for these interests and they
do not require consolidation under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5 “Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have
Certain Rights” (“EITF 04-5”) or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) Statement of Position 78-9, “Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures” (“SOP 78-9”). Under
the equity method of accounting, investments in the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently increased for additional contributions and allocations of income and reduced for distributions received and allocation
of losses. These investments are included in the consolidated financial statements as Investments in real estate partnerships.

Ownership of the Company

Regency has a single class of common stock outstanding and three series of preferred stock outstanding (“Series 3, 4, and 5 Preferred
Stock”). The dividends on the Series 3, 4, and 5 Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter. The Company owns corresponding Series 3, 4, and 5 preferred unit interests (“Series 3, 4, and
5 Preferred Units”) in the Partnership that entitle the Company to income and distributions from the Partnership in amounts equal to the dividends paid on the Company’s Series 3, 4, and 5 Preferred Stock.

Ownership of the Operating Partnership

The Partnership’s capital
includes general and limited common Partnership Units, Series 3, 4, and 5 Preferred Units owned by the Company, and Series D Preferred Units owned by institutional investors.



Index to Financial Statements

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

December 31, 2007

(a) Organization and Principles of Consolidation (continued)

At December 31, 2007, the Company owned approximately 99% or 69,638,637 Partnership Units of the total 70,112,248 Partnership Units outstanding. Each
outstanding common Partnership Unit not owned by the Company is exchangeable for one share of Regency common stock. The Company revalues the minority interest associated with the Partnership Units each quarter to maintain a proportional relationship
between the book value of equity associated with common stockholders relative to that of the Partnership Unit holders since both have equivalent rights and the Partnership Units are convertible into shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.

Net income and distributions of the Partnership are allocable first to the Preferred Units, and the remaining amounts to the general and limited
Partnership Units in accordance with their ownership percentage. The Series 3, 4, and 5 Preferred Units owned by the Company are eliminated in consolidation.

(b)
Revenues

The Company leases space to tenants under agreements with varying terms. Leases are accounted for as operating leases with minimum rent
recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease regardless of when payments are due. Accrued rents are included in tenant receivables. The Company makes estimates of the collectibility of the accounts receivable related to base rents,
straight-line rents, expense reimbursements, and other revenue taking into consideration the Company’s experience in the retail sector, available internal and external tenant credit information, payment history, industry trends, tenant
credit-worthiness, and remaining lease terms. In some cases, primarily relating to straight-line rents, the collection of these amounts extends beyond one year. As part of the leasing process, the Company may provide the lessee with an allowance for
the construction of leasehold improvements. These leasehold improvements are capitalized as part of the building, recorded as tenant improvements, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term. If the
allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event the Company is not considered the owner of the improvements, the allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease
term as a reduction of rental revenue. Factors considered during this evaluation include, among others, who holds legal title to the improvements as well as other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement (e.g. unilateral control of the
tenant space during the build-out process). Determination of the appropriate accounting for the payment of a tenant allowance is made on a lease-by-lease basis, considering the facts and circumstances of the individual tenant lease.

Recognition of lease revenue commences when the lessee is given possession of the leased space upon completion of tenant improvements when the Company is the owner
of the leasehold improvements. However, when the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant, the lease inception date is when the tenant obtains possession of the leased space for purposes of constructing its leasehold improvements.

Substantially all of the lease agreements contain provisions that provide for additional rents based on tenants’ sales volume (percentage rent) and
reimbursement of the tenants’ share of real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance (“CAM”) costs. Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements.
Recovery of real estate taxes, insurance, and CAM costs are recognized as the respective costs are incurred in accordance with the lease agreements.

The Company accounts for profit recognition on sales of real estate in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate” (“Statement 66”).
In summary, profits from sales will not be recognized under the full accrual method by the Company unless a sale is consummated; the buyer’s initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property;
the Company’s receivable, if applicable, is not subject to future subordination; the Company has transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership; and the Company does not have substantial continuing involvement with the
property.

December 31, 2007

(b) Revenues (Continued)

The Company has been engaged by joint ventures under agreements to provide asset management, property
management, leasing, investing, and financing services for such ventures’ shopping centers. The fees are market-based and generally calculated as a percentage of either revenues earned or the estimated values of the properties managed, and are
recognized as services are rendered, when fees due are determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

(c) Real Estate Investments

Land, buildings, and improvements are recorded at cost. All specifically identifiable costs related to development activities are capitalized into properties in
development on the consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects” (“Statement 67”). In summary, Statement 67
establishes that a rental project changes from nonoperating to operating when it is substantially completed and held available for occupancy. At that time, costs should no longer be capitalized. The capitalized costs include pre-development costs
essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, and direct employee costs incurred during the period of development.

The Company incurs costs prior to land acquisition including contract deposits, as well as legal, engineering, and other external professional fees related to
evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center. These pre-development costs are included in properties in development. If the Company determines that the development of a particular shopping center is no longer probable, any related
pre-development costs previously capitalized are immediately expensed. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had capitalized pre-development costs of $22.7 million and $23.3 million, respectively of which $10.8 million and $10.0 million,
respectively were refundable deposits.

The Company’s method of capitalizing interest is based upon applying its weighted average borrowing rate
to that portion of the actual development costs expended. The Company generally ceases interest cost capitalization when the property is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would the Company
capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after substantial completion of the building shell.

Maintenance and repairs that do not improve
or extend the useful lives of the respective assets are recorded in operating and maintenance expense.

Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, the shorter of the useful life or the lease term for tenant improvements, and three to seven years for furniture and equipment.

The Company and the unconsolidated joint ventures allocate the purchase price of assets acquired (net tangible and identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities
assumed based on their relative fair values at the date of acquisition pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“Statement 141”). Statement 141 provides guidance on the allocation of a portion of
the purchase price of a property to intangible assets. The Company’s methodology for this allocation includes estimating an “as-if vacant” fair value of the physical property, which is allocated to land, building, and improvements.
The difference between the purchase price and the “as-if vacant” fair value is allocated to intangible assets. There are three categories of intangible assets to be considered: (i) value of in-place leases, (ii) above and
below-market value of in-place leases, and (iii) customer relationship value.

The value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value
associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period. The value of in-place leases is recorded to
amortization expense over the remaining initial term of the respective leases.



Index to Financial Statements

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

December 31, 2007

(c) Real Estate Investments (Continued)

Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present
value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining
non-cancelable term of the lease. The value of above-market leases is amortized as a reduction of minimum rent over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The value of below- market leases is accreted as an increase to minimum rent over the
remaining terms of the respective leases, including below-market renewal options, if applicable. The Company does not allocate value to customer relationship intangibles if it has pre-existing business relationships with the major retailers in the
acquired property since they do not provide incremental value over the Company’s existing relationships.

The Company follows the provisions of
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“Statement 144”). In accordance with Statement 144, the Company classifies an operating property or a property in development as held-for-sale
when the Company determines that the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, the property is being actively marketed for sale, and management believes it is probable that a sale will be consummated. Given the nature of all
real estate sales contracts, it is not unusual for such contracts to allow prospective buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract. In addition, certain other matters critical to the final sale, such
as financing arrangements, often remain pending even upon contract acceptance. As a result, properties under contract may not close within the expected time period, or may not close at all. Due to these uncertainties, it is not likely that the
Company can meet the criteria of Statement 144 prior to the sale formally closing. Therefore, any properties categorized as held-for-sale represent only those properties that management has determined are probable to close within the requirements
set forth in Statement 144. Operating properties held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation and amortization are suspended during the held-for-sale period.

In accordance with Statement 144, when the Company sells a property or classifies a property as held-for-sale and will not have significant continuing involvement
in the operation of the property, the operations and cash flows of the property are eliminated from ongoing operations. Its operations, including any mortgage interest and gain on sale, are reported in discontinued operations so that the operations
and cash flows are clearly distinguished. Once classified in discontinued operations, these properties are eliminated from ongoing operations. Prior periods are also re-presented to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued
operations. When the Company sells operating properties to its joint ventures or to third parties, and will have continuing involvement, the operations and gains on sales are included in income from continuing operations.

The Company reviews its real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable
based upon expected undiscounted cash flows from the property. The Company determines impairment by comparing the property’s carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon varying methods such as i) estimating future discounted cash
flows, ii) determining resale values by market, or iii) applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market. These methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of
factors, including changes in the general economy of those markets in which the Company operates, tenant credit quality, and demand for new retail stores. In the event that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable and exceeds its fair
value, the Company will write down the asset to fair value for “held-and-used” assets and to fair value less costs to sell for “held-for-sale” assets. During 2006 and 2005, the Company established a provision for loss of $500,000
and $550,000 based upon the criteria described above. If there was an impairment recorded on properties subsequently sold to third parties it would be included in operating income from discontinued operations.

(d) Income Taxes

The
Company believes it qualifies, and intends to continue to qualify, as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). As a REIT, the Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its
stockholders are at least equal to REIT taxable income.

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Earnings
and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to stockholders, differs from net income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily because of differences in depreciable lives and cost bases of the shopping centers, as well as
other timing differences.

The net book basis of real estate assets exceeds the tax basis by approximately $161.2 million and $158.4 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, primarily due to the difference between the cost basis of the assets acquired and their carryover basis recorded for tax purposes.

The following summarizes the tax status of dividends paid during the respective years:

Regency Realty Group, Inc. (“RRG”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RCLP, is a Taxable REIT
Subsidiary as defined in Section 856(l) of the Code. RRG is subject to federal and state income taxes and files separate tax returns. Income tax expense consists of the following for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in
thousands):

Income tax expense is included in either other expenses if the related income is from continuing operations
or discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations as follows for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 (in thousands):

(d) Income Taxes (Continued)

Income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate of 35% to
pretax income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively and 34% for the year ended December 31, 2005 as follows (in thousands):

All other items principally represent the tax effect of gains associated with the sale of properties to
unconsolidated ventures.

RRG had net deferred tax assets of $8.8 million and $9.7 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
majority of the deferred tax assets relate to deferred interest expense and tax costs capitalized on projects under development. No valuation allowance was provided and the Company believes it is more likely than not that the future benefits
associated with these deferred tax assets will be realized.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law. This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the
financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Under FIN 48, tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it
is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being
realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. The Company adopted this Interpretation effective January 1, 2007. The Company does not have any material unrecognized tax
benefits; therefore, the adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax
returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years (after 2003 for federal and state) based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each
matter.

(e) Deferred Costs

Deferred costs include leasing costs
and loan costs, net of accumulated amortization. Such costs are amortized over the periods through lease expiration or loan maturity, respectively. Deferred leasing costs consist of internal and external commissions associated with leasing the
Company’s shopping centers. Net deferred leasing costs were $41.2 million and $33.3 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Deferred loan costs consist of initial direct and incremental costs associated with financing
activities. Net deferred loan costs were $11.6 million and $7.7 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(f) Earnings per Share and Treasury Stock

The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share” (“Statement 128”). Basic
earnings per share of common stock is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the conversion of obligations and the assumed

(f) Earnings per Share and Treasury Stock (Continued)

exercises of securities including the effects of shares issuable under the Company’s share-based payment arrangements, if dilutive. See Note 11 for the
calculation of earnings per share (“EPS”).

Repurchases of the Company’s common stock are recorded at cost and are reflected as
Treasury stock in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss). Outstanding shares do not include treasury shares.

(g)
Cash and Cash Equivalents

Any instruments which have an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, $8.0 million and $2.3 million of the cash available was restricted, respectively.

(h) Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company’s management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(i) Stock-Based Compensation

Regency grants stock-based compensation to its employees and directors. When Regency issues common shares as compensation, it receives a comparable number of common units from the Partnership including stock options. Regency is
committed to contribute to the Partnership all proceeds from the exercise of stock options or other share-based awards granted under Regency’s Long-Term Omnibus Plan (the “Plan”). Accordingly, Regency’s ownership in the
Partnership will increase based on the amount of proceeds contributed to the Partnership for the common units it receives. As a result of the issuance of common units to Regency for stock-based compensation, the Partnership accounts for stock-based
compensation in the same manner as Regency.

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R)
“Share-Based Payment” (“Statement 123(R)”). The Company adopted Statement 123(R) effective January 1, 2005 by applying the “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the
effective date (a) based on the requirements of Statement 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of Statement 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the
effective date of Statement 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. See Note 10 for further discussion.

(j) Segment Reporting

The Company’s business is investing in retail shopping centers through direct ownership or through joint ventures. The Company actively manages its portfolio
of retail shopping centers and may from time to time make decisions to sell lower performing properties or developments not meeting its long-term investment objectives. The proceeds from sales are reinvested into higher quality retail shopping
centers through acquisitions or new developments, which management believes will meet its planned rate of return. It is management’s intent that all retail shopping centers will be owned or developed for investment purposes; however, the
Company may decide to sell all or a portion of a development upon completion. The Company’s revenue and net income are generated from the operation of its investment portfolio. The Company also earns fees from third parties for services
provided to manage and lease retail shopping centers owned through joint ventures.

December 31, 2007

(j) Segment Reporting (Continued)

The Company’s portfolio is located throughout the United States; however, management does not distinguish
or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of allocating resources or measuring performance. The Company reviews operating and financial data for each property on an individual basis; therefore, the Company defines an operating
segment as its individual properties. No individual property constitutes more than 10% of the Company’s combined revenue, net income or assets, and thus the individual properties have been aggregated into one reportable segment based upon their
similarities with regard to both the nature and economics of the centers, tenants and operational processes, as well as long-term average financial performance. In addition, no single tenant accounts for 6% or more of revenue and none of the
shopping centers are located outside the United States.

(k) Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“Statement 133”) as amended by SFAS
No. 149 “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”. Statement 133 requires that all derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, be recorded on the balance sheet at
their fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The Company’s use of derivative financial
instruments is normally to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or forecasted transaction through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.

Statement 133 requires that changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges be recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”)
while the ineffective portion of the derivative’s change in fair value be recognized in the income statement as interest expense. Upon the settlement of a hedge, gains and losses associated with the transaction are recorded in OCI and amortized
over the underlying term of the hedge transaction. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge
transactions. The Company assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items.

In assessing the hedge, the Company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models,
and termination costs at each balance sheet date. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. See Note 8 for further discussion.

(l) Redeemable Minority Interests

EITF D-98 “Classification and
Measurement of Redeemable Securities,” clarifies Rule 5-02.28 of Regulation S-X. This rule requires securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent equity if they are redeemable for (i) at a fixed
or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date; (ii) at the option of the holder; or (iii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. Minority interest in the operating partnership is classified as
minority interest of exchangeable operating partnership units (“OP Units”) in the accompanying balance sheets. These OP Units are redeemable at the option of the holder for a like number of shares of common stock of Regency or cash, at the
Company’s discretion. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were 473,611 and 740,826 redeemable OP Units outstanding, respectively. The redemption value of the redeemable OP Units is based on the closing market price of Regency Centers
Corporation common stock, which was $64.49 per share as of December 31, 2007 and $78.17 per share as of December 31, 2006 and aggregated $30.5 million and $57.9 million, respectively.

(m) Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity”
(“Statement 150”). Statement 150 affects the accounting for certain financial instruments, which requires companies having consolidated entities with specified termination dates to treat minority owners’ interests in such entities as
liabilities in an amount based on the fair value of the entities. Although Statement 150 was originally effective July 1, 2003, the FASB has indefinitely deferred certain provisions related to classification and measurement requirements for
mandatory redeemable financial instruments that become subject to Statement 150 solely as a result of consolidation, including minority interests of entities with specified termination dates.

At December 31, 2007, the Company held a majority interest in four consolidated entities with specified termination dates through 2049. The minority
owners’ interests in these entities will be settled upon termination by distribution or transfer of either cash or specific assets of the underlying entities. The estimated fair value of minority interests in entities with specified termination
dates was approximately $10.2 million at December 31, 2007. Their related carrying value is $5.7 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively which is included within limited partners’ interest in
consolidated partnerships in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company has no other financial instruments that are affected by Statement 150.

(n)
Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements” (“Statement 160”). This Statement, among other things, establishes accounting and reporting standards for a parent company’s interest in a subsidiary. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the statement.

In December
2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R) “Business Combinations” (“Statement 141(R)”). This Statement, among other things, establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial
statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. This Statement also establishes disclosure requirements of the acquirer to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate
the effect of the business combination. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The impact on the Company will be reflected at the time of any acquisition which meets
the requirement.

In November 2007, the EITF issued Issue No. 07-6 “Accounting for the Sale of Real Estate to the Requirements of FASB
Statement No. 66, Accounting for the Sales of Real Estate, When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause” (“EITF 07-6”). EITF 07-6 is applicable to investors who enter into an arrangement to create a jointly owned entity, one
investor sells real estate to that entity, and a buy-sell clause is included. This EITF is effective for new arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this EITF.

In February 2007, the FASB Issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“Statement 159”). This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at
fair value. The Statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. Statement 159 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, although early application is allowed. The Company does not believe that the adoption of Statement 159 will have a material effect on its consolidated
financial statements.

(n) Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Continued)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“Statement
157”). This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies to accounting pronouncements
that require or permit fair value measurements, except for share-based payments transactions under Statement 123(R). This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February
2008, the FASB amended Statement 157 with FASB Staff Position “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (“FSP 157-2”) to delay the effective date of Statement 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to be
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Although Statement 157 will require remeasurements of the derivative financial instruments, the Company does not believe adoption of this Statement
will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements for either financial or nonfinancial assets or liabilities.

(o) Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2006 and 2005 amounts to conform to classifications adopted in 2007.

2. Real Estate Investments

During 2007, the Company acquired five
shopping centers for a purchase price of $106.0 million which included the assumption of $42.3 million in debt, recorded net of a $1.2 million debt discount. Acquired lease intangible assets and acquired lease intangible liabilities of $9.3 million
and $4.7 million, respectively, were recorded for these acquisitions. During 2006, the Company acquired one shopping center for a purchase price of $63.1 million which included the assumption of $44.0 million in debt. In accordance with Statement
141, acquired lease intangible assets and acquired lease intangible liabilities of $6.1 million and $5.0 million, respectively were recorded for this acquisition. The acquisitions in 2007 and 2006 were accounted for as purchase business combinations
and their results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

3. Discontinued Operations

Regency maintains a conservative capital structure to fund its growth program without compromising its investment-grade ratings. This approach is founded on a
self-funding business model which utilizes center “recycling” as a key component and requires ongoing monitoring of each center to ensure that it meets Regency’s investment standards. This recycling strategy calls for the Company to
sell properties that do not measure up to its standards and re-deploy the proceeds into new, higher-quality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns.

3. Discontinued Operations (Continued)

During 2007, the Company sold 100% of its interest in six properties for net proceeds of $109.0 million. The
combined operating income and gain from these properties were reclassified to discontinued operations. The revenues from properties included in discontinued operations, includes properties sold in 2007, 2006, and 2005, and operating properties
held-for-sale, were $4.4 million, $15.4 million, and $32.7 million, for the three years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, the Company did not have any properties classified as held-for-sale.
The operating income and gains from properties included in discontinued operations are reported net of minority interest of exchangeable operating partnership units and income taxes, if the property is sold by RRG and, are summarized as follows for
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 (in thousands):

4. Investments in Real Estate Partnerships

The Company accounts for all investments in which it owns 50% or less and does not have a controlling financial interest using the equity method. The Company has
determined that these investments are not variable interest entities as defined in FIN 46(R) and do not require consolidation under EITF 04-5 or SOP 78-9, and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining its basis of accounting.
Major decisions, including property acquisitions and dispositions, financings, annual budgets, and dissolution of the ventures are subject to the approval of all partners. The Company’s investment in these partnerships was $432.9 million and
$434.1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The difference between the carrying amount of these investments and the underlying equity in net assets was $17.8 million and $18.1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. This amount is accreted to equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships over the expected useful lives of the properties and other intangible assets which range in lives from 10 to 40 years. Net income or loss from these
partnerships, which includes all operating results and gains on sales of properties within the joint ventures, is allocated to the Company in accordance with the respective partnership agreements. Such allocations of net income or loss are recorded
in equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Cash distributions
of normal operating earnings from investments in real estate partnerships are presented in cash flows from operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash distributions from the sale of a property or loan proceeds received from the
placement of debt on a property included in investments in real estate partnerships are presented in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Investments in real estate partnerships are comprised primarily of joint ventures with three unrelated co-investment partners and a recently formed open-end real
estate fund (“Regency Retail Partners” or the “Fund”), as further described below. In addition to the Company earning its pro-rata share of net income (loss) in each of the partnerships, these partnerships pay the Company fees
for asset management, property management, leasing, investing, and financing services. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded fees from these joint ventures of $32.3 million, $30.9 million and $26.8 million, respectively.

4. Investments in Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)

The Company co-invests with the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund in three joint ventures (collectively
“Columbia”) in which the Company has ownership interests of 20% or 30%. As of December 31, 2007, Columbia owned 28 shopping centers, had total assets of $648.2 million and net income of $12.7 million for the year then ended of which
the Company’s share of the venture’s total assets and net income was $142.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively. During 2007, Columbia acquired eight shopping centers from third parties for $88.7 million. The Company contributed $9.3
million for its proportionate share of the purchase price, which was net of $15.2 million of assumed mortgage debt and $31.1 million in financing obtained by Columbia. During 2006 Columbia acquired four shopping centers from third parties for $97.0
million. The Company contributed $9.6 million for its proportionate share of the purchase price, which was net of $36.4 million of assumed mortgage debt and $13.3 million of financing obtained by Columbia.

The Company co-invests with the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (“CalSTRS”) in a joint venture (“RegCal”) in which the
Company has an ownership interest of 25%. As of December 31, 2007, RegCal owned eight shopping centers, had total assets of $167.3 million and net income of $2.8 million for the year then ended of which the Company’s share of the
venture’s total assets and net income was $41.8 million and $662,217, respectively. During 2007, CalSTRS sold one shopping center to an unrelated party for $13.2 million for a gain of $1.4 million. During 2006, RegCal acquired two shopping
centers from unrelated parties for a purchase price of $37.3 million. The Company contributed $4.1 million for its proportionate share of the purchase price, which was net of financing obtained by RegCal.

The Company co-invests with Macquarie CountryWide Trust of Australia (“MCW”) in five joint ventures, two in which the Company has an ownership interest
of 25% (collectively, “MCWR I”), two in which it has an ownership interest of 24.95% (collectively, “MCWR II”), and one in which it has an ownership interest of 16.35% (“MCWR-DESCO”).

As of December 31, 2007, MCWR I owned 42 shopping centers, had total assets of $612.0 million, and net income of $32.7 million for the year then ended of
which the Company’s share of the venture’s total assets and net income was $153.1 million and $10.3 million, respectively. During 2007, MCWR I purchased one shopping center from a third party for $23.0 million, net of $10.8 million of
assumed mortgage debt, and the Company contributed $2.2 million for its pro-rata share of the purchase price. During 2007, MCWR I sold nine shopping centers to unrelated parties for $137.4 million for a gain of $22.6 million. During 2006 MCWR I
purchased one shopping center from a third party for $25.0 million. The Company contributed $748,466 for its proportionate share of the purchase price, which was net of $12.5 million of assumed mortgage debt and $10.4 million in 1031 proceeds.
During 2006, MCWR I sold two shopping centers to unrelated parties for $28.0 million for a gain of $7.8 million.

On June 1, 2005, MCWR II
closed on the acquisition of a retail shopping center portfolio (the “First Washington Portfolio”) for a purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion, including the assumption of approximately $68.6 million of mortgage debt and the
issuance of approximately $1.6 billion of new mortgage loans on the properties acquired. The First Washington Portfolio acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination by MCWR II. At December 31, 2005, MCWR II was owned 64.95%
by an affiliate of MCW, 34.95% by Regency and 0.1% by Macquarie-Regency Management, LLC (“US Manager”). US Manager is owned 50% by Regency and 50% by an affiliate of Macquarie Bank Limited. On January 13, 2006, the Company sold a
portion of its investment in MCWR II to MCW which reduced its ownership interest from 35% to 24.95% for net cash of $113.2 million which is reflected in proceeds from sale of real estate investments in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The
proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the unsecured line of credit.

Regency has the ability to receive additional acquisition fees of approximately $5.2 million (the
“Contingent Acquisition Fees”) deferred from the original acquisition date that are subject to achieving cumulative targeted income levels through 2008. The Contingent Acquisition Fees will only be recognized if earned, and the recognition
of income will be limited to that percentage of MCWR II, or 75.05%, of the joint venture not owned by the Company.

As of December 31, 2007,
MCWR II owned 96 shopping centers, had total assets of $2.6 billion and recorded a net loss of $13.1 million for the year ended and the Company’s share of the venture’s total assets and net loss was $651.0 million and $3.2 million,
respectively. As a result of the significant amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded by MCWR II in connection with the acquisition of the First Washington Portfolio, the joint venture may continue to report a net loss in future
years, but is expected to produce positive cash flow from operations. During 2007, MCWR II sold one shopping center to an unrelated party for $13.5 million and recognized a gain of $560,169. During 2006, MCWR II acquired four development properties
from the Company for a net sales price of $62.4 million and Regency received cash of $58.4 million. During 2006, MCWR II sold eight shopping centers for $122.4 million to unrelated parties for a gain of $1.5 million.

On August 10, 2007, MCWR-DESCO closed on the acquisition of 32 retail centers for a purchase price of approximately $396.2 million including debt of
approximately $209.5 million. The Company contributed $29.7 million to the venture for its pro-rata share of the purchase price for its 16.35% equity ownership. MCWR-DESCO had total assets of $419.9 million and a net loss of $3.3 million since
inception, primarily related to depreciation and amortization expense. The Company’s share of the venture’s total assets and net loss was $68.7 million and $465,028, respectively.

In December 2006, Regency formed Regency Retail Partners (the “Fund”), an open-end, infinite-life investment fund in which its ownership interest was
26.8%. During the first quarter, the Company reduced its ownership interest to 20% with the admission of additional partners into the Fund and recognized a gain of $2.2 million that had previously been deferred. The Fund has the exclusive right to
acquire all Regency-developed large format community centers upon stabilization that meet the Fund’s investment criteria. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund owned seven shopping centers, had total assets of $209.0 million and recorded net
income of $1.2 million for the year ended of which the Company’s share of the venture’s total assets and net income was $41.7 million and $325,861, respectively. During 2007, the Fund acquired six community shopping centers from the
Company for a sales price of $126.4 million or $102.8 million on a net basis. As part of the transaction the Company provided a short-term note receivable to the Fund of $12.1 million, which the Fund repaid in January 2008. The Company recognized a
gain of $42.8 million after excluding its ownership interest.

Recognition of gains from sales to joint ventures is recorded on only that portion of
the sales not attributable to the Company’s ownership interest. The gains, operations and cash flows are not recorded as discontinued operations because of Regency’s substantial continuing involvement in these shopping centers. Columbia,
RegCal, and the joint ventures with MCW and the Fund intend to continue to acquire retail shopping centers, some of which they may acquire directly from the Company. For those properties acquired from third parties, the Company is required to
contribute its pro-rata share of the purchase price to the joint ventures.

The revenues and expenses for the unconsolidated investments on a combined basis for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 are summarized as follows (in thousands):

5. Notes Receivable

The Company has notes receivable outstanding of $44.5 million and $20.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The notes bear interest ranging from LIBOR plus 175 basis points to 8.50% with maturity dates through November
2014. Of the $44.5 million notes receivable outstanding as of December 31, 2007, $12.1 million was outstanding to the “Fund” in which the Company owns 20%. The loan was provided to the Fund in order to facilitate the Company’s
sale of a shopping center to the Fund during December 2007. The loan represented 60% of the sales price of the shopping center sold and the Fund was in receipt of a permanent loan commitment from a third party lender at the sale date. On
January 28, 2008, the Fund repaid the note in full.

6. Acquired Lease Intangibles

The Company has acquired lease intangible assets of $17.2 million and $12.3 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, of which $16.7 million and $11.7
million, respectively relates to in-place leases. These in-place leases have a remaining weighted average amortization period of 7.5 years and the aggregate amortization expense recorded for these in-place leases was $4.3 million, $3.8 million, and
$4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The Company has above-market lease intangible assets of $554,849 and $623,130 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The remaining weighted average amortization
period is 5.3 years and the aggregate amortization expense recorded as a reduction to minimum rent for these above-market leases was $114,623 and $81,753 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company has acquired lease intangible liabilities of $10.4 million and $7.7 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The remaining weighted
average accretion period is 8.2 years and the aggregate amount accreted as an increase to minimum rent for these below-market rents was $2.0 million, $1.5 million, and $953,964 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The estimated aggregate amortization and net accretion amounts from acquired lease intangibles for each of the
next five years are as follows (in thousands):

7. Notes Payable and Unsecured Line of Credit

The Company’s outstanding debt at December 31, 2007 and 2006 consists of the following (in thousands):

On June 5, 2007, RCLP completed the sale of $400.0 million of ten-year senior unsecured notes. The
5.875% notes are due June 15, 2017 and were priced at 99.527% to yield 5.938%. The net proceeds were used to reduce the unsecured line of credit (the “Line”).

On February 12, 2007, Regency entered into a new loan agreement under the Line with a commitment of $600.0 million and the right to expand the Line by an
additional $150.0 million subject to additional lender syndication. The Line has a four-year term which expires in 2011 with a one-year extension at the Company’s option and the interest rate was reduced to LIBOR plus .55%. Contractual interest
rates were 5.425% at December 31, 2007 and 6.125% at December 31, 2006 based on LIBOR plus .55% and .75%, respectively. The balance on the Line was $208.0 million and $121.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
spread paid on the Line is dependent upon the Company maintaining specific investment-grade ratings.

On December 5, 2007, Standard and
Poor’s Rating Services raised Regency’s corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings to BBB+ from BBB. As a result of this upgrade, the interest rate on the Line was reduced to LIBOR plus .40% effective January 1, 2008.

The Company is also required to comply, and is in compliance, with certain financial covenants such as Minimum Net Worth, Total Liabilities to Gross Asset Value
(“GAV”) and Recourse Secured Debt to GAV, Fixed Charge Coverage, and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing. The Line is used primarily to finance the acquisition and development of real estate, but is also
available for general working-capital purposes.

Mortgage loans are secured and may be prepaid, but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums.
Mortgage loans are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest, and mature over various terms through 2018.

7. Notes Payable and Unsecured Line of Credit (Continued)

We intend to repay mortgage loans at maturity from proceeds from the Line. Fixed interest rates on mortgage loans range from 5.22% to 8.95% and average 6.37%. The
Company has one variable rate mortgage loan with an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 100 basis points.

The fair value of the
Company’s variable rate notes payable and the Line are considered to approximate fair value, since the interest rates on such instruments re-price based on current market conditions. The fair value of fixed rate loans are estimated using cash
flows discounted at current market rates available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities. Fixed rate loans assumed in connection with real estate acquisitions are recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at
fair value. Based on the estimates used by the Company, the fair value of notes payable and the Line is approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, scheduled principal repayments on notes payable and the Line were as follows (in thousands):

On February 26, 2008, the Company was notified by Wells Fargo Bank that they had received commitments
from a group of banks, which in combination with their commitment will provide the Company with an estimated $341.5 million, three-year term loan facility (the “Term Facility”). The Term Facility will include a term loan amount of $227.7
million that will fund at closing plus a $113.8 million revolver component that is accessible by the Company at its discretion. The Term Facility will be subject to similar loan covenants that are contained within the Line and the Company’s
other unsecured fixed rate loans. The term loan has a variable interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 105 basis points, and the revolver has a variable interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 110 basis points, both of which are subject to the Company’s
current debt ratings. The Term Facility does not affect our existing $600.0 million Line commitment. The proceeds from the funding of the Term Facility will be used for general working capital purposes including the reduction of any debt balances,
at our discretion. The Term Facility is expected to close during March 2008 subject to final terms and conditions.

8. Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to interest rate risks. In order to manage the volatility relating to
interest rate risk, the Company may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. None of the Company’s derivatives are designated as fair value hedges and the Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes.

On March 10, 2006, the Company entered into four forward-starting interest rate swaps totaling $396.7 million
with fixed rates of 5.399%, 5.415%, 5.399%, and 5.415%. The Company designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to fix $400 million fixed rate financing expected to occur in 2010 and 2011. The change in fair value of these swaps from inception
generated a liability of $9.8 million and $2.9 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

December 31, 2007

8. Derivative Financial Instruments (Continued)

On April 1, 2005, the Company entered into three forward-starting interest rate swaps totaling $196.7
million with fixed rates of 5.029%, 5.05%, and 5.05% to fix the rate on unsecured notes issued in July 2005. On July 13, 2005, the Company settled the swaps with a payment to the counter-parties for $7.3 million. During 2003, the Company
entered into two forward-starting interest rate swaps totaling $144.2 million to fix the rate on a refinancing in April 2004. On March 31, 2004, the Company settled these swaps with a payment to the counter-party for $5.7 million. The
adjustment to interest expense recorded in 2007, 2006 and 2005 related to the settlement of these swaps is $1.3 million, $1.3 million and $908,311. The unamortized balance at December 31, 2007 is $9.1 million.

All of these swaps qualify for hedge accounting under Statement 133. Realized losses associated with the swaps settled in 2005 and 2004 and unrealized gains or
losses associated with the swaps entered into in 2006 have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss). The unamortized balance of the
realized losses is being amortized as additional interest expense over the ten year terms of the hedged loans. Unrealized gains or losses will not be amortized until such time that the expected debt issuance is completed in 2010 and 2011 as long as
the swaps continue to qualify for hedge accounting.

9. Stockholders’ Equity and Minority Interest

(a) Preferred Units

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the face value of the
Series D Preferred Units was $50.0 million with a fixed distribution rate of 7.45% and recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets net of original issuance costs.

Terms and conditions for the Series D Preferred Units outstanding as of December 31, 2007 are summarized as follows:

(b) Preferred Stock (Continued)

In 2005, the Company issued three million shares, or $75.0 million, of 6.70% Series 5 Preferred Stock with a
liquidation preference of $25 per share of which the proceeds were used to reduce the balance of the Line. The Series 3 and 4 depositary shares, which have a liquidation preference of $25, and the Series 5 preferred shares are perpetual, are not
convertible into common stock of the Company, and are redeemable at par upon Regency’s election five years after the issuance date. None of the terms of the Preferred Stock contain any unconditional obligations that would require the Company to
redeem the securities at any time or for any purpose.

On January 1, 2008, the Company split each share of existing Series 3 and Series 4
Preferred Stock, each having a liquidation preference of $250 per share, and a redemption price of $250 per share into ten shares of Series 3 and Series 4 Stock, respectively, each having a liquidation preference of $25 per share and a redemption
price of $25 per share. The Company then exchanged each Series 3 and 4 Depository Share into shares of New Series 3 and 4 Stock, respectively, which have the same dividend rights and other rights and preferences identical to the depositary shares.

(c) Common Stock

On April 5, 2005, the Company entered into
an agreement to sell 4,312,500 shares of its common stock to an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (“Citigroup”) at $46.60 per share, in connection with a forward sale agreement (the “Forward Sale Agreement”). On
August 1, 2005, the Company issued 3,782,500 shares to Citigroup for net proceeds of approximately $175.5 million and on September 7, 2005, the remaining 530,000 shares were issued for net proceeds of $24.4 million. The proceeds from the
sales were used to reduce the Line and redeem the Series E and Series F Preferred Units.

10. Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recorded stock-based compensation in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operation for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 as follows, the components of which are further described below (in thousands):

The recorded amounts of stock-based compensation expense represent amortization of deferred compensation
related to share based payments in accordance with Statement 123(R). During the three years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 compensation expense of $7.6 million, $6.9 million, and $6.9 million, respectively which is included above,
specifically identifiable to development and leasing activities was capitalized.

The Company established the Plan under which the Board of Directors
may grant stock options and other stock-based awards to officers, directors, and other key employees. The Plan allows the Company to issue up to 5.0 million shares in the form of common stock or stock options, but limits the issuance of common
stock excluding stock options to no more than 2.75 million shares. At December 31, 2007, there were approximately 2.4 million shares available for grant under the Plan either through options or restricted stock. The Plan also limits
outstanding awards to no more than 12% of outstanding common stock.

10. Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

Stock options are granted under the Plan with an exercise price equal to the stock’s price at the date of
grant. All stock options granted have ten-year lives, contain vesting terms of one to five years from the date of grant and some have dividend equivalent rights. Stock options granted prior to 2005 also contained “reload” rights, which
allowed an option holder the right to receive new options each time existing options were exercised if the existing options were exercised under specific criteria provided for in the Plan. In January 2005, the Company acquired the “reload”
rights of existing employees’ stock options from the option holders by granting 771,645 options for an exercise price of $51.36, the fair value on the date of grant, and granted 7,906 restricted shares representing value of $363,664,
substantially canceling all of the “reload” rights on existing stock options. In March 2007, the Company acquired the “reload” rights of existing directors’ stock options from the option holders by granting 13,353 options
for an average exercise price of $89.95, the fair value on the date of grant, and granted 1,654 restricted shares representing value of $148,725, therefore canceling all of their “reload” rights. These stock options and restricted shares
vest 25% per year and are expensed ratably over a four-year period beginning in year of grant in accordance with Statement 123(R). Options granted under the reload buy-out plan do not earn dividend equivalents.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton closed-form (“Black Scholes”) option valuation model
that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data and other factors to estimate option exercises and
employee terminations within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate
for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The Company believes
that the use of the Black-Scholes model meets the fair value measurement objectives of Statement 123(R) and reflects all substantive characteristics of the instruments being valued. The following table represents the assumptions used for the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model for options granted in the respective year:

10. Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
$20.2 million, $17.3 million, and $7.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, there was $1.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted under the Plan expected to be recognized through 2008.
The Company received cash proceeds for stock option exercises of $2.4 million, $6.0 million, and $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively The Company issues new shares to fulfill option exercises from its
authorized shares available.

The following table presents information regarding unvested option activity during the period ended December 31,
2007:

The Company grants restricted stock under the Plan to its employees as a form of long-term compensation and
retention. The terms of each grant vary depending upon the participant’s responsibilities and position within the Company. The Company’s stock grants to date can be categorized into three types: (a) 4-year vesting,
(b) performance-based vesting, and (c) 8-year cliff vesting.

•

The 4-year vesting grants vest 25% per year beginning in the year of grant. These grants are not subject to future performance measures, and if such performance criteria
are not met, the compensation cost previously recognized would be reversed.

•

Performance-based vesting grants are earned subject to future performance measurements, which include individual performance measures, annual growth in earnings, compounded
three-year growth in earnings, and a three-year total shareholder return peer comparison (“TSR Grant”). Once the performance criteria are met and the actual number of shares earned is determined, certain shares will vest immediately while
others will vest over an additional service period.

•

The 8-year cliff vesting grants fully vest at the end of the eighth year from the date of grant; however, as a result of the achievement of future performance, primarily
growth in earnings, the vesting of these grants may be accelerated over a shorter term.

Performance-based vesting grants and
8-year cliff vesting grants are currently only granted to the Company’s senior management. The Company considers the likelihood of meeting the performance criteria based upon management’s estimates and analysis of future earnings growth
from which it determines the amounts recognized as expense on a periodic basis. The Company determines the grant date fair value of TSR Grants based upon a Monte Carlo Simulation model. Compensation expense is measured at the grant date and
recognized over the vesting period.

10. Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

The following table reports restricted stock activity during the period ended December 31, 2007:

The weighted-average grant price for restricted stock granted during the years 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
$84.52, $63.75 and $51.38, respectively. The total intrinsic value of restricted stock vested during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $29.7 million, $26.3 million and $16.5 million, respectively. As of December 31,
2007, there was $21.7 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock granted under the Plan, which is recorded when recognized in additional paid in capital of the consolidated statements of stockholders’
equity and comprehensive income (loss). This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the next four years, through 2011. The Company issues new restricted stock from its authorized shares available.

The Company maintains a 401 (k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees, which permits participants to defer up to the maximum allowable amount
determined by the IRS of their eligible compensation. This deferred compensation, together with Company matching contributions equal to 100% of employee deferrals up to a maximum of $3,500 of their eligible compensation, is fully vested and funded
as of December 31, 2007. Costs related to the matching portion of the plan were approximately $1.3 million, $1.1 million, and $603,415 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The exchangeable operating partnership units were anti-dilutive to diluted EPS for the three years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 and therefore, the units and the related minority interest of exchangeable operating partnership units are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.

12. Operating Leases

Future minimum rents under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2007, excluding both tenant reimbursements of operating expenses and additional percentage rent based on tenants’ sales volume, are as follows (in
thousands):

The shopping centers’ tenant base includes primarily national and regional supermarkets, drug stores,
discount department stores and other retailers and, consequently, the credit risk is concentrated in the retail industry. There were no tenants that individually represented more than 6% of the Company’s annualized future minimum rents.

The Company has shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying
land to Regency to construct and/or operate a shopping center. In addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which it conducts its business. Leasehold improvements are capitalized, recorded as tenant
improvements, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term. The following table summarizes the future obligations under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands):

13. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is involved in litigation on a number of matters and is subject to certain claims which arise in the normal course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. The Company is also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to real estate pertaining to chemicals used by the dry
cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks (UST’s). The Company believes that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with
current laws and regulations. The Company has placed environmental insurance, when possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate its environmental risk. The Company monitors the shopping centers containing
environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediates the sites. The Company

also has legal obligations to remediate certain sites and is in the process of doing so. The Company estimates the cost associated with these legal obligations to be
approximately $3.4 million, all of which has been reserved. The Company believes that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on its financial position, liquidity, or operations; however, it
can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to the shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not
known to it; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and
regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to the Company.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive
officer, chief operating officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K to ensure information required to be
disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer, chief operating officer and our chief financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued a report, included herein, on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

Regency’s system of internal control over financial reporting was designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. All internal control systems, no mater how well
designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Controls

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting
identified in connection with this evaluation that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 and that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.

Compensation Plan Information

(1)

The weighted average exercise price excludes stock rights awards, which we sometimes refer to as unvested restricted stock.

(2)

Our Long Term Omnibus Plan, as amended and approved by stockholders at our 2003 annual meeting, provides for the issuance of up to 5.0 million shares of common stock or stock options for
stock compensation; however, outstanding unvested grants plus vested but unexercised options cannot exceed 12% of our outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents (excluding options and other stock equivalents outstanding under the plan).
The plan permits the grant of any type of share-based award but limits restricted stock awards, stock rights awards, performance shares, dividend equivalents settled in stock and other forms of stock grants to 2.75 million shares, of which
940,466 shares were available at December 31, 2007 for future issuance.
