                                     PART I
Item 1.  Business

     Regency  Realty  Corporation  ("Regency"  or  "Company")  acquires,   owns,
develops and manages  neighborhood  shopping centers in targeted markets.  As of
December 31, 1999, Regency owned, directly or indirectly,  216 properties in the
United  States,  containing  approximately  24.8  million  square  feet of gross
leasable area ("GLA").

As  of  December  31,  1999,  Regency  had  an  investment  in  real  estate  of
approximately $2.6 billion.  Regency's shopping centers were approximately 92.4%
leased as of December 31, 1999.

On February  26,  1999,  Regency's  stockholders  approved the merger of Pacific
Retail Trust ("Pacific") into the Company in a stock for stock transaction (0.48
Regency  share for 1 Pacific  share).  At December  31, 1998,  Pacific  owned 71
retail shopping centers that were operating or under construction containing 8.4
million SF of GLA. The total cost to acquire Pacific was $1.157 billion based on
the  value  of  Regency  shares  issued,  the  assumption  of  $379  million  of
outstanding debt and other liabilities, and transaction costs.

The Company, a Florida corporation  organized in 1993, commenced operations as a
real estate  investment  trust (REIT) in 1993 with the completion of its initial
public  offering,  and was the  successor  to the real  estate  business  of The
Regency Group, Inc. which had operated since 1963.

Regency  formed  Regency  Centers,  L.P.  ("RCLP" or  "Partnership"),  a limited
partnership and a public registrant, in 1996, and consolidated substantially all
of its retail  shopping  centers into RCLP during 1999.  RCLP is now the primary
entity  through  which  Regency owns its  properties  and through  which Regency
intends to expand its  ownership and operation of retail  shopping  centers.  At
December 31, 1999,  Regency owned  approximately  97% of the outstanding  common
operating partnership units of RCLP. Regency, the general partner of RCLP, fully
controls the  operating  and investing  decisions  and  activities of RCLP,  and
accordingly,  the following  discussion of Regency's  business also includes the
business of RCLP.

See also footnote 3, Segments, to the consolidated financial statements included
herein, for a related discussion of the Company's business.

Operating and Investment Philosophy

Regency's  key  operating  and  investment  objective  is  to  create  long-term
shareholder value by:

     growing its high quality real estate portfolio of grocery-anchored
     neighborhood  shopping centers in attractive markets,

     maximizing  the  value of the  portfolio  through  its  "Retail  Operating
     System,"  which   incorporates   research  based   investment   strategies,
     value-added leasing and management systems, and customer-driven development
     programs, and

     using conservative  financial management and Regency's substantial capital
     base to access the most cost effective capital to fund Regency's growth.

Grocery-Anchored Strategy

Regency  focuses  its  investment  strategy  on  grocery-anchored   neighborhood
shopping centers which are located in infill locations or high growth corridors.
Infill  locations  are situated in densely  populated  residential  communities
where  there are  significant  barriers to entry,  such as zoning  restrictions,
growth  management  laws or limited  availability  of sites for  development  or
expansions.  Regency  is focused on  building  a  platform  of  grocery-anchored
neighborhood   shopping  centers  because  grocery  stores  provide  convenience
shopping for daily  necessities,  generate foot traffic for adjacent "side shop"
tenants and should be better able to withstand adverse economic  conditions.  By
marketing to leading  supermarket  chains,  Regency  believes it can attract the
best "side shop" merchants and enhance revenue potential.


Research Driven Market Selection

Regency targets  specific markets in the United States that offer greater growth
in population,  household income and employment than the national  averages.  In
addition,  Regency believes that it can achieve "critical mass" in these markets
(defined as owning or managing 4 to 5 shopping centers) and that it can generate
sustainable competitive advantages,  through long-term leases to the predominant
grocery-anchor  and other  barriers  to entry  from  competition.  Within  these
markets,  Regency's  research and investment  staff further  defines and selects
submarkets and trade areas based on additional  analysis of the above data. This
research is used to support either the  acquisiton or  development  decision and
assist in the leasing of major and local tenant space.

Retail Operating System

Regency's  Retail Operating System drives its value-added  operating  strategy.
Its Retail Operating System is characterized
by:

      proactive leasing and management;

      value enhancing remerchandising initiatives;

      Regency's "preferred customer initiative"; and

      a customer-driven development and redevelopment program.

Proactive leasing and management
Regency's  integrated  approach to asset management  strengthens its leasing and
management efforts.  Asset managers are an integral component of the acquisition
and development  teams.  Asset managers are responsible not only for the general
operations of their centers, but also for coordinating leasing efforts,  thereby
aligning their  interests with  Regency's.  In addition,  Regency's  information
systems  allow  managers to spot future  lease  expirations  and to  proactively
market and remerchandise spaces several years in advance of such expirations.

Value enhancing remerchandising initiatives
Regency  believes that certain  shopping  centers  under-serve  their customers,
reducing  foot  traffic and  negatively  affecting  the  tenants  located in the
shopping center. In response,  Regency has a remerchandising program directed at
obtaining  the optimum mix of tenants  offering  goods,  personal  services  and
entertainment  and  dining  options  in  each  of  its  shopping   centers.   By
re-tenanting  shopping  centers with tenants that more  effectively  service the
community,  Regency  expects to increase  sales,  and therefore the value of its
shopping centers.

Preferred customer initiative
Regency  is  implementing  the  "Preferred  Customer  Initiative"  to enable the
Company to profit from the platform's  national and individual  market  strength
and to enhance internal growth. The "Preferred Customer Initiative" is Regency's
relationship  based  operating  system  that  focuses on national  and  regional
retailers that are the best operators in their  merchandising  categories.  With
this  customer  focused  operating  system that is  augmented  by  merchandising
research,  the Company is in a unique position to continue to attract and better
serve strong  retailers by offering  multiple  leasing  opportunities in centers
that have the anchors and demographics that drive retail sales. The Company also
serves the tenants by creating standard lease forms.  Regency's  objective is to
create a brand with our tenant  customers as the preferred  neighborhood  center
operator  and  developer.  Management  expects  the  benefits  of the  preferred
customer initiative to improve the merchandising and performance of the shopping
centers, establish brand recognition among leading operators, reduce turnover of
tenants and reduce vacancies.

Customer-driven development and redevelopment program
Regency conducts its development and redevelopment  program in close cooperation
with  its  major  grocery  customers  including  Kroger,  Publix,  Safeway,  and
Albertsons.  Regency uses its development capabilities to service its customer's
growth needs by building or  re-developing  modern  properties with state of the
art  supermarket  formats that  generate  higher  returns for Regency  under new
long-term  leases.  Regency's  developments are customer driven with an executed
lease from the anchor  typically  in hand prior to  purchase  of the land.  As a
result of the anchor  commitment and Regency's  relationship with key, side shop
neighborhood  retailers,  a significant  percentage of the GLA is  pre-committed
before commencement of construction.


Capital Strategy

Regency intends to maintain a conservative capital structure designed to enhance
access to capital on favorable  terms,  to allow growth through  development and
acquisition  and to promote future  earnings  growth.  Regency's  organizational
documents  do not  limit  the  amount  of debt  that may be  incurred;  however,
limitations  have  been  established   within  the  covenants  of  certain  loan
agreements  related to RCLP's  unsecured  acquisition  and  development  line of
credit (the "Line') and medium term notes.

Regency's strategy to add shareholder value is designed to enable the Company to
profit from the anomaly  between low current  pricing for public  equity and the
attractive  private  market  valuations of quality  neighborhood  centers and to
increase returns on invested capital by leveraging  Regency's core competencies.
Asset  optimization  will  enable  Regency to recycle  capital  from the sale of
developments at low cap rates and dispositions of properties with limited growth
prospects in the private market at attractive  valuations.  The proceeds will be
used to finance new  development of shopping  centers and repurchases of Regency
common stock at attractive yields.

Regency is actively pursuing a joint venture structure to leverage the Company's
expertise and the quality of the operating properties and development  pipeline.
Value would be realized by contributing  centers and selling developments to the
venture at private market pricing.  The joint venture  structure will contribute
to cost effectively  financing Regency's  development program,  allow Regency to
recognize  profits from sales and expand the shopping  center  platform.  All of
these actions are expected to lead to higher  returns on the Company's  invested
capital.

Risk Factors Relating to Ownership of Regency Common Stock

The Company is subject to certain  business  risks  arising in  connection  with
owning real estate which include, among others:

     the bankruptcy or insolvency of, or a downturn in the business of, any of
     its major tenants could reduce cash flow,

     the  possibility  that such  tenants  will not renew their  leases as they
     expire or renew at lower rental rates could reduce cash flow,

     risks related to the internet and e-commerce reducing the demand for
     shopping centers,

     vacated anchor space will affect the entire shopping center because of the
     loss of the departed anchor tenant's customer drawing power,

     poor market conditions could create an over supply of space or a reduction
     in demand  for real  estate in  markets  where the  Company  owns  shopping
     centers,

     the Company's rapid growth could place strains on its resources,

     risks relating to leverage, including uncertainty that the Company will be
     able to refinance its indebtedness, and the risk of higher interest rates,

     unsuccessful development activities could reduce cash flow,

     the Company's  inability to satisfy its cash  requirements  for operations
     and the  possibility  that the Company  may be required to borrow  funds to
     meet distribution  requirements in order to maintain its qualification as a
     REIT,

     potential liability for unknown or future environmental matters and costs
     of compliance with the Americans  with Disabilities Act,

     the risk of uninsured losses, and

     unfavorable  economic  conditions  could also result in the  inability  of
     tenants in certain  retail  sectors to meet  their  lease  obligations  and
     otherwise  could  adversely  affect the  Company's  ability to attract  and
     retain desirable tenants.

Compliance with Governmental Regulations

Under various  federal,  state and local laws,  ordinances and  regulations,  an
owner or  manager  of real  estate  may be liable  for the costs of  removal  or
remediation of certain  hazardous or toxic  substances on such  property.  These
laws often impose liability  without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was
responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  The cost of
required  remediation and the owner's liability for remediation could exceed the
value of the property and/or the aggregate  assets of the owner. The presence of
such  substances,  or the failure to properly  remediate  such  substances,  may
adversely  affect the  owner's  ability to sell or rent the  property  or borrow
using the property as collateral.  Regency has a number of properties  that will
require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation.
These  remediations are not expected to have a material  financial effect on the
Company due to financial statement reserves and various state-regulated programs
that shift the responsibility and cost for remediation to the state.


Competition

The Company  believes the  ownership of shopping  centers is highly  fragmented,
with less than 10% owned by REITs. Regency faces competition from other REITs in
the  acquisition,  ownership  and  leasing of  shopping  centers as well as from
numerous small owners.  Regency competes for the development of shopping centers
with  other  REITs  engaged in  development  activities  as well as with  local,
regional and national real estate  developers.  Regency  develops  properties by
applying its proprietary  research  methods to identify  development and leasing
opportunities  and  by  significantly  pre-leasing  development  centers  before
beginning  construction.  Regency  competes for the  acquisition  of  properties
through proprietary research that identifies  opportunities in markets with high
barriers  to entry  and  higher-than-average  population  growth  and  household
income.  Regency  seeks  to  maximize  rents  per  square  foot by  establishing
relationships  with supermarket chains that are first or second in their markets
and  leasing  non-anchor  space in  multiple  centers to  national  or  regional
tenants.  There can be no assurance,  however,  that other real estate owners or
developers will not utilize similar research methods and target the same markets
and anchor tenants that Regency targets or that such entities will  successfully
control these markets and tenants to the exclusion of Regency.

Changes in Policies

The  Company's  Board of Directors  determines  policies with respect to certain
activities,  including  its debt  capitalization,  growth,  distributions,  REIT
status,  and  investment  and operating  strategies.  The Board of Directors may
amend these policies at any time without a vote of the Company's shareholders.

Employees

The Company's  headquarters  are located in Jacksonville,  Florida.  The Company
presently  maintains  16  offices  in 10 states  where it  conducts  management,
leasing and  development  activities.  As of December 31, 1999,  the Company had
approximately  342 employees and believes that  relations with its employees are
good.





The  following  table  summarizes  the largest  tenants  occupying the Company's
shopping centers based upon a percentage of total annualized base rent exceeding
 .5% at December 31, 1999.  The table  includes 100% of the base rent from leases
of  properties  owned by joint  ventures.  Excluding the portion of base rent of
joint  ventures  not owned by the Company,  Kroger's  percentage  of  annualized
Company base rent is 8.96%.



The Company's leases have lease terms generally ranging from three to five years
for tenant space under 5,000 square feet. Leases greater than 10,000 square feet
generally have lease terms in excess of five years,  mostly  comprised of anchor
tenants.  Many of the anchor leases contain  provisions  allowing the tenant the
option of extending the term of the lease at  expiration.  The Company's  leases
provide for the monthly payment in advance of fixed minimum rentals,  additional
rents  calculated as a percentage of the tenant's  sales,  the tenant's pro rata
share of real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance expenses, and
reimbursement  for utility costs if not directly  metered.  The following  table
sets forth a schedule of lease expirations for the next ten years, assuming that
no tenants exercise renewal options:

Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Shareholder
        Matters

The  Company's  common stock is traded on the New York Stock  Exchange  ("NYSE")
under  the  symbol  "REG".  The  Company  currently  has   approximately   3,500
shareholders.  The  following  table  sets forth the high and low prices and the
cash  dividends  declared on the Company's  common stock by quarter for 1999 and
1998.


The following describes the registrant's sales of unregistered securities during
the  periods  covered by this  report,  each sold in reliance on Rule 506 of the
Securities Act.

The  Company  intends  to pay  regular  quarterly  distributions  to its  common
stockholders.  Future  distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion
of the Board of  Directors,  and will depend upon cash  generated  by  operating
activities,  the Company's financial  condition,  capital  requirements,  annual
distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986,  as amended,  and such other  factors as the Board of  Directors  deems
relevant.  The  Company  anticipates  that  for  the  foreseeable  future,  cash
available  for  distribution  will be greater  than  earnings and profits due to
non-cash expenses,  primarily  depreciation and amortization,  to be incurred by
the  Company.  Distributions  by the  Company to the extent of its  current  and
accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes will be taxable
to stockholders as ordinary dividend income. Distributions in excess of earnings
and profits generally will be treated as a non-taxable  return of capital.  Such
distributions  have  the  effect  of  deferring  taxation  until  the  sale of a
stockholder's  common stock. In order to maintain its  qualification  as a REIT,
the Company must make annual  distributions  to  stockholders of at least 95% of
its taxable income (90% effective January 1, 2001). Under certain circumstances,
which management does not expect to occur, the Company could be required to make
distributions  in excess of cash  available for  distributions  in order to meet
such   requirements.   The  Company  currently   maintains  the  Regency  Realty
Corporation  Dividend  Reinvestment  and Stock  Purchase  Plan which enables its
stockholders to automatically reinvest distributions, as well as, make voluntary
cash payments towards the purchase of additional shares.


Under the loan  agreement  with the  lenders  of the  Company's  line of credit,
distributions  may not exceed 95% of Funds from Operations  ("FFO") based on the
immediately  preceding  four  quarters.  FFO is defined in  accordance  with the
NAREIT  definition  as  described  under Item 7.,  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis.  Also in the event of any monetary default,  the Company will not make
distributions to stockholders.

On  September  3, 1999,  the  Company  through  RCLP issued $85 million of 8.75%
Series B Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred Units ("Series B Preferred Units") to
an institutional investor in a private placement. The issuance involved the sale
of 850,000 Series B Preferred Units for $100.00 per unit. The Series B Preferred
Units,  which may be called by the  Partnership at par on or after  September 3,

2004,  have no stated  maturity or mandatory  redemption,  and pay a cumulative,
quarterly  dividend at an annualized rate of 9.125%. At any time after September
29, 2009,  the Series D Preferred  Units may be  exchanged  for shares of 9.125%

Item 6.  Selected Consolidated Financial Data
(in thousands, except per share data and number of properties)

The following table sets forth Selected Financial Data on a historical basis for
the five years ended December 31, 1999, for the Company. This information should
be read in conjunction with the financial  statements of the Company  (including
the related  notes  thereto)  and  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of the
Financial  Condition and Results of Operations,  each included elsewhere in this
Form 10-K.  This  historical  Selected  Financial Data has been derived from the
audited financial statements.







7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following  discussion  should be read in conjunction  with the  accompanying
Consolidated   Financial   Statements   and  Notes  thereto  of  Regency  Realty
Corporation ("Regency" or "Company") appearing elsewhere within.

Organization

The Company is a qualified  real estate  investment  trust  ("REIT") which began
operations in 1993.  The Company  invests in real estate  primarily  through its
general partnership interest in Regency Centers, L.P., ("RCLP" or "Partnership")
an operating  partnership in which the Company currently owns  approximately 97%
of the outstanding  common  partnership  units ("Units").  Of the 216 properties
included in the Company's  portfolio at December 31, 1999, 198  properties  were
owned either fee simple or through  partnership  interests by RCLP.  At December
31,  1999,  the  Company  had  an  investment  in  real  estate,   at  cost,  of
approximately $2.6 billion of which $2.4 billion or 96% was owned by RCLP.

Shopping Center Business

     The  Company's  principal  business  is owning,  operating  and  developing
grocery  anchored  neighborhood  shopping  centers  which are  located in infill
locations or high growth corridors. The Company's properties (both operating and
under  construction)  summarized  by  state  and in order  by  largest  holdings
including their gross leasable areas (GLA) follows: 


          * Excludes properties under construction


The Company is focused on building a platform of grocery  anchored  neighborhood
shopping  centers because grocery stores provide  convenience  shopping of daily
necessities,  foot  traffic for adjacent  local  tenants,  and should  withstand
adverse  economic  conditions.  The Company's  current  investment  markets have
continued to offer strong stable economies, and accordingly, the Company expects
to  realize  growth in net  income as a result of  increasing  occupancy  in the
portfolio,  increasing  rental rates,  development  and  acquisition of shopping
centers in targeted markets, and redevelopment of existing shopping centers. The
following  table  summarizes  the four largest  grocery  tenants  occupying  the
Company's shopping centers at December 31, 1999:




Acquisition and Development of Shopping Centers

On  September  23,  1998,  the  Company  entered  into an  Agreement  of  Merger
("Agreement")  with Pacific  Retail  Trust  ("Pacific"),  a privately  held real
estate  investment trust. The Agreement,  among other matters,  provided for the
merger of Pacific  into  Regency,  and the  exchange of each  Pacific  common or
preferred  share into 0.48  shares of Regency  common or  preferred  stock.  The
stockholders  approved  the  merger at a Special  Meeting of  Stockholders  held
February 26, 1999. At the time of the merger,  Pacific owned 71 retail  shopping
centers that were operating or under  construction  containing 8.4 million SF of
gross  leaseable  area. On February 28, 1999,  the effective date of the merger,
the Company  issued equity  instruments  valued at $770.6 million to the Pacific
stockholders in exchange for their  outstanding  common and preferred shares and
units. The total cost to acquire Pacific was approximately  $1.157 billion based
on the value of Regency shares issued,  including the assumption of $379 million
of outstanding  debt and other  liabilities of Pacific,  and closing costs.  The
price per share used to determine  the purchase  price was $23.325  based on the
five day average of the closing stock price of Regency's common stock on the New
York Stock Exchange  immediately before,  during and after the date the terms of
the merger were agreed to and announced to the public.  The merger was accounted
for as a purchase with the Company as the acquiring entity.

During 1998, the Company  acquired 43 shopping  centers and joint ventures for a
total investment of $384.3 million ("1998 Acquisitions").  With respect to these
acquisitions,  during 1999, the Company paid contingent  consideration valued at
$9.0 million  consisting of 69,555 Units, 3,768 shares of common stock, and $7.0
million.  During 2000, the Company may pay contingent  consideration of up to an
estimated $7.5 million,  through the issuance of Units, stock and the payment of
cash.

Results from Operations

Comparison 1999 to 1998

Revenues  increased  $158.6  million  or 111% to  $301.9  million  in 1999.  The
increase  was due  primarily  to  Pacific  and the 1998  Acquisitions  providing
increases in revenues of $143.9  million  during 1999. At December 31, 1999, the
real estate  portfolio  contained  approximately  24.8  million SF and was 92.4%
leased.  Minimum rent increased  $114.7  million or 111%,  and  recoveries  from
tenants  increased  $31.8 million or 132%. On a same property  basis  (excluding
Pacific, the 1998 Acquisitions, and the office portfolio sold during 1998) gross
rental  revenues  increased  $8.9  million or 8%,  primarily  due to higher base
rents. Other non-rental revenues from property management,  leasing,  brokerage,
and development  services (service operation segment) provided on properties not
owned by the  Company  were $18.2  million  and $11.9  million in 1999 and 1998,
respectively.  This  increase of $6.3  million was the result of higher gains on
developments  sold.  During 1998,  the Company sold four office  buildings and a
parcel of land for $30.7  million,  and  recognized  a gain on the sale of $10.7
million.  As a result of these  transactions the Company's real estate portfolio
is comprised  entirely of retail  shopping  centers.  The proceeds from the sale
were used to reduce the balance of the  unsecured  acquisition  and  development
line of credit (the "Line").


Operating  expenses  increased  $64.9 million or 91% to $135.8  million in 1999.
Combined  operating  and  maintenance,  and real estate  taxes  increased  $36.6
million or 118% during 1999 to $67.5  million.  The increases are due to Pacific
and the 1998 Acquisitions generating operating and maintenance expenses and real
estate tax  increases of $35.9 million  during 1999.  On a same property  basis,
operating and maintenance  expenses and real estate taxes increased  $879,000 or
3.4%.  General and  administrative  expenses  increased 32% during 1999 to $19.3
million due to the hiring of new employees and related office expenses necessary
to manage the shopping centers  acquired during 1999 and 1998.  Depreciation and
amortization increased $23.6 million during 1999 or 94% primarily due to Pacific
and the 1998 Acquisitions.

Interest  expense  increased to $60.1 million in 1999 from $28.8 million in 1998
or 109% due to  increased  average  outstanding  loan  balances  related  to the
financing  of the 1998  Acquisitions  on the Line,  the  assumption  of debt for
Pacific and the debt  offerings  completed in 1999.  Weighted  average  interest
rates decreased .05% during 1999. See further  discussion under  Acquisition and
Development of Shopping Centers and Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Net income for common  stockholders  was $87.6 million in 1999 vs. $50.6 million
in 1998,  a $37 million or 73% increase  for the reasons  previously  described.
Diluted  earnings  per  share in 1999  was  $1.61  vs.  $1.75 in 1998 due to the
increase  in net income  offset by the  dilutive  impact  from the  increase  in
weighted average common shares and equivalents of 28.6 million  primarily due to
the acquisition of Pacific.

Comparison of 1998 to 1997

Revenues  increased $46.0 million or 47% to $143.3 million in 1998. The increase
was due  primarily  to the 1998 and 1997  Acquisitions  providing  increases  in
revenues of $37.5  million  during 1998.  At December 31, 1998,  the real estate
portfolio contained  approximately 14.7 million SF and was 92.9% leased. Minimum
rent increased $33.3 million or 47%, and recoveries from tenants  increased $7.5
million  or  45%.  On a  same  property  basis  (excluding  the  1998  and  1997
Acquisitions,  and the office  portfolio sold during 1998) gross rental revenues
increased  $3.4  million or 6.7%,  primarily  due to higher  base  rents.  Other
non-rental  revenues  from  property   management,   leasing,   brokerage,   and
development  services  (service  operation  segment)  provided on properties not
owned by the Company  were $11.9  million in 1998  compared  to $8.4  million in
1997,  the increase due  primarily to  increased  brokerage  fees and  increased
activity in construction  and  development  for third parties.  During 1998, the
Company sold four office  buildings and a parcel of land for $30.7 million,  and
recognized  a  gain  on  the  sale  of  $10.7  million.  As a  result  of  these
transactions the Company's real estate portfolio is comprised entirely of retail
shopping centers.  The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the balance of
the line of credit.

Operating  expenses  increased  $21.8  million or 44% to $71.0  million in 1998.
Combined operating and maintenance, and real estate taxes increased $7.9 million
or 35% during 1998 to $30.8 million.  The increases are due to the 1998 and 1997
Acquisitions  generating  operating and maintenance expenses and real estate tax
increases  of $9.4  million  during  1998,  partially  offset by the sale of the
office buildings.  On a same property basis,  operating and maintenance expenses
and real  estate  taxes  increased  $100,000 or 1%.  General and  administrative
expenses  increased  51% during  1998 to $15.1  million due to the hiring of new
employees and related office expenses  necessary to manage the shopping  centers
acquired  during  1998 and 1997,  as well as, the  shopping  centers the Company
began  managing  for  third  parties  during  1998 and  1997.  Depreciation  and
amortization increased $8.7 million during 1998 or 54% primarily due to the 1998
and 1997 Acquisitions.

Interest  expense  increased to $28.8 million in 1998 from $19.7 million in 1997
or 46%  due to  increased  average  outstanding  loan  balances  related  to the
financing of the 1998 and 1997  Acquisitions  on the Line and the  assumption of
debt.  Weighted  average  interest rates increased 0.1% during 1998. See further
discussion  under  Acquisition and Development of Shopping Centers and Liquidity
and Capital Resources.

Net income for common  stockholders  was $50.6 million in 1998 vs. $27.4 million
in 1997, a $23.2 million or 85% increase for the reasons  previously  described.
Diluted  earnings  per  share in 1998  was  $1.75  vs.  $1.23 in 1997 due to the
increase in net income  combined  with the dilutive  impact from the increase in
weighted  average common shares and equivalents of 7.2 million  primarily due to
the  acquisition  of Branch and Midland,  the issuance of shares to  SC-USREALTY
during 1998 and 1997, and the public offering completed in July, 1997.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Management  anticipates  that cash  generated  from  operating  activities  will
provide the necessary  funds on a short-term  basis for its operating  expenses,
interest expense and scheduled  principal payments on outstanding  indebtedness,
recurring  capital  expenditures  necessary  to properly  maintain  the shopping
centers,  and  distributions  to share and unit  holders.  Net cash  provided by
operating  activities  was $151.3  million and $65.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  The Company  incurred  recurring and
non-recurring  capital  expenditures   (non-recurring  expenditures  pertain  to
immediate   building   improvements  on  new   acquisitions  and  anchor  tenant
improvements  on new leases) of $21.5 million and $8.3 million,  during 1999 and
1998,  respectively.  The  Company  paid  scheduled  principal  payments of $6.1
million and $3.4 million  during 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  The Company paid
dividends and distributions of $113.1 million and $54.9 million, during 1999 and
1998, respectively, to its share and unit holders.

Management  expects  to meet  long-term  liquidity  requirements  for term  debt
payoffs  at  maturity,  non-recurring  capital  expenditures,  and  acquisition,
renovation and  development of shopping  centers from: (i) excess cash generated
from operating activities,  (ii) working capital reserves, (iii) additional debt
borrowings,  and (iv) additional  equity raised in the public markets.  Net cash
used in investing activities was $216.6 million and $236.4 million,  during 1999
and  1998,   respectively,   primarily  for  purposes   discussed   above  under
Acquisitions and Development of Shopping Centers. Net cash provided by financing
activities   was  $99.5  million  and  $174.7  million  during  1999  and  1998,
respectively, primarily related to the proceeds from the preferred unit and debt
offerings  completed during 1999 and 1998. At December 31, 1999, the Company had
50 shopping  centers or build to suit projects under  construction or undergoing
major renovations,  with costs to date of $271.3 million.  Total committed costs
necessary to complete the properties  under  development is estimated to be $135
million and will be expended through 2000.

During  1999,  the Board of Directors  authorized  the  repurchase  of up to $65
million of the Company's  outstanding  shares from time to time through periodic
open  market  transactions  or through  privately  negotiated  transactions.  At
December  31, 1999,  the Company had  repurchased  2.7 million  shares for $54.5
million.

The  Company's  outstanding  debt at December 31, 1999 and 1998  consists of the
following (in thousands):

During  February,  1999, the Company modified the terms of its unsecured line of
credit (the "Line") by increasing  the  commitment to $635 million.  This credit
agreement also provides for a competitive  bid facility of up to $250 million of
the  commitment  amount.  Maximum  availability  under  the Line is based on the
discounted value of a pool of eligible  unencumbered  assets  (determined on the
basis of  capitalized  net  operating  income) less the amount of the  Company's
outstanding unsecured liabilities. The Line matures in February 2001, but may be
extended annually for one year periods.  Borrowings under the Line bear interest
at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified  spread,  (1.00%  currently),
which is dependent on the  Company's  investment  grade  rating.  The Company is
required to comply,  and is in  compliance,  with  certain  financial  and other
covenants  customary  with this type of  unsecured  financing.  These  financial
covenants  include among others (i) maintenance of minimum net worth, (ii) ratio
of total liabilities to gross asset value,  (iii) ratio of secured  indebtedness
to gross asset  value,  (iv) ratio of EBITDA to interest  expense,  (v) ratio of
EBITDA  to debt  service  and  reserve  for  replacements,  and  (vi)  ratio  of
unencumbered net operating income to interest expense on unsecured indebtedness.
The Line is used primarily to finance the  acquisition  and  development of real
estate, but is also available for general working capital purposes.

Mortgage  loans are  secured  by  certain  real  estate  properties,  and may be
prepaid, but could be subject to a yield-maintenance premium. Mortgage loans are
generally due in monthly  installments of interest and principal and mature over
various  terms  through  2019.  Variable  interest  rates on mortgage  loans are
currently  based on LIBOR  plus a spread in a range of 125  basis  points to 150
basis points. Fixed interest rates on mortgage loans range from 7.04% to 9.8%.


During  1999,  the  Company  assumed  debt with a fair  value of $402.6  million
related to the acquisition of real estate,  which includes debt premiums of $4.1
million based upon the above market interest rates of the debt instruments. Debt
premiums are being amortized over the terms of the related debt instruments.

On April 15, 1999 the Company,  through RCLP, completed a $250 million unsecured
debt  offering in two tranches.  The Company  issued $200 million 7.4% notes due
April 1, 2004, priced at 99.922% to yield 7.42%, and $50 million 7.75% notes due
April 1, 2009,  priced at 100%.  The net proceeds of the  offering  were used to
reduce the balance of the Line.

As of December 31, 1999, scheduled principal repayments on notes payable and the
Line were as follows (in thousands):

Unconsolidated  partnerships  and joint  ventures had mortgage  loans payable of
$50.3  million at December 31, 1999,  and the Company's  proportionate  share of
these loans was $21.2 million.

The  Company  qualifies  and  intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the
Internal  Revenue  Code.  As a REIT,  the  Company is allowed to reduce  taxable
income  by  all  or  a  portion  of  its   distributions  to  stockholders.   As
distributions  have exceeded  taxable  income,  no provision for federal  income
taxes has been made.  While the Company  intends to continue to pay dividends to
its stockholders, it also will reserve such amounts of cash flow as it considers
necessary for the proper  maintenance and improvement of its real estate,  while
still maintaining its qualification as a REIT.

The Company's  real estate  portfolio has grown  substantially  during 1999 as a
result of the acquisitions and development  discussed above. The Company intends
to  continue to acquire and develop  shopping  centers in the near  future,  and
expects to meet the related  capital  requirements  from borrowings on the Line.
The Company expects to repay the Line from time to time from  additional  public
and private equity or debt offerings, such as those completed in previous years.
Because such acquisition and development activities are discretionary in nature,
they are not  expected  to burden  the  Company's  capital  resources  currently
available for liquidity requirements.  The Company expects that cash provided by
operating activities, unused amounts available under the Line, and cash reserves
are adequate to meet liquidity requirements.

New Accounting Standards and Accounting Changes

The  Financial   Accounting   Standards  Board  issued  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities " (FAS 133), which is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal
years  beginning  after  June  15,  2000.  FAS 133  establishes  accounting  and
reporting standards for derivative  instruments and hedging activities.  FAS 133
requires  entities to recognize all  derivatives as either assets or liabilities
in the balance sheet and measure those  instruments  at fair value.  The Company
does not believe FAS 133 will materially effect its financial statements.

Environmental Matters

The Company like others in the commercial  real estate  industry,  is subject to
numerous  environmental  laws and  regulations and the operation of dry cleaning
plants at the Company's shopping centers is the principal environmental concern.
The Company  believes  that the dry cleaners are  operating in  accordance  with
current laws and  regulations  and has  established  procedures to monitor their
operations. The Company has approximately 38 properties that will require or are
currently  undergoing  varying  levels  of  environmental   remediation.   These
remediations are not expected to have a material financial effect on the Company
due to financial  statement reserves and various  state-regulated  programs that
shift  the  responsibility  and  cost for  remediation  to the  state.  Based on
information presently available, no additional  environmental accruals were made
and management believes that the ultimate disposition of currently known matters
will not  have a  material  effect  on the  financial  position,  liquidity,  or
operations of the Company.


Inflation

Inflation has remained relatively low during 1999 and 1998 and has had a minimal
impact  on  the  operating   performance  of  the  shopping  centers;   however,
substantially all of the Company's  long-term leases contain provisions designed
to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.  Such  provisions  include  clauses
enabling  the Company to receive  percentage  rentals  based on  tenants'  gross
sales, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which
generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases.  Such escalation
clauses are often  related to increases  in the consumer  price index or similar
inflation  indices.  In addition,  many of the Company's leases are for terms of
less than ten years,  which  permits  the Company to seek  increased  rents upon
re-rental at market rates.  Most of the Company's  leases require the tenants to
pay their share of operating expenses,  including common area maintenance,  real
estate taxes,  insurance and utilities,  thereby reducing the Company's exposure
to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.

Year 2000 System Compliance

Management recognized the potential effect Year 2000 could have on the Company's
operations  and, as a result,  implemented a Year 2000 Compliance  Project.  The
project  included an awareness phase, an assessment  phase, a renovation  phase,
and a testing  phase of the data  processing  network,  accounting  and property
management  systems,  computer and operating  systems,  software  packages,  and
building management  systems.  The project also included surveying major tenants
and financial institutions.  The Company's computer hardware, operating systems,
business  systems,  general  accounting  and  property  management  systems  and
principal desktop software  applications are Year 2000 compliant.  Additionally,
the Company  did not incur and does not expect any  business  interruption  as a
result of any of its  customers  or financial  institutions  not being Year 2000
compliant.


Item 7a.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

The Company is exposed to interest  rate  changes  primarily  as a result of its
line of credit and  long-term  debt used to maintain  liquidity and fund capital
expenditures and expansion of the Company's real estate investment portfolio and
operations.  The Company's  interest rate risk management  objective is to limit
the impact of interest  rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its
overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives the Company borrows primarily
at fixed  rates and may enter  into  derivative  financial  instruments  such as
interest rate swaps,  caps and treasury  locks in order to mitigate its interest
rate risk on a related financial  instrument.  The Company has no plans to enter
into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative  purposes,  and at
December  31,  1999,  the  Company  did not  have  any  borrowings  hedged  with
derivative financial instruments.

The Company's interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The
table below presents the principal  amounts  maturing (in  thousands),  weighted
average  interest rates of remaining  debt, and the fair value of total debt (in
thousands), by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and
sensitivity to interest rate changes.




As the table  incorporates  only those  exposures  that exist as of December 31,
1999, it does not consider those  exposures or positions which could arise after
that date.  Moreover,  because firm  commitments  are not presented in the table
above,  the information  presented  therein has limited  predictive  value. As a
result,  the Company's  ultimate  realized gain or loss with respect to interest
rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, the
Company's hedging strategies at that time, and interest rates.

                          Independent Auditors' Report


The Shareholders and Board of Directors
Regency Realty Corporation:


We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Regency Realty
Corporation  as of  December  31, 1999 and 1998,  and the  related  consolidated
statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the  three-year  period ended  December 31,  1999.  These  consolidated
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of Regency  Realty
Corporation  as of  December  31,  1999  and  1998,  and the  results  of  their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period
ended  December  31,  1999 in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

       (a)    Organization and Principles of Consolidation

              The accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  include the
              accounts of Regency Realty Corporation, its wholly owned qualified
              REIT   subsidiaries,   and  its  majority   owned  or   controlled
              subsidiaries  and partnerships  (the "Company" or "Regency").  All
              significant  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  been
              eliminated in the consolidated  financial statements.  The Company
              owns  approximately 97% of the outstanding common units of Regency
              Centers,  L.P.,  ("RCLP"  or the  "Partnership")  and  partnership
              interests  ranging  from 51% to 93% in five  majority  owned  real
              estate  partnerships  (the  "Majority  Partnerships").  The equity
              interests  of  third   parties  held  in  RCLP  and  the  Majority
              Partnerships are included in the consolidated financial statements
              as  preferred  or  exchangeable  operating  partnership  units and
              limited  partners'  interests in  consolidated  partnerships.  The
              Company is a qualified real estate investment trust ("REIT") which
              began operations in 1993.

        (b)   Revenues

              The Company leases space to tenants under  agreements with varying
              terms.  Leases are accounted for as operating  leases with minimum
              rent  recognized  on a  straight-line  basis  over the term of the
              lease  regardless  of when  payments  are due.  Accrued  rents are
              included in tenant receivables.  Minimum rent has been adjusted to
              reflect the effects of recognizing rent on a straight line basis.

              Substantially all of the lease agreements contain provisions which
              provide   additional   rents  based  on  tenants'   sales   volume
              (contingent or percentage  rent) or  reimbursement of the tenants'
              share of real  estate  taxes and certain  common area  maintenance
              (CAM) costs.  These additional rents are recognized as the tenants
              achieve the specified targets as defined in the lease agreements.

              Other non-rental  revenues from management,  leasing and brokerage
              fees are recognized as revenue when earned.


                                   F-9



                           REGENCY REALTY CORPORATION

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                                December 31, 1999

       (c)    Real Estate Investments

              Land,  buildings and improvements are recorded at cost. All direct
              and  indirect  costs  clearly  associated  with  the  acquisition,
              development   and   construction   of  real  estate  projects  are
              capitalized as buildings and improvements.

              Maintenance  and repairs which do not improve or extend the useful
              lives of the  respective  assets are  reflected in  operating  and
              maintenance expense. The property cost includes the capitalization
              of interest  expense  incurred  during  construction in accordance
              with generally accepted accounting principles.

              Depreciation  is  computed  using the  straight  line  method over
              estimated  useful  lives  up to  forty  years  for  buildings  and
              improvements,  term of lease for tenant improvements,  and five to
              seven years for furniture and equipment.

              The Company  reviews its real estate  investments  for  impairment
              whenever  events or changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the
              carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

       (d)    Income Taxes

              The Company qualifies and intends to continue to qualify as a REIT
              under the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, the Company is allowed
              to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of its  distributions
              to stockholders. As distributions have exceeded taxable income, no
              provision   for  federal   income  taxes  has  been  made  in  the
              accompanying consolidated financial statements.

              Earnings and profits,  which determine the taxability of dividends
              to  stockholders,  differ from net income  reported for  financial
              reporting  purposes  primarily  because of  different  depreciable
              lives and bases of rental properties and differences in the timing
              of recognition of earnings upon disposition of properties.

              Regency   Realty  Group,   Inc.,   ("RRG")  and  PRT   Development
              Corporation ("PRTDC") are taxable subsidiaries of the Company. RRG
              and PRTDC are subject to Federal and state  income  taxes and file
              separate tax returns. RRG and PRTDC had combined taxable income of
              $3,465,262, $774,756 and $890,404 for the years ended December 31,
              1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  RRG and PRTDC incurred Federal
              and state income tax of $1,502,876, $223,657 and $327,013 in 1999,
              1998 and 1997, respectively.

              At December  31, 1999 and 1998,  the net book basis of real estate
              assets  exceeds the tax basis by  approximately  $197  million and
              $122  million,  respectively,  primarily  due  to  the  difference
              between the cost basis of the assets  acquired and their carryover
              basis recorded for tax purposes.

                           REGENCY REALTY CORPORATION

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                                December 31, 1999

       (d)    Income Taxes (continued)

              The following  summarizes  the tax status of dividends paid during
              the years ended December 31 (unaudited):

                                            1999             1998          1997
                                            ----             ----          ----
              Dividend per share          $ 1.84             1.76          1.68
              Ordinary income                 75%              71%          85%
              Capital gain                     2%               2%           -
              Return of capital               23%              27%          15%

        (e)   Deferred Costs

              Deferred  costs  consist  of  internal  and  external  commissions
              associated  with  leasing  the  rental  property  and  loan  costs
              incurred  in  obtaining  financing  which are  limited  to initial
              direct and incremental  costs. The net leasing  commission balance
              was  $7.1  and  $3.3  million  at  December  31,  1999  and  1998,
              respectively.  The net loan cost balance was $5.4 and $3.5 million
              at  December  31,  1999 and  1998,  respectively.  Such  costs are
              deferred and amortized over the terms of the respective leases and
              loans.

       (f)    Earnings Per Share

              Basic net income per share of common stock is computed  based upon
              the weighted  average number of common shares  outstanding  during
              the year.  Diluted net income per share also includes common share
              equivalents  for stock options,  exchangeable  partnership  units,
              preferred stock, and Class B common stock when dilutive.  See note
              7 for the calculation of earnings per share.

       (g)    Cash and Cash Equivalents

              Any instruments  which have an original maturity of ninety days or
              less when purchased are considered cash equivalents.

       (h)    Estimates

              The  preparation  of  financial   statements  in  conformity  with
              generally accepted  accounting  principles  requires the Company's
              management  to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the
              reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities,  and  disclosure  of
              contingent  assets and  liabilities,  at the date of the financial
              statements  and the  reported  amounts of  revenues  and  expenses
              during the  reporting  period.  Actual  results  could differ from
              those estimates.

       (i)    Stock Option Plan

              The Company  applies the  provisions of SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting
              for Stock Based Compensation",  which allows companies a choice in
              the method of accounting for stock options. Entities may recognize
              as  expense  over  the  vesting  period  the  fair  value  of  all
              stock-based  awards  on the date of  grant  or SFAS  No.  123 also
              permits  entities  to  continue  to apply  the  provisions  of APB
              Opinion No. 25 and provide pro

       (j)    Reclassifications

              Certain  reclassifications  have been made to the 1998  amounts to
              conform to classifications adopted in 1999.

2.     Acquisitions of Shopping Centers

       On September  23, 1998,  the Company  entered into an Agreement of Merger
       ("Agreement")  with Pacific  Retail Trust  ("Pacific"),  a privately held
       real  estate  investment  trust.  The  Agreement,  among  other  matters,
       provided for the merger of Pacific into Regency, and the exchange of each
       Pacific  common or preferred  share into 0.48 shares of Regency common or
       preferred  stock.  The  stockholders  approved  the  merger  at a Special
       Meeting of Stockholders held February 26, 1999. On February 28, 1999, the
       effective  date of the merger,  the  Company  issued  equity  instruments
       valued at $770.6  million to the Pacific  stockholders  in  exchange  for
       their  outstanding  common and preferred shares and units. The total cost
       to acquire Pacific was approximately $1.157 billion based on the value of
       Regency  shares  issued,  including  the  assumption  of $379  million of
       outstanding debt and other liabilities of Pacific, and closing costs. The
       price per share used to determine the purchase price was $23.325 based on
       the five day average of the closing stock price of Regency's common stock
       on the New York Stock Exchange  immediately before,  during and after the
       date the terms of the merger were agreed to and  announced to the public.
       The  merger  was  accounted  for as a  purchase  with the  Company as the
       acquiring entity.

       During 1998, the Company  acquired 43 shopping centers and joint ventures
       for a total  investment of $384.3  million  ("1998  Acquisitions").  With
       respect to these  acquisitions,  during 1999, the Company paid contingent
       consideration  valued at $9.0 million  consisting of 69,555 Units,  3,768
       shares of common stock,  and $7.0 million.  During 2000,  the Company may
       pay contingent  consideration of up to an estimated $7.5 million, through
       the issuance of Units, stock and the payment of cash.

       The operating  results of Pacific and the 1998  Acquisitions are included
       in the Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  from the date each
       property was  acquired.  The following  unaudited  pro forma  information
       presents the  consolidated  results of  operations  as if Pacific and all
       1998  Acquisitions  had  occurred  on  January  1,  1998.  Such pro forma
       information  reflects adjustments to 1) increase  depreciation,  interest
       expense,  and  general  and  administrative  costs,  2) remove the office
       buildings  sold, and 3) adjust the weighted  average  common shares,  and
       common  equivalent shares  outstanding  issued to acquire the properties.
       Pro forma  revenues  would  have been  $324.7  and  $289.9  million as of
       December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Pro forma net income for common
       stockholders  would have been $94.1 and $81.0  million as of December 31,
       1999 and 1998,

2.      Acquisitions of Shopping Centers (continued)

       respectively.  Pro forma basic net income per share would have been $1.58
       and  $1.35 as of  December  31,  1999 and 1998,  respectively.  Pro forma
       diluted  net  income per share  would  have been  $1.58 and $1.34,  as of
       December 31, 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  This data does not purport to
       be  indicative  of what  would have  occurred  had  Pacific  and the 1998
       Acquisitions  been made on January 1, 1998, or of results which may occur
       in the future.

3.     Segments

       The Company was formed,  and  currently  operates,  for the purpose of 1)
       operating and developing  Company owned retail  shopping  centers (Retail
       segment),  and  2)  providing  services  including  property  management,
       leasing,  brokerage,  and  construction  and  development  management for
       third-parties  (Service operations  segment).  The Company had previously
       operated  four  office  buildings  that  were sold  during  1998 and 1997
       (Office  buildings  segment).  The Company's  reportable  segments  offer
       different  products or services and are managed  separately  because each
       requires  different  strategies  and management  expertise.  There are no
       material inter-segment sales or transfers.

       The Company  assesses and measures  operating  results  starting with Net
       Operating Income for the Retail and Office Buildings  segments and Income
       for the Service  operations  segment and  converts  such  amounts  into a
       performance  measure  referred to as Funds From Operations  ("FFO").  The
       operating  results for the individual  retail shopping  centers have been
       aggregated  since all of the Company's  shopping  centers  exhibit highly
       similar economic  characteristics as neighborhood  shopping centers,  and
       offer  similar  degrees  of risk and  opportunities  for  growth.  FFO as
       defined by the  National  Association  of Real Estate  Investment  Trusts
       consists of net income  (computed in accordance  with generally  accepted
       accounting   principles)   excluding   gains   (or   losses)   from  debt
       restructuring and sales of income producing property held for investment,
       plus  depreciation and  amortization of real estate,  and adjustments for
       unconsolidated   investments  in  real  estate   partnerships  and  joint
       ventures.  The  Company  further  adjusts  FFO by  distributions  made to
       holders  of Units and  preferred  stock  that  results  in a diluted  FFO
       amount. The Company considers diluted FFO to be the industry standard for
       reporting the  operations  of real estate  investment  trusts  ("REITs").
       Adjustments for investments in real estate partnerships are calculated to
       reflect  diluted FFO on the same basis.  While  management  believes that
       diluted FFO is the most relevant and widely used measure of the Company's
       performance,  such amount does not represent cash flow from operations as
       defined  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  should  not be
       considered an  alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's
       operating  performance,  and is not  indicative of cash available to fund
       all cash flow needs.  Additionally,  the Company's calculation of diluted
       FFO,  as  provided  below,  may not be  comparable  to  similarly  titled
       measures of other REITs.

       The accounting  policies of the segments are the same as those  described
       in  note 1.  The  revenues,  diluted  FFO,  and  assets  for  each of the
       reportable  segments are  summarized as follows for the years ended as of
       December 31, 1999,  1998,  and 1997.  Non-segment  assets to reconcile to
       total assets include cash and deferred costs.

4.     Investments in Real Estate Partnerships

       The Company  accounts for all  investments in which it owns less than 50%
       and  does not have  controlling  financial  interest,  using  the  equity
       method. The Company's combined investment in these partnerships was $66.9
       and $30.6 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Net income
       is allocated to the Company in accordance with the respective partnership
       agreement.

5.     Notes Payable and Acquisition and Development Line of Credit

       The Company's  outstanding debt at December 31, 1999 and 1998 consists of
       the following (in thousands):

                                                          1999            1998

          Variable rate mortgage loans                    11,376          11,051
          Fixed rate unsecured loans                     370,696         121,296

      Acquisition and development line of credit         247,179         117,631
                                                       ---------         -------
               Total                                $  1,011,966         548,126
                                                       =========         =======

       During  February,  1999, the Company  modified the terms of its unsecured
       acquisition and development line of credit (the "Line") by increasing the
       commitment to $635  million.  This credit  agreement  also provides for a
       competitive bid facility of up to $250 million of the commitment  amount.
       Maximum availability under the Line is based on the discounted value of a
       pool  of  eligible  unencumbered  assets  (determined  on  the  basis  of
       capitalized  net  operating  income)  less the  amount  of the  Company's
       outstanding unsecured liabilities. The Line matures in February 2001, but
       may be extended annually for one year periods.  Borrowings under the Line
       bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified  spread,
       (1.00% currently),  which is dependent on the Company's  investment grade
       rating.  The Company is required to comply,  and is in  compliance,  with
       certain  financial  and  other  covenants  customary  with  this  type of
       unsecured  financing.  These financial covenants include among others (i)
       maintenance  of minimum  net worth,  (ii) ratio of total  liabilities  to
       gross asset  value,  (iii) ratio of secured  indebtedness  to gross asset
       value, (iv) ratio of EBITDA to interest  expense,  (v) ratio of EBITDA to
       debt service and reserve for replacements, and (vi) ratio of unencumbered
       net operating income to interest expense on unsecured  indebtedness.  The
       Line is used primarily to finance the acquisition and development of real
       estate, but is also available for general working capital purposes.

       Mortgage loans are secured by certain real estate properties,  and may be
       prepaid subject to a prepayment of a yield-maintenance  premium. Mortgage
       loans are generally due in monthly installments of interest and principal
       and mature over various terms through 2019.  Variable  interest  rates on
       mortgage  loans are currently  based on LIBOR plus a spread in a range of
       125 basis points to 150 basis points.  Fixed  interest  rates on mortgage
       loans range from 7.04% to 9.8%.

       During 1999, the Company assumed debt with a fair value of $402.6 million
       related to the  acquisition of real estate,  which includes debt premiums
       of $4.1 million  based upon the above market  interest  rates of the debt
       instruments.  Debt  premiums  are being  amortized  over the terms of the
       related debt instruments, as an adjustment to interest expense.

5.     Notes Payable and Acquisition and Development Line of Credit (continued)

       On April 15, 1999 the  Company,  through  RCLP,  completed a $250 million
       unsecured debt offering in two tranches.  The Company issued $200 million
       7.4% notes due April 1, 2004,  priced at 99.922% to yield 7.42%,  and $50
       million 7.75% notes due April 1, 2009,  priced at 100%.  The net proceeds
       of the offering were used to reduce the balance of the Line.

       As of December 31, 1999,  scheduled principal repayments on notes payable
       and the Line were as follows (in thousands):



       Unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures had mortgage loans payable
       of $50.3 million at December 31, 1999,  and the  Company's  proportionate
       share of these loans was $21.2 million.

       The fair value of the  Company's  notes  payable  and Line are  estimated
       based on the current rates  available to the Company for debt of the same
       remaining  maturities.  Variable  rate notes  payable,  and the Company's
       Line, are considered to be at fair value since the interest rates on such
       instruments  reprice based on current  market  conditions.  Notes payable
       with fixed rates, that have been assumed in connection with acquisitions,
       are recorded in the accompanying  financial statements at fair value. The
       Company  considers  the  carrying  value of all other  fixed  rate  notes
       payable to be a  reasonable  estimation  of their fair value based on the
       fact that the rates of such notes are similar to rates  available  to the
       Company for debt of the same terms.

6.     Stockholders' Equity and Minority Interest

       On June 11, 1996, the Company entered into a Stockholders  Agreement (the
       "Agreement")  with  SC-USREALTY   granting  it  certain  rights  such  as
       purchasing  common  stock,  nominating  representatives  to the Company's
       Board of Directors,  and subjecting  SC-USREALTY to certain  restrictions
       including voting and ownership restrictions. In connection with the Units
       and  shares of common  stock  issued in March  1998  related  to  earnout
       payments,  SC-USREALTY  acquired  435,777  shares at $22.125 per share in
       accordance  with  their  rights  as  provided  for in the  Agreement.  In
       conjunction with the acquisition of Pacific,  SC-USREALTY exchanged their
       Pacific shares for 22.6 million Regency common shares.

6.     Stockholders' Equity and Minority Interest (continued)

       In connection with the acquisition of shopping  centers,  RCLP has issued
       Exchangeable  Operating Partnership Units to limited partners convertible
       on a one for one basis into shares of common stock of the Company.

       On June 29, 1998,  the Company  through RCLP issued $80 million of 8.125%
       Series A  Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Units  ("Series A  Preferred
       Units") to an institutional investor in a private placement. The issuance
       involved the sale of 1.6 million Series A Preferred  Units for $50.00 per
       unit.  The  Series  A  Preferred  Units,  which  may  be  called  by  the
       Partnership at par on or after June 25, 2003,  have no stated maturity or
       mandatory  redemption,  and pay a  cumulative,  quarterly  dividend at an
       annualized rate of 8.125%.  At any time after June 25, 2008, the Series A
       Preferred Units may be exchanged for shares of 8.125% Series A Cumulative
       Redeemable  Preferred  Stock of the  Company at an  exchange  rate of one
       share of Series A Preferred  Stock for one Series A Preferred  Unit.  The
       Series A Preferred Units and Series A Preferred Stock are not convertible
       into common stock of the Company.  The net proceeds of the offering  were
       used to reduce the Line.

       On  September  3, 1999,  the Company  through  RCLP issued $85 million of
       8.75% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units ("Series B Preferred
       Units") to an institutional investor in a private placement. The issuance
       involved  the sale of 850,000  Series B  Preferred  Units for $100.00 per
       unit.  The  Series  B  Preferred  Units,  which  may  be  called  by  the
       Partnership at par on or after September 3, 2004, have no stated maturity
       or mandatory redemption,  and pay a cumulative,  quarterly dividend at an
       annualized rate of 8.75%. At any time after September 3, 2009, the Series
       B  Preferred  Units  may be  exchanged  for  shares  of  8.75%  Series  B
       Cumulative  Redeemable Preferred Stock of the Company at an exchange rate
       of one share of Series B Preferred Stock for one Series B Preferred Unit.
       The  Series B  Preferred  Units  and  Series B  Preferred  Stock  are not
       convertible  into common  stock of the  Company.  The net proceeds of the
       offering were used to reduce the Line.

       On September 3, 1999, the Company through RCLP issued $75 million of 9.0%
       Series C  Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Units  ("Series C  Preferred
       Units") to an institutional investor in a private placement. The issuance
       involved  the sale of 750,000  Series C  Preferred  Units for $100.00 per
       unit.  The  Series  C  Preferred  Units,  which  may  be  called  by  the
       Partnership at par on or after September 3, 2004, have no stated maturity
       or mandatory redemption,  and pay a cumulative,  quarterly dividend at an
       annualized  rate of 9.0%. At any time after September 3, 2009, the Series
       C Preferred Units may be exchanged for shares of 9.0% Series C Cumulative
       Redeemable  Preferred  Stock of the  Company at an  exchange  rate of one
       share of Series C Preferred  Stock for one Series C Preferred  Unit.  The
       Series C Preferred Units and Series C Preferred Stock are not convertible
       into common stock of the Company.  The net proceeds of the offering  were
       used to reduce the Line.

       On  September  29, 1999,  the Company  through RCLP issued $50 million of
       9.125%  Series  D  Cumulative   Redeemable  Preferred  Units  ("Series  D
       Preferred  Units") to an institutional  investor in a private  placement.
       The issuance  involved the sale of 500,000  Series D Preferred  Units for
       $100.00 per unit.  The Series D Preferred  Units,  which may be called by
       the  Partnership  at par on or after  September 29, 2004,  have no stated
       maturity  or  mandatory  redemption,  and  pay  a  cumulative,  quarterly
       dividend at an annualized rate of 9.125%. At any time after September 29,
       2009, the Series D Preferred  Units may be exchanged for shares of 9.125%
       Series D  Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock of the  Company  at an
       exchange  rate of one share of Series D Preferred  Stock for one Series D
       Preferred Unit. The Series D Preferred Units and Series D Preferred Stock
       are not convertible into common stock of the Company. The net proceeds of
       the offering were used to reduce the Line.

       As part of the  acquisition of Pacific  Retail Trust,  the Company issued
       Series 1 and Series 2 preferred  shares.  Series 1  preferred  shares are
       convertible  into Series 2 preferred  shares on a  one-for-one  basis and
       contain  provisions  for  adjustment  to prevent  dilution.  The Series 1
       preferred shares are entitled to a quarterly  dividend in an amount equal
       to $0.0271  less than the common  dividend and are  cumulative.  Series 2
       preferred  shares are  convertible  into common  shares on a  one-for-one
       basis. The Series 2 preferred shares are entitled to quarterly  dividends
       in an amount equal to the common dividend and are cumulative. The Company
       may redeem the  preferred  shares any time after  October  20,  2010 at a
       price of $20.83 per share, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends.  During
       1999, a holder of Series 2 preferred  shares  converted their shares into
       14,987 shares of common stock.

6.     Stockholders' Equity and Minority Interest (continued)

       During  the  fourth  quarter,  the  Board  of  Directors  authorized  the
       repurchase of up to $65 million of the Company's  outstanding shares from
       time to  time  through  periodic  open  market  transactions  or  through
       privately negotiated transactions.  At December 31, 1999, the Company had
       repurchased 2.7 million shares for $54.5 million.

       During 1999, the holders of all of Regency's Class B stock converted
       2,500,000 shares into 2,975,468 shares of common stock.

7.     Earnings Per Share

       The following  summarizes the  calculation of basic and diluted  earnings
       per share for the  years  ended,  December  31,  1999,  1998 and 1997 (in
       thousands except per share data):




         The Preferred  Series 1 and Series 2 stock and the Class B common stock
         are not included in the above  calculation  because  their  effects are
         anti-dilutive.

8.     Long-Term Stock Incentive Plans

       In 1993,  the  Company  adopted a  Long-Term  Omnibus  Plan (the  "Plan")
       pursuant  to which  the  Board of  Directors  may  grant  stock and stock
       options to officers, directors and other key employees. The Plan provides
       for the issuance of up to 12% of the Company's common shares  outstanding
       not to exceed 8.5 million  shares.  Stock  options  are  granted  with an
       exercise  price  equal to the stock's  fair  market  value at the date of
       grant.  All stock options  granted have ten year terms,  and become fully
       exercisable  after four years from the date of grant,  with the exception
       of  options  issued  to  directors  prior  to  1999  which  become  fully
       exercisable after one year.

       At  December  31,  1999,  there were  approximately  2.7  million  shares
       available for grant under the Plan. The per share  weighted-average  fair
       value of stock options  granted  during 1999 and 1998 was $1.23 and $2.22
       on the date of grant using the Black  Scholes  option-pricing  model with
       the  following  weighted-average  assumptions:  1999 - expected  dividend
       yield 9.2%, risk-free interest rate of 5.7%, expected volatility 21%, and
       an  expected  life of 5.3 years;  1998 - expected  dividend  yield  7.5%,
       risk-free interest rate of 4.8%, expected volatility 21%, and an expected
       life of 6.5 years.  The Company  applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting
       for its Plan and,  accordingly,  no compensation cost has been recognized
       for its stock options in the consolidated financial statements.

       Had the Company  determined  compensation cost based on the fair value at
       the grant date for its stock  options  under SFAS No. 123, the  Company's
       net  income for common  stockholders  would have been  reduced to the pro
       forma amounts indicated below (in thousands except per share data):

       Also as part of the Plan,  certain  officers and employees  have received
       loans to purchase  stock at market rates of  interest,  have been granted
       restricted  stock,  and have been granted  dividend  equivalents.  During
       1999,  1998 and 1997,  the Company  charged  $1,030,645,  $1,322,164  and
       $1,115,906,  respectively,  to income on the  consolidated  statement  of

       The  shopping  centers'  tenant  base  includes  primarily  national  and
       regional supermarkets,  drug stores, discount department stores and other
       retailers  and,  consequently,  the credit  risk is  concentrated  in the
       retail industry. There were no tenants which individually represented 10%
       or more of the Company's combined minimum rent.

10.    Contingencies

       The  Company  like others in the  commercial  real  estate  industry,  is
       subject to numerous  environmental laws and regulations and the operation
       of dry cleaning plants at the Company's shopping centers is the principal
       environmental  concern.  The Company  believes  that the dry cleaners are
       operating  in  accordance  with  current  laws  and  regulations  and has
       established procedures to monitor their operations. While the Company has
       registered  the plants  located in Florida  under a state funded  program
       designed  to  substantially  fund the  clean  up,  if  necessary,  of any
       environmental  issues,  the owner or  operator is not  relieved  from the
       ultimate  responsibility  for clean up. The Company also has  established
       due diligence procedures to identify and evaluate potential environmental
       issues on properties under  consideration for acquisition.  In connection
       with  acquisitions  during 1999 and 1998,  the  Company  has  established
       environmental reserves which amounted to $2.6 million and $2.2 million at
       December  31, 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  While it is not  possible to
       predict  with  certainty,  management  believes  that  the  reserves  are
       adequate to cover  future  clean-up  costs  related to these  sites.  The
       Company's  policy is to accrue  environmental  clean-up  costs when it is
       probable that a liability has been incurred and that amount is reasonably
       estimable.  Based  on  information  presently  available,  no  additional
       environmental  accruals  were  made  and  management  believes  that  the
       ultimate  disposition of currently known matters will not have a material
       effect  on  the  financial  position,  liquidity,  or  operations  of the
       Company.

  11.  Market and Dividend Information (Unaudited)

       The  Company's  common  stock is  traded on the New York  Stock  Exchange
       ("NYSE") under the symbol "REG". The Company  currently has approximately
       3,500  shareholders.  The  following  table  sets  forth the high and low
       prices and the cash dividends  declared on the Company's  common stock by
       quarter for 1999 and 1998:
