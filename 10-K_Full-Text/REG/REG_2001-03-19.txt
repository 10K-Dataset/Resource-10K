Forward Looking Statements

        This report on Form 10-K  contains  certain  forward-looking  statements
under  the  federal  securities  law.  These  statements  are  based on  current
expectations, estimates, and projections about the industry and markets in which
Regency Centers Corporation  operates,  management's  beliefs,  and assumptions.
Forward-looking  statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve
certain credit risks and uncertainties,  which are difficult to predict.  Actual
operating  results may be affected  by changes in  national  and local  economic
conditions,  competitive  market  conditions,  weather,  obtaining  governmental
approvals  and  meeting  development  schedules,   and  therefore,   may  differ
materially from what is expressed or forecasted in this report.



                                     PART I

Item 1. Business

        The real estate business of Regency Centers Corporation  ("Regency") was
established in 1963 as a Jacksonville,  Florida-based  operator and developer of
shopping centers.  By the early 1990s,  Regency had developed a successful track
record of developing,  owning and operating  neighborhood and community shopping
centers, which offered substantial cycle-resistant  opportunities for growth. In
1993, Regency was formed as a Florida corporation,  completed its initial public
offering (NYSE: REG) and became a qualified self-administered, self-managed real
estate investment trust (REIT).

        Through a series of major strategic acquisitions in 1997, 1998 and 1999,
Regency  expanded  its  development  and  operational  capabilities  to  have  a
nationwide  scope.  From  1993 to 2000,  Regency's  assets  increased  from $154
million to approximately $3 billion with 242 shopping centers in 22 states.  The
most  significant  of these  transactions  was Regency's  acquisition of Pacific
Retail Trust for  approximately  $1.157 billion in February 1999. At the date of
the acquisition,  Pacific Retail Trust was operating or had under development 71
retail  shopping  centers  representing  8.4 million SF of gross  leaseable area
(GLA).

        Regency previously  operated under the name Regency Realty  Corporation,
but changed its name to Regency  Centers  Corporation  in February  2001 to more
appropriately  acknowledge  its  brand  and  position  in  the  shopping  center
industry.  Regency  invests in retail  shopping  centers through its partnership
interest in Regency Centers,  L.P.,  ("RCLP") an operating  partnership in which
Regency currently owns  approximately 98% of the outstanding  common partnership
units ("Units"). The acquisition, development, operations and financing activity
of Regency  including  the issuance of Units or  preferred  units is executed by
RCLP.

        At December 31, 2000, Regency's GLA totals 27.1 million square feet, and
is 95.3 percent  leased.  Geographically,  23.5% of Regency's  GLA is located in
Florida,  17.7% in California,  15% in Texas, 9.2% in Georgia, 6.3% in Ohio, and
28.3% spread  throughout 17 other states.  Today,  Regency  Centers is a leading
owner, operator and developer of grocer-anchored,  neighborhood shopping centers
with high-quality specialty retailers located in prosperous trade areas.

        See also footnote 3, Segments, to the consolidated  financial statements
included herein, for a related discussion of the Company's business.

Operating and Investment Philosophy

        Our key  operating  and  investment  objective  is to  create  long-term
shareholder value by:

o       focusing on high quality grocer-anchored neighborhood shopping centers
          in attractive markets;

o       maximizing the value of the portfolio through our research-based
          investment strategies, our Preferred Customer Initiative program,
          and our customer-driven development program; and

o       using conservative  financial  management and our substantial capital
          base to cost effectively access capital to fund our growth.

Grocer-Anchored Strategy

        We  focus  our  investment  strategy  on  grocer-anchored   neighborhood
shopping  centers that are located in infill  locations or high growth corridors
and are anchored by a dominant  grocer in the local  market.  Regardless  of the
economic cycle, grocer sales have outpaced inflation in 10 of the last 15 years.
More  resistant to down cycles by the nature of their  business,  market-leading
grocers generate  continuous  consumer traffic to our centers.  Such significant
traffic  driven by necessity and  convenience  attracts and benefits our centers
and side-shop tenants.




        The average remaining lease term for Regency's  grocer-anchored  tenants
is 14.5 years.  Since these grocers can leverage their  leadership  positions in
their  respective  markets to draw steady traffic,  their  commitment to signing
long-term  leases  provides  Regency with stability and  sustainability  of cash
flow.

        Our  grocer-anchored  centers  are  planned to serve  neighborhoods  and
communities,  and their carefully  selected  locations  enable local shoppers to
visit weekly,  or even several times a week. As a result, a neighborhood  center
is a  convenient,  cost-effective  distribution  platform  for  food  retailers.
Moreover,  a neighborhood  center that is anchored by a leading grocer is highly
resistant to competition from Internet  e-tailers and mass  merchandise  stores,
benefiting all of our tenants.

        Grocer-anchored  centers  generate  substantial  daily traffic and offer
sustainable competitive advantages to their tenants. This high traffic generates
increased  sales,  thereby driving higher  occupancy,  higher rental rates,  and
higher  rental rate  growth for Regency -- meaning  that we can sustain our cash
flow growth and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term.

        Ninety percent of Regency's  grocer-anchored centers are anchored by one
of the top three  grocers in their local  markets.  Our anchor  tenants  include
leading supermarket chains like Kroger,  Publix,  Safeway and Albertson's.  With
average annual sales for a Regency grocer of $22.4 million,  our grocers outpace
their  respective chain averages by more than 20 percent and generate an average
of more than 14,000  shopper  visits  each week,  or more than  725,000  shopper
visits annually.

Research Driven Market Selection

        Grocer-anchored  centers are best  located in  neighborhood  trade areas
with attractive  demographics.  The typical Regency center 3-mile  population is
approximately  75,000  strong  with an  average  household  income  in excess of
$71,000 and a projected  5-year  population  growth of more than 8 percent.  The
trade areas of Regency's  centers are growing nearly twice as fast and household
incomes are more than 30 percent greater than the national averages, translating
into more retail buying power. Once specific markets are selected, Regency seeks
the best  location  within  the best  neighborhoods,  preferably  occupying  the
dominant corner, close to residential communities, with excellent visibility for
our tenants and easy access for neighborhood shoppers.

Premier Customer Initiative

        For the same  reason  we  choose  to anchor  our  centers  with  leading
grocers,  we also seek a range of strong national,  regional and local specialty
tenants.  We have created a formal  partnering  process -- the Premier  Customer
Initiative  (PCI)  -- to  promote  mutually  beneficial  relationships  with our
non-grocer specialty  retailers.  The objective of PCI is for Regency to build a
base of specialty tenants who represent the  "best-in-class"  operators in their
respective merchandising categories.  Such tenants reinforce the consumer appeal
and other  strengths of a center's  grocer-anchor,  help to stabilize a center's
occupancy,  reduce  releasing  downtime,  lower tenant turnover and yield higher
sustainable  rents.  For these  reasons,  Regency is  committed  to giving these
premier  tenants all the support they  require to realize  their  expansion  and
profit objectives. The PCI program does this by partnering with top neighborhood
operators  while they are in the  strategic  stage of  store-location  planning.
Regency's  industry  expertise  enables  us to  offer  our  prospective  tenants
current,  in-depth data on key markets nationwide, as well as access to multiple
prime locations in the best shopping centers,  and in the top markets,  with the
leading  grocer-anchors.  Moreover,  our  PCI  tenants  benefit  from  employing
standardized leases as they contract for space in multiple Regency locations.





Customer-driven Development

        Development is  customer-driven,  meaning we have an executed lease from
the anchor in hand before we purchase the land. As a result of commitments  from
our anchor tenants,  and our  well-established  relationships with key specialty
retailers,  a  significant  percentage  of the retail space is dedicated  before
construction  begins.  Developments  serve the growth  needs of our  grocery and
specialty  retail  customers,  result in modern  shopping  centers  with 20-year
leases from the grocer-anchors and produce either attractive returns on invested
capital or profits from sale.

        Our development program significantly  contributed to our overall growth
during the year.  In 2000 we  completed  34  shopping  center and  build-to-suit
developments that represented an investment of $236 million.  On average,  these
newly completed  developments are 96 percent leased. At December 31, 2000 we had
56 shopping center developments, re-developments,  renovations and single-tenant
projects still in progress. When complete, these projects will represent a total
investment of $730 million, $418 million of which has already been funded.

Capital Strategy

        We intend to maintain a conservative  capital structure designed to fund
our growth programs without  returning to the equity markets or compromising our
investment-grade  ratings. This approach is founded on our self-funding business
model,  which  relies  on  capital  sourced  from   free-and-clear   cash  flow;
developments for sale; dispositions of limited-growth, non-strategic assets; and
joint ventures. We have the financial flexibility to follow this approach,  with
a debt-to-total  asset ratio of approximately 41 percent,  an interest  coverage
ratio of 3.0 times, a fixed charge  coverage  ratio of 2.1 times,  and nearly 80
percent of our real estate assets and net operating income being unencumbered by
mortgages.

        During 2000, we sold 22  development  properties  that  generated  total
proceeds in excess of $140 million.  In addition,  in December 2000, we sold two
Regency core  development  properties to a joint venture between Regency and the
highly  respected  Oregon  Public  Employees  Retirement  Fund  (OPERF).   These
transactions  collectively  yielded  more than $180  million in total  proceeds,
which generated $20 million in profits.

        The OPERF joint  venture  represents a major  co-investment  partnership
that is expected to produce  substantial  benefits for our  Company.  During the
third  quarter of 2000,  we  executed a letter of intent  with the Oregon  State
Treasury,  acting on behalf of OPERF,  to form a  co-investment  partnership  to
invest in a $300  million  portfolio  of  neighborhood  and  community  shopping
centers. The first phase of the joint venture was consummated with the formation
of  Columbia  Regency  Retail  Partners,  which  purchased  the  two  properties
mentioned  above. The final phase of the partnership is expected to close during
the 1st  quarter of 2001,  when it will  purchase  three  additional  stabilized
Regency  developments,  and OPERF  will  contribute  three  centers  located  in
attractive infill markets. The partnership also plans to acquire $150 million of
grocer-anchored  shopping centers  throughout the United States over the next 12
to 18 months.  Regency will own 20 percent of the  partnership  and will be paid
asset management fees, property management fees and incentive fees.

Risk Factors Relating to Ownership of Regency Common Stock

        We are subject to certain  business  risks  arising in  connection  with
owning real estate which include, among others:

o   the bankruptcy or insolvency of, or a downturn in the business of, any
       of our major tenants could reduce cash flow,

o   the possibility that such tenants will not renew their leases as they expire
    or renew at lower rental rates could reduce cash flow,

o   risks related to the internet and e-commerce reducing the demand for
       shopping centers,

o   vacated anchor space will affect the entire  shopping  center because of the
       loss of the departed anchor tenant's customer drawing power,

o   poor market  conditions  could create an over supply of space or a reduction
       in demand for real estate in markets where Regency owns shopping centers,

o   Regency's rapid growth could place strains on its resources,

o   risks relating to leverage, including uncertainty that Regency will be
    able to refinance its indebtedness, and the risk of higher interest rates,

o   unsuccessful development activities could reduce cash flow,

o   Regency's  inability to satisfy its cash requirements for operations and the
    possibility   that   Regency  may  be  required  to  borrow  funds  to  meet
    distribution requirements in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT,


Risk Factors Relating to Ownership of Regency Common Stock (continued)

o   potential liability for unknown or future environmental matters and costs of
    compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act,

o   the risk of uninsured losses, and

o   unfavorable  economic  conditions  could  also  result in the  inability  of
    tenants  in certain  retail  sectors to meet  their  lease  obligations  and
    otherwise could  adversely  affect  Regency's  ability to attract and retain
    desirable tenants.

Compliance with Governmental Regulations

        Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations,
we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate  certain hazardous or toxic
substances at our shopping  centers.  These laws often impose liability  without
regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the
hazardous or toxic substances.  The cost of required remediation and the owner's
liability  for  remediation  could exceed the value of the  property  and/or the
aggregate assets of the owner.  The presence of such substances,  or the failure
to properly remediate such substances,  may adversely affect the owner's ability
to sell or rent the property or borrow using the property as collateral. We have
a number of  properties  that will require or are currently  undergoing  varying
levels of environmental remediation. These remediations are not expected to have
a material  financial  effect on Regency due to  financial  statement  reserves,
insurance  programs  designed to mitigate  the cost of  remediation  and various
state-regulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state.

Competition

        We believe  the  ownership  of  shopping  centers is highly  fragmented.
Regency  faces  competition  from other REITs in the  development,  acquisition,
ownership  and  leasing  of  shopping  centers as well as from  numerous  local,
regional and national real estate developers and owners.

Changes in Policies

        Our  Board  of  Directors  establishes  the  policies  that  govern  our
investment and operating  strategies  including,  among others,  debt and equity
financing  policies,  quarterly  distributions  to  shareholders,  and  REIT tax
status.  The Board of Directors  may amend these  policies at any time without a
vote of Regency's shareholders.

Employees

        Our  headquarters  are  located  at 121 West  Forsyth  St.,  Suite  200,
Jacksonville, Florida. Regency presently maintains 18 offices in 11 states where
it conducts  management,  leasing and  development  activities.  At December 31,
2000,  Regency had  approximately 377 employees and believes that relations with
its employees are good.




Item 2. Properties

         The  Company's  properties  summarized by state  including  their gross
leasable areas (GLA) follows:


             * Excludes properties under construction

        The  following  table  summarizes  the  largest  tenants  occupying  the
Company's shopping centers based upon a percentage of total annualized base rent
exceeding  .5% at December 31, 2000.  The table  includes  100% of the base rent
from leases of properties owned by joint ventures.


                   Summary of Principal Tenants > .5% of Annualized Base Rent
                    (including Properties Under Development)





Item 2. Properties (continued)

      The Company's leases have lease terms generally ranging from three to five
years for tenant  space under 5,000  square  feet.  Leases  greater  than 10,000
square feet generally have lease terms in excess of five years, mostly comprised
of anchor  tenants.  Many of the anchor leases contain  provisions  allowing the
tenant  the  option  of  extending  the  term of the  lease at  expiration.  The
Company's  leases  provide for the monthly  payment in advance of fixed  minimum
rentals,  additional rents calculated as a percentage of the tenant's sales, the
tenant's  pro rata  share of real  estate  taxes,  insurance,  and  common  area
maintenance  expenses,  and  reimbursement  for  utility  costs if not  directly
metered.

      The  following  table sets forth a schedule of lease  expirations  for the
      next ten years, assuming that no tenants exercise renewal options:

Item 3.      Legal Proceedings

        The Company is, from time to time, a party to legal  proceedings,  which
arise,  in the ordinary  course of its  business.  The Company is not  currently
involved in any litigation  nor, to  management's  knowledge,  is any litigation
threatened  against the  Company,  the outcome of which would,  in  management's
judgement  based on information  currently  available,  have a material  adverse
effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.


Item 4.      Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

        No matters were submitted for stockholder vote during the fourth quarter
of 2000.


PART Il


Item 5.     Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Shareholder
            Matters

        The  Company's  common  stock is traded on the New York  Stock  Exchange
("NYSE") under the symbol "REG". The Company currently has  approximately  3,500
shareholders.  The  following  table  sets forth the high and low prices and the
cash  dividends  declared on the Company's  common stock by quarter for 2000 and
1999.




        Regency  intends to pay regular  quarterly  distributions  to its common
stockholders.  Future  distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion
of the Board of  Directors,  and will depend upon cash  generated  by  operating
activities,   Regency's  financial  condition,   capital  requirements,   annual
distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986,  as amended,  and such other  factors as the Board of  Directors  deems
relevant.  Regency  anticipates that for the foreseeable  future, cash available
for  distribution  will be greater  than  earnings  and  profits due to non-cash
expenses,  primarily  depreciation and amortization,  to be incurred by Regency.
Distributions  by Regency to the extent of its current and accumulated  earnings
and profits for federal income tax purposes will be taxable to  stockholders  as
ordinary  dividend  income.  Distributions  in excess of  earnings  and  profits
generally will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital. Such distributions
have the effect of deferring  taxation until the sale of a stockholder's  common
stock.  In order to maintain  its  qualification  as a REIT,  Regency  must make
annual  distributions  to  stockholders  of at least 95% of its taxable  income.
Under certain circumstances,  which management does not expect to occur, Regency
could  be  required  to make  distributions  in  excess  of cash  available  for
distributions in order to meet such  requirements.  Regency currently  maintains
the Regency Centers  Corporation  Dividend  Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
which enables its stockholders to automatically reinvest distributions,  as well
as, make voluntary cash payments towards the purchase of additional shares.

        Under the loan  agreement  with the lenders of Regency's line of credit,
distributions  may not exceed 95% of Funds from Operations  ("FFO") based on the
immediately  preceding  four  quarters.  FFO is defined in  accordance  with the
NAREIT definition as described in Regency's  consolidated  financial statements.
Also, in the event of any monetary default,  Regency will not make distributions
to stockholders.

        The  following   describes  the   registrant's   sales  of  unregistered
securities  during the periods covered by this report,  each sold in reliance on
Rule 506 of the Securities Act.

        In May and September 2000, Regency issued $70 million and $24 million of
8.75%  Series  E  and  Series  F  Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Units  (the
"Preferred  Units"),   respectively.  The  issues  were  sold  to  institutional
investors in private placements for $100.00 per unit. The Preferred Units, which
may be called by the  Partnership  at par on or after  May and  September,  2005
respectively,  have  no  stated  maturity  or  mandatory  redemption,  and pay a
cumulative, quarterly dividend at an annualized rate of 8.75%. At any time after
10 years from the date of issuance,  the  Preferred  Units may be exchanged  for
8.75% Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock") at an exchange
rate of one share for one unit.  The Preferred  Units and the related  Preferred
Stock are not  convertible  into common  stock of Regency.  The net  proceeds of
these  offerings  were used to reduce the Line. In 1999,  Regency issued similar
preferred  units in several series in the amount of $210 million with an average
fixed  distribution rate of 8.93%. At December 31, 2000, the face value of total
preferred units issued was $384 million with an average fixed  distribution rate
of 8.72% vs. $290 million with an average  fixed  distribution  rate of 8.71% at
December 31, 1999.

        During 1998, Regency acquired 43 shopping centers and joint ventures for
a total  investment of $384.3 million.  On June 30, 2000,  Regency  acquired the
non-owned  portion of five of the joint ventures for $4.4 million  consisting of
cash, common stock and Units.





Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data
(in thousands, except per share data and number of properties)

        The following  table sets forth Selected  Financial Data on a historical
basis  for the five  years  ended  December  31,  2000,  for the  Company.  This
information  should be read in conjunction with the financial  statements of the
Company  (including the related notes thereto) and  Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of the  Financial  Condition and Results of  Operations,  each included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  This historical  Selected  Financial Data has been
derived from the audited financial statements.






7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

        The  following  discussion  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the
accompanying  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and Notes  thereto of Regency
Centers Corporation ("Regency" or "Company") appearing elsewhere within.

Organization

        Regency is a qualified real estate investment trust ("REIT") which began
operations  in 1993.  Regency had  previously  operated  under the name  Regency
Realty  Corporation,  but changed  its name to Regency  Centers  Corporation  in
February 2001 to more  appropriately  acknowledge  its brand and position in the
shopping center industry. Regency invests in retail shopping centers through its
partnership interest in Regency Centers, L.P., ("RCLP") an operating partnership
in which Regency  currently owns  approximately  98% of the  outstanding  common
partnership  units  ("Units").  The  acquisition,  development,  operations  and
financing activity of Regency including the issuance of Units or preferred units
is executed by RCLP.

Shopping Center Business

         Regency is a national owner, operator and developer of grocery-anchored
neighborhood  retail shopping centers.  Regency's shopping centers summarized by
state and in order by largest  holdings  including  their gross  leasable  areas
(GLA) follows:


         * Excludes pre-stabilized properties under development

         Regency  is  focused  on  building  a  platform  of  grocery   anchored
neighborhood   shopping  centers  because  grocery  stores  provide  convenience
shopping of daily  necessities,  foot traffic for adjacent  local  tenants,  and
should  withstand  adverse economic  conditions.  Regency's  current  investment
markets have  continued  to offer stable  economies,  and  accordingly,  Regency
expects to realize  growth in net income as a result of increasing  occupancy in
the portfolio,  increasing rental rates, development and acquisition of shopping
centers in targeted markets, and redevelopment of existing shopping centers.



        The  following  table   summarizes  the  four  largest  grocery  tenants
        occupying Regency's shopping centers at December 31, 2000:



(a)     Includes tenant owned stores
(b)     Includes properties owned through joint ventures


Acquisition and Development of Shopping Centers

        Regency  has  implemented  a growth  strategy  dedicated  to  developing
high-quality  shopping  centers.  This development  process can require 12 to 36
months from initial land or redevelopment  acquisition through  construction and
lease-up  and finally  stabilized  income,  depending  upon the size and type of
project.  Generally,  anchor  tenants  begin  operating  their  stores  prior to
construction completion of the entire center,  resulting in rental income during
the  development  phase.  At December  31, 2000,  Regency had 56 projects  under
construction or undergoing major renovations, which when complete will represent
an  investment  of $644.4  million.  Total  cost  necessary  to  complete  these
developments  is  estimated  to be $311.5  million and will be expended  through
2002. These developments are approximately 52% complete and over 50% pre-leased.

        On August  3,  2000,  Regency  acquired  the  non-owned  portion  of two
properties in one joint venture for $2.5 million in cash.  The net assets of the
joint  venture  were  and  continue  to be  consolidated  by  Regency.  Prior to
acquiring  the  non-owned  portion,  the joint  venture  partner's  interest was
reflected  as  limited  partners'  interest  in  consolidated   partnerships  in
Regency's financial statements.

        On June  30,  2000,  Regency  acquired  the  non-owned  portion  of nine
properties  in five joint  ventures,  previously  accounted for using the equity
method,  for $4.4  million  consisting  of cash,  common  stock and Units.  As a
result,  these joint  ventures are wholly owned by Regency and are  consolidated
for financial reporting purposes as of the date of the acquisition.

        On February 28, 1999,  Regency acquired Pacific Retail Trust ("Pacific")
for approximately  $1.157 billion.  At the date of the acquisition,  Pacific was
operating or had under  development 71 retail shopping centers  representing 8.4
million SF of gross leaseable area.  During 1998,  Regency  acquired 43 shopping
centers and joint  ventures  for a total  investment  of $384.3  million  ("1998
Acquisitions")  excluding  contingent  consideration.  During 2000 and 1999, the
Company   paid   contingent   consideration   of  $5  million  and  $9  million,
respectively,  related  to  the  1998  Acquisitions.  No  additional  contingent
consideration is due related to any acquisitions of the Company.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

        Management  anticipates  that cash generated  from operating  activities
will  provide  the  necessary  funds on a  short-term  basis  for its  operating
expenses,  interest  expense and  scheduled  principal  payments on  outstanding
indebtedness,  recurring capital expenditures necessary to properly maintain the
shopping centers, and distributions to share and Unit holders. Net cash provided
by  operating  activities  was $178.5  million and $151.3  million for the years
ended  December  31,  2000 and  1999,  respectively.  Regency  incurred  capital
expenditures   of  $19.1  million  and  $21.5  million  during  2000  and  1999,
respectively. Regency paid scheduled principal payments of $6.2 million and $6.1
million  during  2000  and  1999,  respectively.   Regency  paid  dividends  and
distributions  of  $145.1  million  and  $113.1  million  during  2000 and 1999,
respectively, to its share and Unit holders.

        Management expects to meet long-term liquidity requirements for maturing
debt,  non-recurring  capital  expenditures,  and  acquisition,  renovation  and
development  of shopping  centers from: (i) excess cash generated from operating
activities, (ii) working capital reserves, (iii) additional debt borrowings, and
(iv) additional  equity raised in the private and public markets.  Net cash used
in investing  activities  was $335.3  million and $216.6 million during 2000 and
1999,  respectively,  primarily for the purposes discussed under Acquisition and
Development of Shopping Centers.  Net cash provided by financing  activities was
$203.6 million and $99.5 million during 2000 and 1999,  respectively,  primarily
related to proceeds from the preferred unit and debt offerings  completed during
2000 and 1999 further discussed below.



        During  1999,  the  Board of  Directors  authorized  the  repurchase  of
approximately $65 million of Regency's  outstanding shares through periodic open
market  transactions or privately  negotiated  transactions.  At March 31, 2000,
Regency had completed the program by purchasing 3.25 million shares.

        Regency's outstanding debt at December 31, 2000 and 1999 consists of the
following (in thousands):

                                                        2000         1999

                                                     ============ ============

       Mortgage loans are secured by certain real estate properties, and may be
prepaid, but could be subject to a yield-maintenance premium. Mortgage loans are
generally due in monthly  installments of interest and principal and mature over
various  terms  through  2019.  Variable  interest  rates on mortgage  loans are
currently  based on LIBOR  plus a spread in a range of 125  basis  points to 150
basis points. Fixed interest rates on mortgage loans range from 7.04% to 9.5%.

        During 2000,  Regency modified the terms of its unsecured line of credit
(the "Line") by reducing the  commitment to $625 million and extending the term.
The Line  matures in March  2002,  but may be  extended  annually  for  one-year
periods.  Borrowings  under the Line bear  interest at a variable  rate based on
LIBOR plus 1% (7.875% at  December  31,  2000)  compared  to LIBOR plus a 1.075%
spread (7.575% at December 31, 1999), which is dependent on Regency  maintaining
its investment grade rating.  Regency is required to comply and is in compliance
with certain financial and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured
financing. The Line is used primarily to finance the acquisition and development
of real estate, but is also available for general working capital purposes.

        Subsequent  to December  31,  2000,  Regency  paid down the Line by $265
million  from the  proceeds  of an  unsecured  debt  offering  for $220  million
completed  on  January  22,  2001,  and from the  proceeds  from the sale of two
shopping centers to Columbia Regency Retail Partners, LLC ("Columbia") completed
on December 31, 2000.  Regency currently owns 10% of Columbia with the remaining
90% owned by Columbia  PERFCO  Partners,  L.P.,  an affiliate  of Oregon  Public
Employees  Retirement Fund.  Regency intends to sell three  additional  shopping
centers to Columbia during 2001 upon completion of development.

        On December 15, 2000,  Regency  completed a $10 million  unsecured  debt
offering  with an interest rate of 8.0%.  The notes were priced at 99.375%,  and
are due on December  15,  2010.  On August 29,  2000,  Regency  completed a $150
million  unsecured debt offering with an interest rate of 8.45%.  The notes were
priced at 99.819%,  and are due on September 1, 2010. On April 15, 1999, Regency
completed  $250 million of unsecured  debt offerings with interest rates of 7.4%
to 7.75% due April 1, 2009.  The net  proceeds of these  offerings  were used to
reduce the balance of the Line.

        During 1999,  Regency  assumed debt with a fair value of $402.6  million
related to the acquisition of real estate,  which included debt premiums of $4.1
million based upon the above market interest rates of the debt instruments. Debt
premiums are amortized over the terms of the related debt instruments.

        In May and September 2000, Regency issued $70 million and $24 million of
8.75%  Series  E  and  Series  F  Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Units  (the
"Preferred  Units"),   respectively.  The  issues  were  sold  to  institutional
investors in private placements for $100.00 per unit. The Preferred Units, which
may be called by the  Partnership  at par on or after  May and  September,  2005
respectively,  have  no  stated  maturity  or  mandatory  redemption,  and pay a
cumulative, quarterly dividend at an annualized rate of 8.75%. At any time after
10 years from the date of issuance,  the  Preferred  Units may be exchanged  for
8.75% Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock") at an exchange
rate of one share for one unit.  The Preferred  Units and the related  Preferred
Stock are not  convertible  into common  stock of Regency.  The net  proceeds of
these  offerings  were used to reduce the Line. In 1999,  Regency issued similar
preferred  units in several series in the amount of $210 million with an average
fixed  distribution rate of 8.93%. At December 31, 2000, the face value of total
preferred units issued was $384 million with an average fixed  distribution rate
of 8.72% vs. $290 million with an average  fixed  distribution  rate of 8.71% at
December 31, 1999.



        As of December 31, 2000, scheduled principal repayments on notes payable
and the Line were as follows (in thousands):

                                          Scheduled

        Unconsolidated  partnerships  and  joint  ventures  had  mortgage  loans
payable of $14.3 million at December 31, 2000, and Regency's proportionate share
of these loans was $5.9 million.

        Regency believes it qualifies and intends to qualify as a REIT under the
Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, Regency is allowed to reduce taxable income by
all or a portion of its  distributions  to stockholders.  As distributions  have
exceeded  taxable  income,  no provision for federal income taxes has been made.
While Regency intends to continue to pay dividends to its stockholders,  it also
will reserve such amounts of cash flow as it considers  necessary for the proper
maintenance  and  improvement of its real estate,  while still  maintaining  its
qualification as a REIT.

        Regency's real estate portfolio has grown substantially during 2000 as a
result of the development  activity discussed above. Regency intends to continue
to acquire and develop shopping centers in the near future,  and expects to meet
the related capital requirements from borrowings on the Line. Regency expects to
repay the Line from time to time from  additional  public and private  equity or
debt offerings,  such as those completed in previous years.  Because acquisition
and development activities are discretionary in nature, they are not expected to
burden   Regency's   capital   resources   currently   available  for  liquidity
requirements. Regency expects that cash provided by operating activities, unused
amounts  available  under the  Line,  and cash  reserves  are  adequate  to meet
liquidity requirements.

Results from Operations

Comparison 2000 to 1999

        Revenues  increased  $59.7 million or 20% to $361.6 million in 2000. The
increase was due primarily to the Pacific  acquisition which did not occur until
February  28,  1999,  revenues  from  newly  completed  developments  that  only
partially  operated  during 1999,  and from growth in rental rates and occupancy
levels at the operating properties. Minimum rent increased $38.2 million or 18%,
and  recoveries  from tenants  increased  $13.8  million or 25%. At December 31,
2000,  Regency  was  operating  or  developing  242  shopping  centers.  Regency
identifies its shopping centers as either  development  properties or stabilized
properties.  Development  properties  are defined as properties  that are in the
construction  and  initial  lease-up  process  that are not yet 93%  leased  and
occupied.   Stabilized   properties   are  all   properties  not  identified  as
development.  At December 31, 2000, Regency had 194 stabilized  shopping centers
that were 95.3%  leased.  At December  31,  1999,  these  properties  were 94.2%
leased.  In 2000,  rental  rates grew by 8% from  renewal  leases and new leases
replacing previously occupied spaces in the stabilized properties.

        Service  operations  revenue  includes fees earned in Regency's  service
operations  segment which includes property  management and leasing  commissions
earned  from third  parties,  and  development  profits  earned from the sale of
shopping centers, build to suit properties,  and land to third parties.  Service
operations  revenue  increased by $9.0 million to $27.2 million in 2000, or 49%.
The  increase  was  primarily  due to a $11.1  million  increase in  development
profits offset by a $2.1 million  reduction in property  management fees. During
2000 Regency  continued to reduce the portfolio of properties  managed for third
party owners.

        Operating  expenses  increased $27.8 million or 20% to $163.6 million in
2000. Combined operating and maintenance,  and real estate taxes increased $14.8
million or 22% during 2000 to $82.3  million.  The increase was primarily due to
the Pacific acquisition,  expenses incurred by newly completed developments that
only partially operated during 1999, and general increases in operating expenses
on the stabilized  properties.  General and  administrative  expenses were $19.9
million  during  2000 vs.  $19.3  million  in 1999 or 3%  higher  as a result of
general  salary  and  benefit  increases,  and  new  employees  hired  in  2000.
Depreciation  and  amortization  increased  $10.8  million  during  2000  or 22%
primarily due to the Pacific  acquisition and  developments  that only partially
operated during 1999.



        Periodically,  Regency  identifies  shopping centers that no longer meet
its long-term investment standards, such as expected growth in revenue or market
dominance.   Once  identified  and  marketed  for  sale,  these  properties  are
segregated on the balance sheet as operating  properties held for sale.  Regency
also develops  shopping centers and stand-alone  retail stores for resale.  Once
completed, these developments are also included in operating properties held for
sale.  Operating  properties  held for sale are  carried at the lower of cost or
fair value less  estimated  selling costs.  Depreciation  and  amortization  are
suspended  during the period held for sale.  During 2000 Regency  entered into a
contract  to sell  seven  shopping  centers  for $74.6  million  and  recorded a
provision for loss on operating properties held for sale of $13.0 million.

        Interest  expense  increased to $72.0 million in 2000 from $60.1 million
in 1999 or 20%. The increase was  primarily  due to the  assumption of debt from
the Pacific  acquisition,  and higher  interest  costs  related to interest rate
increases on  outstanding  debt balances  including the unsecured debt offerings
completed in 2000 and 1999.

        Preferred unit  distributions  increased  $17.2 million to $29.6 million
during 2000 as a result of the preferred units issued in 2000 and 1999.  Average
fixed  distribution rates of the preferred units were 8.72% at December 31, 2000
vs. 8.71% at December 31, 1999.

        Net income for common  stockholders  was $84.8 million in 2000 vs. $87.6
million in 1999,  or a 3%  decrease.  The decline was  primarily a result of the
provision for loss on operating properties held for sale and increased preferred
unit  distributions,  net of the acquisition and development  activity described
above.  Diluted  earnings per share was $1.49 in 2000 vs. $1.61 in 1999, or 7.5%
lower as a result of the decrease in net income.

Comparison 1999 to 1998

        Revenues increased $158.6 million or 111% to $301.9 million in 1999. The
increase was due  primarily to the Pacific and the 1998  Acquisitions  providing
increases  in revenues of $143.9  million  during 1999.  Minimum rent  increased
$114.7 million or 111%, and recoveries  from tenants  increased $31.8 million or
132%. At December 31, 1999,  Regency was  operating or  developing  216 shopping
centers of which 190 were stabilized  properties.  These  stabilized  properties
were 95% leased at December 31, 1999,  and 93.6% leased at December 31, 1998. On
a same property basis (excluding Pacific, the 1998 Acquisitions, and four office
buildings sold during 1998) gross rental revenues  increased $8.9 million or 8%,
primarily  due to higher base  rents.  In 1999,  rental  rates grew by 7.8% from
renewal  leases  and new  leases  replacing  previously  occupied  spaces in the
stabilized properties.

        Service operations revenue increased by $6.3 million to $18.2 million in
1999,  or 53%.  The  increase was  primarily  due to a $8.8 million  increase in
development  profits offset by a $2.5 million  reduction in property  management
fees.  During 1999,  Regency  significantly  reduced the portfolio of properties
managed on behalf of third party owners.

        Operating  expenses  increased $64.9 million or 91% to $135.8 million in
1999. Combined operating and maintenance,  and real estate taxes increased $36.6
million or 118% during 1999 to $67.5  million.  The increases are due to Pacific
and the 1998 Acquisitions generating operating and maintenance expenses and real
estate tax  increases of $35.9 million  during 1999.  On a same property  basis,
operating and maintenance  expenses and real estate taxes increased  $879,000 or
3.4%.  General and  administrative  expenses  increased 32% during 1999 to $19.3
million due to the hiring of new employees and related office expenses necessary
to manage the shopping centers  acquired during 1999 and 1998.  Depreciation and
amortization increased $23.6 million during 1999 or 94% primarily due to Pacific
and the 1998 Acquisitions.

        Interest  expense  increased to $60.1 million in 1999 from $28.8 million
in 1998 or 109% due to increased  average  outstanding  loan balances related to
the financing of the 1998  Acquisitions on the Line, the assumption of debt from
the Pacific acquisition and the debt offerings completed in 1999.

        Net income for common  stockholders  was $87.6 million in 1999 vs. $50.6
million  in  1998,  a $37  million  or 73%  increase  primarily  related  to the
acquisition activity discussed. Diluted earnings per share was $1.61 in 1999 vs.
$1.75 in 1998 due to the  increase  in net  income  offset  by the  increase  in
weighted average common shares primarily related to the acquisition of Pacific.



New Accounting Standards and Accounting Changes

        The Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activities, an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 133" ("FAS 138"),
which is effective for all fiscal  quarters of all fiscal years  beginning after
June 15, 2000. FAS 138 and FAS 133 establish  accounting and reporting standards
for derivative  instruments and hedging activities.  FAS 138 and FAS 133 require
entities to recognize all  derivatives  as either assets or  liabilities  in the
balance sheet and measure those  instruments at fair value.  FAS 138 and FAS 133
will have no impact to the  financial  statements  as Regency has no  derivative
instruments.

Environmental Matters

        Regency,  like others in the commercial real estate industry, is subject
to numerous  environmental  laws and regulations.  The operation of dry cleaning
plants at Regency's  shopping  centers is the principal  environmental  concern.
Regency  believes  that the tenants who operate these plants do so in accordance
with current laws and  regulations  and has  established  procedures  to monitor
their operations. Additionally, Regency uses all legal means to cause tenants to
remove dry cleaning plants from its shopping centers.  Where available,  Regency
has applied  and been  accepted  into state  sponsored  environmental  programs.
Regency  has a blanket  environmental  insurance  policy  that covers it against
third party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently
have no known environmental contamination. Regency has also placed environmental
insurance on specific  properties with known  contamination in order to mitigate
its environmental  risk.  Management  believes that the ultimate  disposition of
currently  known  environmental  matters will not have a material  effect on the
financial position, liquidity, or operations of Regency.

Inflation

        Inflation has remained relatively low during 2000 and 1999 and has had a
minimal impact on the operating  performance of the shopping  centers;  however,
substantially all of Regency's  long-term leases contain provisions  designed to
mitigate  the adverse  impact of  inflation.  Such  provisions  include  clauses
enabling  Regency to receive  percentage  rentals based on tenants' gross sales,
which  generally  increase as prices  rise,  and/or  escalation  clauses,  which
generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases.  Such escalation
clauses are often  related to increases  in the consumer  price index or similar
inflation indices.  In addition,  many of Regency's leases are for terms of less
than ten years,  which permits Regency to seek increased rents upon re-rental at
market rates. Most of Regency's leases require the tenants to pay their share of
operating  expenses,  including  common area  maintenance,  real  estate  taxes,
insurance and utilities,  thereby  reducing  Regency's  exposure to increases in
costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.


Item 7a.       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market Risk

        Regency is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its
line of credit and  long-term  debt used to maintain  liquidity and fund capital
expenditures  and expansion of Regency's  real estate  investment  portfolio and
operations.  Regency's  interest rate risk management  objective is to limit the
impact of  interest  rate  changes on  earnings  and cash flows and to lower its
overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives  Regency borrows primarily at
fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest
rate swaps,  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk
on a related financial instrument. Regency has no plans to enter into derivative
or interest rate  transactions  for  speculative  purposes,  and at December 31,
2000,  Regency  did not have any  borrowings  hedged with  derivative  financial
instruments.

        Regency's interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques.
The table below presents the principal amounts maturing (in thousands), weighted
average  interest rates of remaining  debt, and the fair value of total debt (in
thousands), by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and
sensitivity to interest rate changes.






        As the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December
31, 2000, it does not consider those  exposures or positions,  which could arise
after that date.  Moreover,  because firm  commitments  are not presented in the
table above, the information  presented therein has limited predictive value. As
a result, Regency's ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate
fluctuations  will  depend  on the  exposures  that  arise  during  the  period,
Regency's hedging strategies at that time, and interest rates.

                          Independent Auditors' Report


The Shareholders and Board of Directors
Regency Centers Corporation:


We have audited the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets of Regency Centers
Corporation  as of  December  31, 2000 and 1999,  and the  related  consolidated
statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the  three-year  period ended  December 31,  2000.  These  consolidated
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Regency  Centers
Corporation  as of  December  31,  2000  and  1999,  and the  results  of  their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period
ended  December 31, 2000 in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America.

1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

      (a)  Organization and Principles of Consolidation

           The  accompanying   consolidated  financial  statements  include  the
           accounts of Regency Centers  Corporation,  its wholly owned qualified
           REIT subsidiaries,  and its majority owned or controlled subsidiaries
           and  partnerships  (the  "Company"  or  "Regency").  All  significant
           intercompany  balances and  transactions  have been eliminated in the
           consolidated financial statements. The Company owns approximately 98%
           of the outstanding common units of Regency Centers,  L.P., ("RCLP" or
           the "Partnership")  and partnership  interests ranging from 50.01% to
           55%  in  majority  owned  real  estate  partnerships  (the  "Majority
           Partnerships").  The equity  interests of third  parties held by RCLP
           and  the  Majority  Partnerships  are  included  in the  consolidated
           financial   statements   as  preferred  or   exchangeable   operating
           partnership  units  ("Units")  and  limited  partners'   interest  in
           consolidated  partnerships.  The Company is a  qualified  real estate
           investment  trust ("REIT") which began  operations in 1993 as Regency
           Realty Corporation. In February 2001, the Company changed its name to
           Regency Centers Corporation.

       (b) Revenues

           The Company  leases space to tenants  under  agreements  with varying
           terms. Leases are accounted for as operating leases with minimum rent
           recognized  on a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term of the  lease
           regardless  of when  payments are due.  Accrued rents are included in
           tenant  receivables.  Minimum  rent has been  adjusted to reflect the
           effects of recognizing rent on a straight-line basis.

           Substantially  all of the lease agreements  contain  provisions which
           provide  additional rents based on tenants' sales volume  (contingent
           or percentage  rent) or  reimbursement  of the tenants' share of real
           estate taxes and certain common area maintenance  (CAM) costs.  These
           additional  rents are recognized as the tenants achieve the specified
           targets as defined in the lease agreements.

           Service  operations  revenue  includes  property  management fees and
           leasing  commissions  earned  from  third  parties,  and  development
           profits from the sale of shopping centers,  build to suit properties,
           and land to third parties.

                           REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                                December 31, 2000


      (c)  Real Estate Investments

           Land, buildings and improvements are recorded at cost. All direct and
           indirect costs clearly  associated with the acquisition,  development
           and construction of real estate projects are capitalized as buildings
           and improvements.

           Maintenance  and  repairs  which do not  improve or extend the useful
           lives  of the  respective  assets  are  reflected  in  operating  and
           maintenance expense. The property cost includes the capitalization of
           interest  expense  incurred  during  construction  based  on  average
           outstanding expenditures.

           Depreciation   is  computed  using  the  straight  line  method  over
           estimated  useful  lives  of up to  forty  years  for  buildings  and
           improvements,  term of lease for  tenant  improvements,  and three to
           seven years for furniture and equipment.

           Operating  properties held for sale include properties that no longer
           meet the Company's  long-term  investment  standards such as expected
           growth in revenue or market  dominance.  Once identified and marketed
           for sale,  these  properties  are  segregated on the balance sheet as
           operating  properties  held  for  sale.  The  Company  also  develops
           shopping  centers and  stand-alone  retail  stores for  resale.  Once
           completed,   these   developments  are  also  included  in  operating
           properties  held for  sale.  Operating  properties  held for sale are
           carried  at the lower of cost or fair value  less  estimated  selling
           costs.  Depreciation and amortization are suspended during the period
           held for sale. At December 31, 2000, the Company had seven properties
           under contract for sale for $74.6  million,  and recorded a provision
           for loss on the sale of $13.0 million. The results of operations from
           these seven  properties  was $6.8 million for the year ended December
           31, 2000.

           The  Company  reviews  its real  estate  investments  for  impairment
           whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the
           carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

      (d)  Income Taxes

           The Company  believes it qualifies and intends to continue to qualify
           as a REIT under the Internal  Revenue Code (the  "Code").  As a REIT,
           the Company is allowed to reduce  taxable  income by all or a portion
           of its distributions to stockholders.  As distributions have exceeded
           taxable  income,  no provision for federal income taxes has been made
           in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

           Earnings and profits,  which determine the taxability of dividends to
           stockholders, differ from net income reported for financial reporting
           purposes  primarily  because of different  depreciable lives and cost
           bases of the shopping centers, and other timing differences.


                                       F-10




                           REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                                December 31, 2000


      (d)  Income Taxes (continued)

           In July 2000, two subsidiaries of the Company,  Regency Realty Group,
           Inc., ("RRG") and PRT Development  Corporation  ("PRTDC") merged with
           RRG being the surviving  entity.  RRG is subject to federal and state
           income  taxes  and  files  separate  tax  returns.   RRG,   including
           historical  amounts  of PRTDC,  had  taxable  income  of  $2,245,101,
           $5,029,438,  and $774,756 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999
           and 1998, respectively.  RRG incurred federal and state income tax of
           $890,318,   $2,011,629   and   $223,657  in  2000,   1999  and  1998,
           respectively.

           The Company and RRG plan to jointly  elect for RRG to be treated as a
           Taxable  REIT  Subsidiary  of the  Company as such term is defined in
           Section 856(l) of the Code. Such election, if made, will be effective
           for the tax year  beginning  January 1, 2001,  and is not expected to
           impact the tax treatment of either the Company or RRG.

           At  December  31,  2000 and 1999,  the net book basis of real  estate
           assets exceeds the tax basis by  approximately  $170 million and $197
           million,  respectively,  primarily due to the difference  between the
           cost basis of the assets  acquired and their carryover basis recorded
           for tax purposes.

           The following  summarizes the tax status of dividends paid during the
           years ended December 31 (unaudited):

                                             2000         1999         1998
                                             ----         ----         ----

               Dividend per share      $     1.92         1.84           1.76

      (e)  Deferred Costs

           Deferred  costs  include  deferred  leasing  costs and deferred  loan
           costs, net of amortization. Such costs are amortized over the periods
           through lease  expiration or loan  maturity.  Deferred  leasing costs
           consist of internal and external commissions  associated with leasing
           the Company's  shopping  centers.  Deferred  leasing costs were $15.3
           million and $7.1 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
           Deferred loan costs consists of initial direct and incremental  costs
           associated with financing  activities.  Deferred loan costs were $6.0
           million and $5.4 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

                                December 31, 2000


      (f)  Earnings Per Share

           Basic net income per share of common stock is computed based upon the
           weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
           Diluted net income per share also includes  common share  equivalents
           for  stock  options,   exchangeable   operating   partnership  units,
           preferred stock,  and Class B common stock when dilutive.  See note 7
           for the calculation of earnings per share.

      (g)  Cash and Cash Equivalents

           Any  instruments  which have an  original  maturity of ninety days or
           less when purchased are considered cash equivalents.

      (h)  Estimates

           The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
           principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America
           requires the Company's  management to make estimates and  assumptions
           that  affect the  reported  amounts of assets  and  liabilities,  and
           disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities,  at the date of the
           financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and
           expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results could differ
           from those estimates.

      (i)  Stock Option Plan

           The Company  applies the provisions of SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting for
           Stock Based  Compensation",  which  allows  companies a choice in the
           method of  accounting  for stock  options.  Entities may recognize as
           expense  over the  vesting  period the fair value of all  stock-based
           awards on the date of grant or  continue to apply the  provisions  of
           APB  Opinion  No. 25 and  provide  pro forma net income and pro forma
           earnings per share  disclosures for employee stock option grants made
           as if the  fair-value-based  method  defined in SFAS No. 123 had been
           applied.   APB  Opinion  No.  25  "Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to
           Employees"  and  related   interpretations  state  that  compensation
           expense  would be  recorded  on the date of grant only if the current
           market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. The
           Company  has  elected  to  continue  to apply the  provisions  of APB
           Opinion  No. 25 and provide the pro forma  disclosure  provisions  of
           SFAS No. 123.

2.    Acquisitions of Shopping Centers

      On August 3, 2000,  the  Company  acquired  the  non-owned  portion of two
      properties in one joint  venture for $2.5 million in cash.  The net assets
      of the joint venture were and continue to be  consolidated by the Company.
      Prior to acquiring the  non-owned  portion,  the joint  venture  partner's
      interest  was  reflected  as limited  partners'  interest in  consolidated
      partnerships in the Company's financial statements.

      On  February  28,  1999,  the  Company   acquired   Pacific  Retail  Trust
      ("Pacific") for  approximately  $1.157 billion.  The operating  results of
      Pacific are included in the Company's  consolidated  financial  statements
      from the date each  property was  acquired.  The  following  unaudited pro
      forma  information  presents the consolidated  results of operations as if
      the acquisition of Pacific had occurred on January 1, 1999. Such pro forma
      information  reflects  adjustments to 1) increase  depreciation,  interest
      expense,  and general and administrative  costs and 2) adjust the weighted
      average common shares and common equivalent shares  outstanding  issued to
      acquire the properties.  Pro forma revenues would have been $324.7 million
      as of  December  31,  1999.  Pro forma net income for common  stockholders
      would have been $94.1 million as of December 31, 1999. Pro forma basic net
      income per share and pro forma  diluted  net  income per share  would have
      been $1.58 and $1.58,  respectively,  as of December 31,  1999.  This data
      does not  purport to be  indicative  of what would have  occurred  had the
      Pacific  acquisition been made on January 1, 1999, or of results which may
      occur in the future.

      During 2000 and 1999,  the Company  paid  contingent  consideration  of $5
      million and $9 million,  respectively,  related to the  acquisition  of 43
      shopping  centers and joint ventures  acquired  during 1998. No additional
      contingent  consideration  is  due  related  to  any  acquisitions  of the
      Company.

3.    Segments

      The Company  was formed,  and  currently  operates,  for the purpose of 1)
      operating and developing  Company owned retail  shopping  centers  (Retail
      segment),  and 2) providing  services  including  property  management and
      commissions earned from third parties, and development related profits and
      fees  earned  from  the  sales  of  shopping  centers  and  build  to suit
      properties to third parties (Service operations segment).  The Company had
      previously  operated  four  office  buildings  that were sold  during 1998
      (Office  buildings  segment).  The  Company's  reportable  segments  offer
      different  products or services  and are managed  separately  because each
      requires  different  strategies  and  management  expertise.  There are no
      material inter-segment sales or transfers.

      The Company  assesses and measures  operating  results  starting  with net
      operating income for the Retail and Office  Buildings  segments and income
      for the  Service  operations  segment and  converts  such  amounts  into a
      performance  measure  referred to as Funds From  Operations  ("FFO").  The
      operating  results for the individual  retail  shopping  centers have been
      aggregated  since all of the Company's  shopping  centers  exhibit  highly
      similar economic  characteristics  as neighborhood  shopping centers,  and
      offer similar degrees of risk and opportunities for growth. FFO as defined
      by the National  Association of Real Estate  Investment Trusts consists of
      net income  (computed in accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
      principles)  excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales
      of income producing  property held for investment,  plus  depreciation and
      amortization  of  real  estate,   and   adjustments   for   unconsolidated
      investments in real estate  partnerships  and joint ventures.  The Company
      further  adjusts  FFO by  distributions  made  to  holders  of  Units  and
      preferred  stock  that  results  in a  diluted  FFO  amount.  The  Company
      considers  diluted  FFO to be the  industry  standard  for  reporting  the
      operations of real estate  investment  trusts  ("REITs").  Adjustments for
      investments in real estate  partnerships are calculated to reflect diluted
      FFO on the same basis.  While management  believes that diluted FFO is the
      most relevant and widely used measure of the Company's  performance,  such
      amount  does not  represent  cash  flow  from  operations  as  defined  by
      generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  should not be  considered an
      alternative  to net  income as an  indicator  of the  Company's  operating
      performance, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow
      needs. Additionally, the Company's calculation of diluted FFO, as provided
      below, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs.

      The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
      note 1. The revenues,  diluted FFO, and assets for each of the  reportable
      segments are  summarized as follows for the years ended December 31, 2000,
      1999, and 1998.  Assets not  attributable to a particular  segment consist
      primarily of cash and deferred costs.

4.    Investments in Real Estate Partnerships

      The Company  accounts for all  investments  in which it owns less than 50%
      and does not have controlling  financial interest using the equity method.
      The Company's combined  investment in these partnerships was $85.2 million
      and $66.9 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Net income
      is allocated to the Company in accordance with the respective  partnership
      agreements.  On June 30, 2000, the Company acquired the non-owned  portion
      of nine joint ventures,  previously accounted for using the equity method,
      for $4.4 million  consisting of cash, common stock and Units. As a result,
      these joint ventures are  wholly-owned by the Company and are consolidated
      for financial reporting purposes as of the date of acquisition.

      On December 31,  2000,  the Company  contributed  $4.5 million to Columbia
      Regency  Retail  Partners,  LLC  ("Columbia")  representing  a 10%  equity
      interest.  The  remaining  90% of  Columbia  is owned by  Columbia  PERFCO
      Partners,  L.P., an affiliate of Oregon Public Employees  Retirement Fund.
      Columbia  was formed  for the  purpose of  investing  in grocery  anchored
      shopping centers.

5.    Notes Payable and Unsecured Line of Credit

      The Company's  outstanding  debt at December 31, 2000 and 1999 consists of
      the following (in thousands):

                                                           2000         1999

                                                       ============ ============

      On December 15, 2000, the Company,  through RCLP,  completed a $10 million
      unsecured  private debt offering with an interest rate of 8.0%.  The notes
      were priced at 99.375%, are due on December 15, 2010 and are guaranteed by
      the Company.  On August 29, 2000, the Company,  through RCLP,  completed a
      $150 million  unsecured debt offering with an interest rate of 8.45%.  The
      notes  were  priced  at  99.819%,  are due on  September  1,  2010 and are
      guaranteed by the Company.  The net proceeds of the offerings were used to
      reduce the balance of the unsecured line of credit (the "Line").

5.    Notes Payable and Unsecured Line of Credit (continued)

      In July 2000,  the Company  modified the terms of its Line by reducing the
      commitment  to $625  million.  The Line matures in March 2002,  but may be
      extended  annually for one-year  periods.  Borrowings  under the Line bear
      interest  at a variable  rate  based on LIBOR plus a 1% spread  (7.875% at
      December  31,  2000)  compared  to LIBOR plus a 1.075%  spread  (7.575% at
      December  31,  1999),  and is  dependent  on the Company  maintaining  its
      investment  grade  rating.  The  Company is  required  to comply and is in
      compliance with certain financial and other covenants  customary with this
      type of  unsecured  financing.  The Line is used  primarily to finance the
      acquisition  and  development  of real estate,  but is also  available for
      general working capital purposes.

      Subsequent  to December 31,  2000,  the Company paid down the Line by $265
      million from the proceeds of an unsecured  debt  offering for $220 million
      completed on January 22, 2001,  and from the proceeds from the sale of two
      shopping centers to Columbia completed on December 31, 2000.

      Mortgage loans are secured by certain real estate  properties,  and may be
      prepaid,  but could be subject to a  yield-maintenance  premium.  Mortgage
      loans are generally due in monthly  installments of interest and principal
      and mature over various  terms through 2019.  Variable  interest  rates on
      mortgage  loans are  currently  based on LIBOR plus a spread in a range of
      125 basis points to 150 basis  points.  Fixed  interest  rates on mortgage
      loans range from 7.04% to 9.5%.

      During 1999, the Company  assumed debt with a fair value of $402.6 million
      related to the acquisition of real estate, which included debt premiums of
      $4.1  million  based  upon the  above  market  interest  rates of the debt
      instruments.  Debt  premiums are  amortized  over the terms of the related
      debt instruments.

      On April 15, 1999,  the Company,  through  RCLP,  completed a $250 million
      unsecured  debt offering in two tranches.  The Company issued $200 million
      7.4% notes due April 1, 2004,  priced at 99.922% to yield  7.42%,  and $50
      million 7.75% notes due April 1, 2009, priced at 100%. The net proceeds of
      the offering were used to reduce the balance of the Line.

      As of December 31, 2000,  scheduled principal  repayments on notes payable
      and the Line were as follows (in thousands):

                                            Scheduled

5.    Notes Payable and Unsecured Line of Credit (continued)

      Unconsolidated  partnerships and joint ventures had mortgage loans payable
      of $14.3  million at December 31, 2000,  and the  Company's  proportionate
      share of these loans was $5.9 million.

      The fair value of the Company's notes payable and Line are estimated based
      on the  current  rates  available  to the  Company  for  debt of the  same
      remaining  maturities.  Variable  rate notes  payable,  and the Line,  are
      considered  to  be  at  fair  value  since  the  interest  rates  on  such
      instruments reprice based on current market conditions. Notes payable with
      fixed rates, that have been assumed in connection with  acquisitions,  are
      recorded in the  accompanying  financial  statements  at fair  value.  The
      Company considers the carrying value of all other fixed rate notes payable
      to be a reasonable  estimation  of their fair value based on the fact that
      the rates of such notes are similar to rates  available to the Company for
      debt of the same terms.

6.    Stockholders' Equity and Minority Interest

      In May and September  2000, the Company issued $70 million and $24 million
      of 8.75% Series E and Series F Cumulative  Redeemable Preferred Units (the
      "Preferred  Units"),  respectively.  The issues were sold to institutional
      investors in private placements for $100.00 per unit. The Preferred Units,
      which  may be  called  by the  Partnership  at par  on or  after  May  and
      September  2005,  respectively,  have  no  stated  maturity  or  mandatory
      redemption, and pay a cumulative, quarterly dividend at an annualized rate
      of  8.75%.  At any  time  after 10 years  from the date of  issuance,  the
      Preferred Units may be exchanged for 8.75% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
      Stock  ("Preferred  Stock") at an exchange rate of one share for one unit.
      The Preferred  Units and the related  Preferred  Stock are not convertible
      into common stock of the Company. The net proceeds of these offerings were
      used to reduce the Line. In 1999,  the Company  issued  similar  preferred
      units in  several  series in the  amount of $210  million  with an average
      fixed  distribution rate of 8.93%. At December 31, 2000, the face value of
      total  preferred  units  issued was $384  million  with an  average  fixed
      distribution  rate  of  8.72%  vs.  $290  million  with an  average  fixed
      distribution rate of 8.71% at December 31, 1999.

      Terms and conditions of the Preferred Units are summarized as follows:

6.    Stockholders' Equity and Minority Interest (continued)

      As part of the  acquisition  of Pacific,  the Company  issued Series 1 and
      Series 2  preferred  stock.  During  1999,  a holder of Series 2 preferred
      stock  converted  all of their shares into 14,987  shares of common stock.
      During 2000,  the remaining  Series 1 preferred  stock was converted  into
      537,107 shares of Series 2 preferred  stock.  Series 2 preferred  stock is
      convertible  into  common  stock  on a  one-for-one  basis.  The  Series 2
      preferred shares are entitled to quarterly dividends in an amount equal to
      the  common  dividend  and are  cumulative.  The  Company  may  redeem the
      preferred  stock any time after  October 20, 2010 at a price of $20.83 per
      share, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends.

      During  1999,  the  Board  of  Directors   authorized  the  repurchase  of
      approximately  $65 million of the  Company's  outstanding  shares  through
      periodic open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions. At
      March 31, 2000,  the Company had completed the program by purchasing  3.25
      million shares.

      During  1999,  2,500,000  shares of Class B common  stock  converted  into
      2,975,468 shares of common stock.

      On June 11, 1996, the Company entered into a Stockholders Agreement with a
      subsidiary of Security  Capital  Group  Incorporated  ("SCG")  granting it
      certain rights such as purchasing common stock, nominating representatives
      to the  Company's  Board  of  Directors,  and  subjecting  SCG to  certain
      restrictions including voting and ownership  restrictions.  In conjunction
      with the  acquisition  of Pacific in 1999,  SCG  exchanged  their  Pacific
      shares for 22.6 million Regency common shares.

7.    Earnings Per Share

      The following summarizes the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per
      share for the years ended  December 31, 2000,  1999 and 1998 (in thousands
      except per share data):




        The Series 1 and Series 2 preferred stock and the Class B common  stock
        are not  included in the above  calculation  because  their  effects are
        anti-dilutive.

8.    Long-Term Stock Incentive Plans

      In 1993,  the  Company  adopted a  Long-Term  Omnibus  Plan  (the  "Plan")
      pursuant to which the Board of Directors may grant stock and stock options
      to officers,  directors and other key employees. The Plan provides for the
      issuance of up to 12% of the Company's  common shares  outstanding  not to
      exceed 8.5 million  shares.  Stock  options  are granted  with an exercise
      price equal to the stock's  fair  market  value at the date of grant.  All
      stock options  granted have ten year terms,  and contain  vesting terms of
      one to five years from the date of grant.

      At December 31, 2000, there were  approximately 2 million shares available
      for grant  under the Plan.  The per share  weighted-average  fair value of
      stock options granted during 2000 and 1999 was $2.18 and $1.23 on the date
      of grant using the Black Scholes  option-pricing  model with the following
      weighted-average   assumptions:  2000  -  expected  dividend  yield  8.1%,
      risk-free interest rate of 6.7%,  expected volatility 20%, and an expected
      life of 6.0 years; 1999 - expected dividend yield 9.2%, risk-free interest
      rate of 5.7%,  expected volatility 21%, and an expected life of 5.3 years.
      The Company  applies APB  Opinion No. 25 in  accounting  for its Plan and,
      accordingly,  no  compensation  cost has  been  recognized  for its  stock
      options in the consolidated financial statements.

      Had the Company  determined  compensation  cost based on the fair value at
      the grant date for its stock options under SFAS No. 123, the Company's net
      income for common  stockholders  would have been  reduced to the pro forma
      amounts indicated below (in thousands except per share data):

      The shopping centers' tenant base includes primarily national and regional
      supermarkets,  drug stores, discount department stores and other retailers
      and, consequently, the credit risk is concentrated in the retail industry.
      There were no tenants which  individually  represented  10% or more of the
      Company's combined minimum rent.

10.   Contingencies

      The  Company,  like  others in the  commercial  real estate  industry,  is
      subject to numerous  environmental laws and regulations.  The operation of
      dry cleaning  plants at the  Company's  shopping  centers is the principal
      environmental  concern.  The Company believes that the tenants who operate
      these plants do so in accordance with current laws and regulations and has
      established  procedures to monitor  their  operations.  Additionally,  the
      Company  uses all legal  means to cause  tenants  to remove  dry  cleaning
      plants from its shopping centers. Where available, the Company has applied
      and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs. The Company
      has a blanket environmental  insurance policy that covers it against third
      party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently
      have no known  environmental  contamination.  The  Company has also placed
      environmental insurance on specific properties with known contamination in
      order to mitigate its  environmental  risk.  Management  believes that the
      ultimate  disposition of currently  known  environmental  matters will not
      have a material effect on the financial position, liquidity, or operations
      of the Company.  At December  31, 2000 and 1999,  the Company had recorded
      environmental liabilities of $2.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively.

 11.  Market and Dividend Information (Unaudited)
