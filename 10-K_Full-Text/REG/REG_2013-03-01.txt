EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2012

of Regency Centers Corporation and Regency Centers, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Regency Centers Corporation” or the “Parent Company” mean Regency Centers Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries; and references to “Regency Centers, L.P.” or the “Operating Partnership” mean Regency Centers, L.P. and its controlled subsidiaries. The term “the Company” or “Regency” means the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, collectively.

The Parent Company is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and the general partner of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units (“Units”). As of

December 31, 2012

, the Parent Company owned approximately

99.8%

of the Units in the Operating Partnership and the remaining limited Units are owned by investors. The Parent Company owns all of the Series 6 and 7 Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.

The Company believes combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:

•

enhances investors' understanding of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;

•

eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation; and

•

creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

Management operates the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of the Parent Company consists of the same individuals as the management of the Operating Partnership. These individuals are officers of the Parent Company and employees of the Operating Partnership.

The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. The Parent Company is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Parent Company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company does not hold any indebtedness, but guarantees all of the unsecured public debt and approximately

18%

of the secured debt of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds all the assets of the Company and retains the ownership interests in the Company's joint ventures. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by the Parent Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company's business. These sources include the Operating Partnership's operations, its direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of partnership units.

Stockholders' equity, partners' capital, and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units, as well as Series 6 and 7 Preferred Units owned by the Parent Company. The limited partners' units in the Operating Partnership owned by third parties are accounted for in partners' capital in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and outside of stockholders' equity in noncontrolling interests in the Parent Company's financial statements. The Series 6 and 7 Preferred Units owned by the Parent Company are eliminated in consolidation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and are classified as preferred units of general partner in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership.

In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, there are sections in this report that separately discuss the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, including separate financial statements, controls and procedures sections, and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure for the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company.

As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, while stockholders' equity and partners' capital differ as discussed above, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.


Forward-Looking Statements

In addition to historical information, the following information contains forward-looking statements as defined under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements include statements about potential changes in our revenues, the size of our development program, earnings per share and unit, returns and portfolio value, and expectations about our liquidity. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the real estate industry and markets in which the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, collectively “Regency” or “the Company”, operate, and management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in national and local economic conditions; financial difficulties of tenants; competitive market conditions, including timing and pricing of acquisitions and sales of properties and out-parcels; changes in leasing activity and market rents; timing of development starts; meeting development schedules; our inability to exercise voting control over the co-investment partnerships through which we own many of our properties; consequences of any armed conflict or terrorist attack against the United States; and the ability to obtain governmental approvals. We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revision to such forward-looking statements to reflect events or uncertainties after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of uncertain events. For additional information, see “Risk Factors” elsewhere herein. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto of Regency Centers Corporation and Regency Centers, L.P. appearing elsewhere herein.

PART I

Item 1.    Business

Regency Centers Corporation began its operations as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") in 1993 and is the managing general partner in Regency Centers, L.P.  We endeavor to be the preeminent, best-in-class national shopping center company distinguished by sustaining growth in shareholder value and compounding total shareholder return in excess of our peers.  We work to achieve these goals through reliable growth in net operating income from a portfolio of dominant, infill shopping centers, balance sheet strength, value-added development capabilities and an engaged team of talented and dedicated people.  All of our operating, investing, and financing activities are performed through the Operating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties (also referred to as "co-investment partnerships" or "joint ventures"). The Parent Company currently owns approximately

99.8%

of the outstanding common partnership units of the Operating Partnership.

At

December 31, 2012

, we directly owned


shopping centers (the “Consolidated Properties”) located in


states representing

22.5 million

square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”).  Through co-investment partnerships, we own partial ownership interests in


shopping centers (the “Unconsolidated Properties”) located in


states and the District of Columbia representing

17.8 million

square feet of GLA.

We earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores, major retail anchors, restaurants, side-shop retailers, and service providers, as well as ground leasing or selling building pads ("out-parcels") to these same types of tenants. Historically, we have experienced growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers.  At

December 31, 2012

, the consolidated shopping centers were

94.1%

leased, as compared to

92.2%

at

December 31, 2011

.

We monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers, especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition, business practice, and store closings in other locations.  We also evaluate consumer preferences, shopping behaviors, and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants.

We grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development. We will continue to use our development capabilities, market presence, and anchor relationships to invest in value-added new development and redevelopments of existing centers. Development is customer driven, meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction. Developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and retailers, resulting in modern shopping centers with long-term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital. This development process typically requires two to three years once construction has commenced, but can vary subject to the size and complexity of the project.  We fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including property sales, equity offerings, and new debt.


Co-investment partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions, as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management, property management, and other investing and financing services. As asset manager, we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating, investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the co-investment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we wholly-own. Co-investment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us.  Although selling properties to co-investment partnerships reduces our direct ownership interest, it provides a source of capital that further strengthens our balance sheet while we continue to share, to the extent of our ownership interest, in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and long-term investment strategy.

We  recognize the importance of continually improving the environmental sustainability performance  of our real estate assets.  To date we have received LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certifications by the U.S. Green Building Council at seven shopping centers and have four additional in-process developments targeting certification.  We also continue to implement best practices in our operating portfolio to reduce our power and water consumption, in addition to other sustainability initiatives. We believe that the design, construction and operation of environmentally efficient shopping centers will contribute to our key strategic goals.

Competition

We are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues, number of properties, gross leasable area, and market capitalization. There are numerous companies and private individuals engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets, including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers. This results in competition for attracting anchor tenants, as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites.  We believe that our competitive advantages are driven by our locations within our market areas, the design and high quality of our shopping centers, the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers, our relationships with our anchor tenants and our side-shop and out-parcel retailers, our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers, and our ability to source and develop new shopping centers.

Employees

Our headquarters are located at One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida. We presently maintain 17 market offices nationwide where we conduct management, leasing, construction, and investment activities. At

December 31, 2012

, we had 368 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Compliance with Governmental Regulations

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of required remediation and the owner's liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral. While we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation, environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to reserves for remediation, insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation, and various state-regulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Risk Factors Related to Our Industry and Real Estate Investments

Downturns in the retail industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow.

Our properties consist primarily of grocery-anchored shopping centers. Our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space.  The market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by any of the following:

•

weakness in the national, regional and local economies, which could adversely impact consumer spending and retail sales and in turn tenant demand for space and lead to increased store closings;

•

adverse financial conditions for grocery and retail anchors;

•

the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector;

•

the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets;

•

reduction in the demand by tenants to occupy our shopping centers as a result of reduced consumer demand for certain retail formats such as video rental stores;

•

a shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to Internet retailers and catalogs;

•

the growth of super-centers and warehouse club retailers, such as those operated by Wal-Mart and Costco, and their adverse effect on traditional grocery chains;

•

the impact of increased energy costs on consumers and its consequential effect on the number of shopping visits to our centers; and

•

consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States.

To the extent that any of these conditions occur, they are likely to impact market rents for retail space, occupancy in the operating portfolios, our ability to sell, acquire or develop properties, and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders.

Our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by poor economic or market conditions where our properties are geographically concentrated, which may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties.

The economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated greatly influence our financial performance.  During the year ended

December 31, 2012

, our properties in California, Florida, and Texas accounted for 30.6%, 11.1%, and 11.0%, respectively, of our net income.  Our revenues and cash available to pay expenses, maintain our properties, and for distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions, such as supply of or demand for retail space, deteriorate in California, Florida, or Texas relative to other geographic areas.

Loss of revenues from significant tenants could reduce distributions to stock and unit holders.

We derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as Kroger, Publix, Safeway and Supervalu, which are our four most significant anchor tenants as they account for

4.3%

,

4.2%

,

3.3%

and

2.1%

respectively, of our total annualized base rent from Consolidated Properties plus our pro-rata share of annualized base rent from Unconsolidated Properties ("pro-rata basis"), which is recognized in equity in income (loss) of investment in real estate partnerships, for the year ended

December 31, 2012

.  Distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a significant tenant:

•

becomes bankrupt or insolvent;

•

experiences a downturn in its business;

•

materially defaults on its leases;

•

does not renew its leases as they expire; or

•

renews at lower rental rates.

Vacated anchor space, including space owned by the anchor, can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant's customer drawing power. Some anchors have the right to vacate and prevent re-tenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term. If significant tenants vacate a property, then other tenants may be entitled to terminate their leases at the property.


Our net income depends on the success and continued occupancy of our tenants.

Our net income could be adversely affected in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of any of our anchors or a significant number of our non-anchor tenants within a shopping center, or if we fail to lease significant portions of our new developments.  The adverse impact on our net income may be greater than the loss of rent from the resulting unoccupied space because co-tenancy clauses in select centers may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations.  Co-tenancy clauses have several variants: they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores; they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration; or more commonly, they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center.

A large percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants and our net income could be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful.

A large percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants (those occupying less than 10,000 square feet).  Smaller shop tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than larger tenants.  The types of smaller shop tenants vary from retail shops to service providers.  If we are unable to attract the right type or mix of smaller shop tenants into our centers, our net income could be adversely impacted.

We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy.

Although minimum rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by that party.

Our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges.

Our long-lived assets, primarily real estate held for investment, are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.  We evaluate whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  Through the evaluation, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold periods, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results.  Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.  To the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.  If such indicators, as described above, are not identified, management will not assess the recoverability of a property's carrying value.

The fair value of real estate assets is highly subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach.   Such cash flow projections consider factors, including expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore are subject to a significant degree of management judgment.  Changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.

These subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income.  There can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets.  Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken.


Adverse global market and economic conditions may adversely affect us and could cause us to recognize additional impairment charges or otherwise harm our performance.

We are unable to predict the timing, severity, and length of adverse market and economic conditions.  Adverse market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses, maintain properties, pay distributions to our stock and unit holders, and refinance debt.  During adverse periods, there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation of our properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in their value.  No assurance can be given that we would be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments in the future.  Our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock.

Our acquisition activities may not produce the returns that we expect.

Our investment strategy includes investing in high-quality shopping centers that are leased to market-dominant grocers, category-leading anchors, specialty retailers, or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities. The acquisition of properties entails risks that include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations:

•

we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we identify;

•

properties we acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we project, at the time we make the decision to invest, which may result in the properties' failure to achieve the returns we projected;

•

our pre-acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired, which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs or decrease cash flow from the property;

•

our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property, may fail to reveal various liabilities, which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition costs;

•

our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short,  either of which could result in the property failing to achieve the returns we have projected, either temporarily or for a longer time; and

•

we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully.

Unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could have a direct impact on our revenues and our revenue growth.

We actively pursue development activities as opportunities arise.  Development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay the development process.  We may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received. We incur other risks associated with development activities, including:

•

the ability to lease developments to full occupancy on a timely basis;

•

the risk that occupancy rates and rents of a completed project will not be sufficient to make the project profitable;

•

the risk that development costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project unprofitable;

•

delays in the development and construction process;

•

the risk that we may abandon development opportunities and lose our investment in these developments;

•

the risk that the current size of our development pipeline will strain the organization's capacity to complete the developments within the targeted timelines and at the expected returns on invested capital; and

•

the lack of cash flow during the construction period.

If our developments are unsuccessful or we experience a slowdown in development activities, our revenue growth and/or operating expenses may be adversely impacted.


We may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or re-leasing space.

We derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants.  We are subject to the risks that, upon expiration or termination of leases, leases for space in our properties may not be renewed, space may not be re-leased, or the terms of renewal or re-lease, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than current lease terms.  As a result, our results of operations and our net income could be adversely impacted.

We may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid.

Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly.  Our inability to respond promptly to unfavorable changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders.

Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business vulnerable to natural disasters and severe weather conditions, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and operating results.

A significant portion of our property gross leasable area is located in areas that are susceptible to the harmful effects of earthquakes, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, and similar natural disasters. As of December 31, 2012, approximately

23.4%

,

14.9%

, and

9.5%

of our property gross leasable area, on a pro-rata basis, was located in California, Florida, and Texas, respectively.  Intense weather conditions during the last decade have caused our cost of property insurance to increase significantly. While much of the cost of this insurance is passed on to our tenants as reimbursable property costs, some tenants do not pay a pro rata share of these costs under their leases. These weather conditions also disrupt our business and the business of our tenants, which could affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of residents to remain in or move to the affected area. Therefore, as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, we face demonstrable risks, including higher costs, such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums, and disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants.

An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance policies on our properties could subject us to loss of capital or revenue on those properties.

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage, rental loss, and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties.  We believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate and consistent with industry standards.  There are, however, some types of losses, such as from hurricanes, terrorism, wars or earthquakes, which may be uninsurable, or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically justifiable.  In addition, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons or damage to personal or real property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted by tenants or their agents on the properties (including without limitation any environmental contamination), and at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. However, our tenants may not properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles associated with such policies.  Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.

Loss of our key personnel could adversely affect the value of our Parent Company's stock price.

We depend on the efforts of our key executive personnel.  Although we believe qualified replacements could be found for our key executives, the loss of their services could adversely affect our Parent Company's stock price.

We face competition from numerous sources, including other real estate investment trusts and small real estate owners.

The ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented.  We face competition from other real estate investment trusts as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition, ownership, and leasing of shopping centers.  We compete to develop shopping centers with other real estate investment trusts engaged in development activities as well as with local, regional, and national real estate developers. If we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets, our cash flow, and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders, may be adversely affected.


Costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders.

Under various federal, state and local laws, an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.  The cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party. The presence of, or the failure to properly remediate, hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to borrow using the property as collateral.  Any of these developments could reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.

Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows.

All of our properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”).  The ADA has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities,” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities.  Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers, and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both.  While the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected. In addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties.  We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements, and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders.

If we do not maintain the security of tenant-related information, we could incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.

We have implemented an online payment system where we receive certain information about our tenants that depends upon secure transmissions of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.  A compromise of our security systems that results in information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties.  In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations.

We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business.

Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems.  Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees.  If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim.  Any material interruption in both of our computer systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

Risk Factors Related to Our Co-investment Partnerships and Acquisition Structure

We do not have voting control over our joint venture investments, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued.

We have invested as a partner in a number of joint venture investments for the acquisition or development of properties.  These investments involve risks not present in a wholly-owned project.  We do not have voting control over the ventures.  The other partner might (i) have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or (ii) otherwise impede our objectives.  The other partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt. These factors could limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates.


The termination of our co-investment partnerships could adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.

If co-investment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason, we would lose the asset and property management fees from these co-investment partnerships, which could adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders.

Risk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital Structure

Higher market capitalization rates for our properties could adversely impact our ability to sell properties and fund developments and acquisitions, and could dilute earnings.

As part of our funding strategy, we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards. These sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments. An increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale, which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated. In order to meet the cash requirements of our development program, we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned, which could have a negative impact on our earnings.

We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.

To qualify as a REIT, the Parent Company must, among other things, distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (excluding any net capital gains).  Because of these distribution requirements, we will likely not be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital for acquisitions or developments, with income from operations. We therefore will have to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings.  Our access to debt depends on our credit rating, the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets.  In addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us, we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our joint ventures are eligible to refinance.

In addition, our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing, such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements.  Additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders' interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage.

Without access to external sources of capital, we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales.  Our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate.  If we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales, we may be forced to reduce the amount of, or eliminate altogether, our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business.

Our debt financing may reduce distributions to stock and unit holders.

Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. In addition, we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due.  If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we might be forced (i) to dispose of properties, which might result in losses, or (ii) to obtain financing at unfavorable terms. Either could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders. If we cannot make required mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage, causing the loss of cash flow from that property.


Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition.

Our unsecured notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants, including compliance with financial ratios, such as ratio of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio.  Fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders.  Our debt arrangements also restrict our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control.  These covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities.  Moreover, if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements, and did not cure the breach within the applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, even in the absence of a payment default.  Many of our debt arrangements, including our unsecured notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured line of credit are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations.  As a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations, and the market value of our stock.

Increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations.

While a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facilities. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt, in addition,  increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures.

This would reduce our future earnings and cash flows, which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders.

Risk Factors Related to Interest Rates and the Market Price for Our Stock

Changes in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the Parent Company's stock price.

The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, many of which are out of our control, including:

•

actual or anticipated variations in our operating results or dividends;

•

changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;

•

publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry in general and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REIT's;

•

the ability of our tenants to pay rent and meet their other obligations to us under current lease terms and our ability to re-lease space as leases expire;

•

increases in market interest rates that drive purchasers of our stock to demand a higher dividend yield;

•

changes in market valuations of similar companies;

•

adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;

•

any future issuances of equity securities;

•

additions or departures of key management personnel;

•

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;

•

actions by institutional stockholders;

•

speculation in the press or investment community; and

•

general market and economic conditions.

These factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects.  It is impossible to ensure that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future. A decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets. Selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders.


Risk Factors Related to Federal Income Tax Laws

If the Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.

We believe that we qualify for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT.  If we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our stockholders.  Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex.  The determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances, some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation.  For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from specific passive sources, like rent, that are itemized in the REIT tax laws.  There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the REIT requirements.  We are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding capital gains.  The fact that we hold many of our assets through co-investment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements.  Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status.  Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings, that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a REIT.

Also, unless the IRS granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year we first failed to qualify.  If we failed to qualify as a REIT (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we would have to pay significant income taxes, reducing cash available to pay dividends, which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities.  In addition, we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders.  Although we believe that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes.

Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to pay certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.  For example, if we have net income from “prohibited transactions,” that income will be subject to a 100% tax.  In general, prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.  The determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale.  While we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years, we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions, but there can be no assurance that the IRS would not contend otherwise.

Risk Factors Related to Our Ownership Limitations and the Florida Business Corporation Act

Restrictions on the ownership of the Parent Company's capital stock to preserve our REIT status could delay or prevent a change in control.

Ownership of more than 7% by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited, with certain exceptions, by our articles of incorporation, for the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a REIT.  This 7% limitation may discourage a change in control and may also (i) deter tender offers for our capital stock, which offers may be attractive to our stockholders, or (ii) limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7% of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control.

The issuance of the Parent Company's capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control.

Our articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 10,000,000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued.  The issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.  The provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders.

Regency's leases for tenant space under 5,000 square feet generally have terms ranging from three to five years.  Leases greater than 10,000 square feet generally have lease terms in excess of five years, mostly comprised of anchor tenants.  Many of the anchor leases contain provisions allowing the tenant the option of extending the term of the lease at expiration.  The leases provide for the monthly payment in advance of fixed minimum rent, additional rents calculated as a percentage of the tenant's sales, the tenant's pro-rata share of real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance (“CAM”) expenses, and reimbursement for utility costs if not directly metered.

The Company has determined that the dividends paid during


and


on our common stock qualify for the following tax treatment:

As of February 22, 2013, there were approximately 15,000 holders of common equity.

We intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to Regency Centers Corporations' common stockholders. Future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon cash generated by operating activities, our financial condition, capital requirements, annual dividend requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. In order to maintain Regency Centers Corporation's qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are generally required to make annual distributions at least equal to 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year. Under certain circumstances, which we do not expect to occur, we could be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distributions in order to meet such requirements.  The Company has a dividend reinvestment plan under which shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividends automatically in common stock.  Under the plan, the Company may elect to purchase common stock in the open market on behalf of shareholders or may issue new common stock to such shareholders.

Under the loan agreement of our line of credit, in the event of any monetary default, we may not make distributions to stockholders except to the extent necessary to maintain our REIT status.

There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the quarter ended

December 31, 2012

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Regency Centers Corporation began its operations as a REIT in 1993 and is the managing general partner in Regency Centers, L.P.  We endeavor to be the preeminent, best-in-class national shopping center company distinguished by sustaining growth in shareholder value and compounding total shareholder return in excess of our peers.  We work to achieve these goals through reliable growth in net operating income from a portfolio of dominant, infill shopping centers, balance sheet strength, value-added development capabilities and an engaged team of talented and dedicated people. All of our operating, investing, and financing activities are performed through the Operating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties (also referred to as "co-investment partnerships" or "joint ventures"). The Parent Company currently owns approximately

99.8%

of the outstanding common partnership units of the Operating Partnership.

At

December 31, 2012

, we directly owned


shopping centers (the “Consolidated Properties”) located in


states representing

22.5 million

square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”).  Through co-investment partnerships, we own partial ownership interests in


shopping centers (the “Unconsolidated Properties”) located in


states and the District of Columbia representing

17.8 million

square feet of GLA.

We earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores, major retail anchors, restaurants, side-shop retailers, and service providers, as well as by ground leasing or selling building pads ("out-parcels") to these same types of tenants. We experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers.  At

December 31, 2012

, the consolidated shopping centers were

94.1%

leased, as compared to

92.2%

at

December 31, 2011

.

We monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers, especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition, business practice, and store closings in other locations.  We also evaluate consumer preferences, shopping behaviors, and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants.

We grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development. We will continue to use our development capabilities, market presence, and anchor relationships to invest in value-added new developments and redevelopments of existing centers. Development is customer driven, meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction. Developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and retailers, resulting in modern shopping centers with long-term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital. This development process typically requires two to three years once construction has commenced, but can vary subject to the size and complexity of the project.  We fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including property sales, equity offerings, and new debt.

Co-investment partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions, as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management, property management, and other investing and financing services. As asset manager, we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating, investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the co-investment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we wholly-own. Co-investment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us.  Although selling properties to co-investment partnerships reduces our direct ownership interest, it provides a source of capital that further strengthens our balance sheet while we continue to share, to the extent of our ownership interest, in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and long-term investment strategy.


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period. These accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical results, current economic activity, and industry accounting standards. They are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.

Accounts Receivable

Minimum rent, percentage rent, and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are the Company's principal source of revenue.  As a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants.  We are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables.  To address the collectability of these receivables,  we analyze historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts. Although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.

Real Estate Investments

Acquisition of Real Estate Investments

Upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date.   Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. Fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. If, up to one year from the acquisition date, information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis. The Company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred.

We strategically invest in entities that own, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop operating properties. We analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated. If it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities (“VIEs”), we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be VIEs, we do not have voting control, and/or the limited partners (or non-managing members) have substantive participatory rights, then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity. Management uses its judgment when making these determinations.  We use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own 20% or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest, or if we own less than 20% of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence. Under the equity method, we record our investments in and advances to these entities in our consolidated balance sheets, and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.

Development of Real Estate Assets and Cost Capitalization

We capitalize the acquisition of land, the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into properties in development in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy, costs are no longer capitalized.  Other specifically identifiable development costs include pre-development costs essential to the development process, as well as, interest, real estate taxes, and direct employee costs incurred during the development period.  Pre-development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits, legal, engineering, and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center.  At

December 31, 2012

and


, the Company had capitalized pre-development costs of

$3.5 million

and

$2.1 million

, respectively, of which

$2.3 million

and

$1.0 million

, respectively, were refundable deposits.   If we determine it is probable that a specific project undergoing due diligence will not be developed, we immediately expense all


related capitalized pre-development costs not considered recoverable.  During the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


, and


, we expensed pre-development costs of approximately

$1.5 million

,

$241,000

, and

$520,000

, respectively, recorded in other expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended.  We cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after substantial completion of the building shell.  During the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


, and


, we capitalized interest of

$3.7 million

,

$1.5 million

, and $5.1 million, respectively, on our development projects.  We have a staff of employees who directly support our development program.  All direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project.  During the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


, and


, we capitalized

$10.3 million

,

$5.5 million

, and $2.7 million, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program.  The capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring.

Valuation of Real Estate Investments

We evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  If such indicators occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arms length transaction.  If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.  Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.

We evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are  indicators, including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired. An investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an other-than-temporary basis. Cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. We consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary.  These factors include the age of the real estate partnerships, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks. If we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, no impairment charge is recorded. If our analysis indicates that there is an other-than-temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnerships, the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment.

The fair value of real estate investments is highly subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods.   Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore are subject to a significant degree of management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.

The following table summarizes our four most significant tenants, each of which is a grocery retailer, occupying our shopping centers at

December 31, 2012

:


Although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy may have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. We monitor industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties as a result of slowing sales, lack of credit, changes in retail formats or increased competition. As a result of our findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer.

We monitor the financial condition of our tenants. We communicate often with those tenants who have announced store closings or filed bankruptcy. We are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues, and no tenant represents more than 5% of our total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our Parent Company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our Operating Partnership.  The Parent Company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional partnership units.  All debt is issued by our Operating Partnership or by our co-investment partnerships.  On

December 31, 2012

, our cash balance was

$22.3 million

.  We have an $800.0 million Line of Credit commitment (the "Line"), which matures in September 2016, that had an outstanding balance of

$70.0 million

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by

$39.6 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2011

due primarily to increased operating income, driven by higher occupancy, a decrease in interest expense, and timing of cash receipts and payments.

Our dividend distribution policy is set by our Board of Directors who monitor our financial position. Our Board of Directors recently declared our quarterly dividend of $0.4625 per share, paid on February 27, 2013.  Our dividend has remained unchanged since May 2009 and future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability.  We plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes.  We operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our share and unit holders, which were

$70.6 million

and

$2.3 million

, respectively, during the year ended

•

The increase in building improvements and other capital expenditures is due to normal ongoing improvements that may be capitalized for our existing centers.

We plan to continue developing projects for long-term investment purposes and have a staff of employees who directly support our development program.  Internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project.  During the year ended

December 31, 2012

, we capitalized

$3.7 million

of interest expense and

$10.3 million

of internal costs for direct compensation for development and redevelopment activity.  Changes in the level of future development activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development projects that may be capitalized.  A 10% reduction in development activity without a corresponding reduction in the compensation costs directly related to our development activities could result in an additional charge to net income of approximately $859,000.

•

During 2012, we borrowed $250.0 million available under a Term Loan and repaid $150 million using the proceeds from the sale of real estate previously discussed.  Our Term Loan has no remaining borrowing capacity and matures in December 2016.

We endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets.  At

December 31, 2012

, 76.8% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered.  Such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain significant availability on the Line.  Our coverage ratio, including our pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 2.5 times for the year ended

December 31, 2012

as compared to 2.3 times for the year ended

December 31, 2011

.  We define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders.

Through 2013, we estimate that we will require approximately $130.5 million to repay $16.7 million of maturing debt (excluding scheduled principal payments), $110.5 million to complete currently in-process developments and redevelopments, and $3.3 million to fund our pro-rata share of estimated capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships for repayment of debt.  If we start new development or redevelop additional shopping centers, our cash requirements will increase.  At

December 31, 2012

, our joint ventures had

$24.4 million

of scheduled secured mortgage loans and credit lines maturing through 2013.  To meet our cash requirements, we will utilize cash generated from operations, borrowings from our Line, proceeds from the sale of real estate, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of common equity and the issuance of debt.


Investments in Real Estate Partnerships

, respectively. The following table is a summary of unconsolidated combined assets and liabilities of these co-investment partnerships and our pro-rata share at

December 31, 2012

and


(dollars in thousands):

Investments in real estate partnerships are primarily comprised of co-investment partnerships in which we currently invest with six co-investment partners and a closed-end real estate fund (“Regency Retail Partners” or the “Fund”), as further summarized below.  In addition to earning our pro-rata share of net income or loss in each of these co-investment partnerships, we receive recurring market-based fees for asset management, property management, and leasing as well as fees for investment and financing services, which were

$25.4 million

,

$29.0 million

and

$25.1 million

for the years ended

and


we received transaction fees from our co-investment partnerships of

$5.0 million

and

$2.6 million

, respectively, with

no

such fees received during 2012.

Our equity method investments in real estate partnerships as of

December 31, 2012

and


consist of the following (in thousands):


Contractual Obligations

We have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans, unsecured notes, and our unsecured credit facilities as described further below and in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center.  In addition, we have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business.  The table below excludes:

•

Reserves for

$9.3 million

related to our pro-rata share of environmental remediation as discussed herein under

Environmental Matters

as the timing of the remediation payments is not currently known;

•

Obligations related to construction or development contracts, since payments are only due upon satisfactory performance under the contracts;

•

Letters of credit of

$20.8 million

issued to cover performance obligations on certain development projects, which will be satisfied upon completion of the development projects; and

•

Obligations for retirement savings plans due to uncertainty around timing of participant withdrawals, which are solely within the control of the participant, and are further discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following table of Contractual Obligations summarizes our debt maturities including interest, excluding recorded debt premiums or discounts that are not obligations, and our obligations under non-cancelable operating leases, sub-leases, and ground leases as of

December 31, 2012

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our co-investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities, not previously discussed.  Our co-investment partnership properties have been financed with non-recourse loans. The Company has no guarantees related to these loans.


Results from Operations

Comparison of the

year

s ended

December 31, 2012

to


:

Our revenues increased by

$3.8 million

or

0.8%

in


, as compared to


, as summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Minimum rent increased

$9.1 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2011

despite a $13.2 million decrease attributable to the sale of a 15-property portfolio on July 25, 2012.  This portfolio was sold for total consideration of $273.5 million, net of a $47.5 million retained investment in the acquiring real estate partnership.  As of

December 31, 2012

, this asset group did not meet the definition of discontinued operations, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations, based on our continuing involvement.

The increase in minimum rent is due to increased average occupancy levels at our consolidated properties from

92.2%

leased at

December 31, 2011

to

94.1%

leased at

December 31, 2012

, combined with an increase in average base rent per square foot (psf) from $16.59 psf for the year ended

December 31, 2011

to $16.86 psf for the year ended

December 31, 2012

.  Minimum rent also increased $2.9 million due to the acquisition of five operating properties and four development properties since

December 31, 2011

.

Recoveries from tenants represent their  share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers, as well as other income.  Recoveries increased during the year ended

December 31, 2012

as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2011

primarily due to increased average occupancy, although recoveries were partially offset by declines in recovery revenue from the sale of real estate.

We earned fees, at market-based rates, for asset management,  property management, leasing, acquisition, and financing services that we provided to our co-investment partnerships and third parties as follows (in thousands):

The decrease in fees in 2012 was primarily the result of the liquidation of the DESCO co-investment partnership during 2011, which included a $5.0 million disposition fee and a $1.0 million consulting fee we received as a result of the liquidation.  Asset management fees, property management fees, and leasing commissions also declined as a result of the sale of  properties held by our co-investment partnerships since

December 31, 2011

.


Our operating expenses increased by

$3.1 million

or

1.0%

in


, as compared to


. The following table summarizes our operating expenses (in thousands):

Depreciation and amortization expense and operating and maintenance expense decreased

$2.2 million

and

$1.8 million

, respectively, for the year ended

December 31, 2012

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2011

, due to mild winter weather and a net reduction in the number of shopping centers owned during 2012 .  General and administrative expense increased

$5.6 million

primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation expense as a result of exceeding performance targets.

The following table presents the components of other expense (income) (in thousands):

As discussed above, we sold a 15-property portfolio during 2012, and as a result of this sale, we recognized a net impairment loss of $18.1 million during the year ended

December 31, 2012

.  Additional impairment of $56.7 million was recognized related to two operating properties and three land parcels.  The majority of this impairment,

$50.0 million

, related to one operating property, which we determined was more likely than not to be sold before the end of its previously estimated hold period, which led to the impairment.  This property is located in a master planned community of North Los Vegas, a market that was significantly impacted by the housing market crash.  This is the only property owned by us in this market, and we currently do not intend to hold the property for a term that we estimate would be necessary for us to recover our investment. The other operating property exhibited weak operating fundamentals, including low economic occupancy for an extended period of time, which led to a

$4.5 million

impairment.

During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, a $12.4 million provision for impairment was recognized related to two operating properties, that exhibited weak operating fundamentals, including low economic occupancy for an extended period of time, which lead to the impairment.

On

July 20, 2012

, we repaid

$150 million

of our Term Loan, and as a result of this early extinguishment of debt, we expensed approximately

$852,000

in loan costs.

The

$2.3 million

increase in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets from

December 31, 2011

to

December 31, 2012

and is consistent with the change in plan liabilities.


The following table presents the change in net interest expense (in thousands):

Interest on notes payable decreased and interest on unsecured credit facilities increased during the year ended

December 31, 2012

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2011

, as a result of the repayment of $192.4 million of 6.75% unsecured debt in January 2012 using proceeds from our Term Loan and $800 million Line of Credit at lower interest rates.  Additional interest was capitalized during 2012 due to increased development activity.

Our equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships increased by

$14.2 million

in


, as compared to


as follows (in thousands):

The increase in our equity in income (loss) in investments in real estate partnerships for the year ended

December 31, 2012

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2011

, is primarily due to the recognition of our pro-rata share of the $34.5 million gain on sale of an operating property in the Columbia I partnership during second quarter of 2012, the new ownership joint venture interest retained in BRET as part of the portfolio sale during the three months ended

December 31, 2012

, and a $4.6 million impairment recognized on one investment in a real estate partnership during the first quarter of 2011.


The following represents the remaining components to determine net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders for the year ended

December 31, 2012

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2011

(in thousands):

Income tax expense increased

$10.2 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2011

.  During 2012, we identified four core operating properties within the Taxable REIT Subsidiary (“TRS”) and sold them to the REIT, which generated taxable gains enabling us to use a significant amount of the net operating losses created during the portfolio sale from July 2012.  Based on the remaining properties within the TRS and future taxable income sources, the remaining deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized and a full valuation allowance was established on the balance.

Income from discontinued operations was

$23.5 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

and includes

$21.9 million

in gains, net of taxes, from the sale of five properties and the operations of the shopping centers sold.  Income from discontinued operations was

$8.0 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

and includes

$5.9 million

in gains, net of taxes, from the sale of seven properties and the operations, including impairment, of the shopping centers sold.

Gain on sale of real estate decreased approximately

$246,000

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2011

.  During the year ended

December 31, 2012

, we sold seven out-parcels for a gain of $2.2 million, whereas during the year ended

December 31, 2011

, we sold eight out-parcels for no gain, and we sold two operating properties, which did not meet the definition of discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement, for a gain of $2.4 million.

The income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased during the year ended

December 31, 2012

related to the redemption of preferred units in February 2012, resulting in expense recognition of the original preferred unit issuance costs of approximately $842,000 offset by the redemption discount of $1.9 million.

Preferred stock dividends increased

$12.9 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2012

, from

$19.7 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2011

to

$32.5 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2012

.  The increase is attributable to the $9.3 million of non-cash charges for the deemed distribution recognized upon redemption of the Series 3, 4 and 5 Preferred Stock during the year ended

December 31, 2012

, as well as the impact of additional dividends on the Series 6 Preferred Stock issued in February 2012 and Series 7 Preferred Stock issued in September 2012.

Related to our Parent Company's results, our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended

December 31, 2012

was

$6.7 million

, a decrease of

$38.4 million

as compared to net income of

$31.7 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

. The lower net income was primarily related to an increase in impairment provisions of

$62.4 million

, offset by a  decrease in interest expense of

$11.5 million

and an increase in equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships of

$14.2 million

.  Our diluted net loss per share was

$0.08

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

as compared to diluted net income per share of

$0.35

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

.

Related to our Operating Partnership results, our net loss attributable to common unit holders for the year ended

December 31, 2012

was

$6.6 million

, a decrease of

$38.4 million

as compared to net income of

$31.8 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

for the same reasons stated above. Our diluted net loss per unit was

$0.08

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

as compared to diluted net income per unit of

$0.35

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

to


:

Our revenues increased by

$24.9 million

or

5.3%

in


, as compared to


, as summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Minimum rent increased

$18.1 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2010

due to an increase in average base rent per square foot (psf) from $16.55 psf for the year ended

December 31, 2010

to $16.59 psf for the year ended

December 31, 2011

, despite consistent average occupancy levels at our consolidated properties of

92.2%

at

December 31, 2011

and


.  Minimum rent also increased due to the acquisition of two operating properties in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2010, the acquisition of three operating properties during 2011, and four properties received through a distribution-in-kind ("DIK") of one interest in MCWR-DESCO ("DESCO DIK")  in May 2011.

Recoveries from tenants increased as a result of increases in our operating and maintenance expenses, and real estate taxes for the year ended

December 31, 2011

as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2010

as summarized further below.  In addition, other income increased due to increased contingency income earned from prior year sales of $1.4 million.

We earned fees, at market-based rates, for asset management, property management, leasing, acquisition, disposition and financing services that we provided to our co-investment partnerships and third parties as follows (in thousands):

The increase in transaction and other fees was due to the $5.0 million disposition fee and a $1.0 million consulting fee we received as a result of the DESCO DIK liquidation during the the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the $2.6 million disposition fee we received related to GRI's acquisition of Macquarie CountryWide's ("MCW") investment during the year ended December 31, 2010.

. The following table summarizes our operating expenses (in thousands):

Depreciation and amortization expense, operating and maintenance expense, and real estate tax expense increased primarily due to the acquisition of two operating properties in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2010, the acquisition of three operating properties during 2011, and the four properties received through the DESCO DIK in May 2011.  General and administrative expense decreased

$5.4 million

primarily due to a decrease in salary expense, including incentive compensation and certain employee benefits.


The following table presents the components of other expense (income) (in thousands):

During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, a

$12.4 million

provision for impairment was recognized related to two operating properties that exhibited weak operating fundamentals, including low economic occupancy for an extended period of time, which lead to the impairment.

During the year ended

December 31, 2010

, a

$19.9 million

provision for impairment was recognized as a result of identifying properties that had been previously considered held for long term investment and determining that they no longer met our long term investment strategy.  As a result of this re-evaluation, we changed our expected investment holding period and reduced our carrying value to estimated fair value.

On October 29, 2010, RCLP completed a tender offer for outstanding debt by purchasing $11.8 million of its $173.5 million 7.95% unsecured notes maturing in January 2011, and $57.6 million of its $250.0 million 6.75% unsecured notes maturing in January 2012 (collectively, the “Notes”).  The Company recognized a $4.2 million expense for the early extinguishment of this debt.

The

$2.2 million

increase in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets from

December 31, 2010

to

December 31, 2011

and is consistent with the change in plan liabilities.

The following table presents the change in interest expense (in thousands):

Interest on notes payable decreased during the year ended

December 31, 2011

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2010

, as a result of the repayment of $161.7 million and $20.0 million of unsecured debt in January 2011 and December 2011, respectively.  Capitalized interest decreased as a result of reduced development activity during the year ended

December 31, 2011

, as compared to


.  Hedge interest increased as a result of $36.7 million of hedges settled on September 30, 2010, with the realized loss being amortized over a ten year period beginning October 2010.


Our equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships increased by

$22.5 million

in


, as compared to


as follows (in thousands):

The increase in our equity in income (loss) in investments in real estate partnerships for the year ended

December 31, 2011

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2010

, is related to our pro-rata share of the decrease in depreciation expense of $5.7 million, the decrease in interest expense of $5.9 million, the decrease in impairment provisions of $18.5 million, and the net gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million, offset by a decrease in net operating income of $7.8 million and a gain on sale of properties of approximately $700,000 at the individual real estate partnerships.

The following represents the remaining components to determine net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders for the year ended

December 31, 2011

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2010

(in thousands):

Income tax expense increased

$4.3 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2010

, primarily due to the increase in deferred income taxes in 2011 and a tax benefit recognized in 2010.

Income from discontinued operations was

$8.0 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

and includes

$5.9 million

in gains, net of taxes, from the sale of seven properties and the operations of the shopping centers sold.  Income from discontinued operations was

$8.9 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

and includes

$7.6 million

in gains, net of taxes, from the sale of three properties and the operations, including impairment, of the shopping centers sold.

Gain on sale of real estate increased approximately

$1.4 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2010

.  During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, we sold eight out-parcels for no gain, and we sold two operating properties that did not meet the definition of discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement, for a gain of $2.4 million.  During the year ended

December 31, 2010

we sold eleven out-parcels for a gain of approximately $661,000, and we sold three operating properties for a gain of approximately $332,000.   These properties did not meet the definition of discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement.


The income attributable to noncontrolling interests remained relatively consistent for the year ended

December 31, 2011

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2010

, increasing approximately $233,000.  Preferred stock dividends also remained consistent between


and


.

Related to our Parent Company's results, our net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended

December 31, 2011

was

$31.7 million

, an increase of

$42.6 million

as compared to net loss of

$10.9 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

.  The higher net income was primarily related to the increase in revenue, offset partially by the increase in operating expenses, from 2010 to 2011 as discussed above, a decrease in impairment provisions of

$7.5 million

, the

$4.2 million

net loss on extinguishment of debt incurred in 2010, and an increase in equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships of

$22.5 million

.  Our diluted net income per share was

$0.35

for the year ended

was

$31.8 million

an increase of

$42.6 million

as compared to net loss of

$10.8 million

for the year ended

Supplemental Earnings Information

We use certain non-GAAP performance measures, in addition to the required GAAP presentations, as we believe these measures are beneficial to us in improving the understanding of the Company's operational results among the investing public. We believe such measures make comparisons of other REITs' operating results to the Company's more meaningful. We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.

The following are our definitions of Same Property Net Operating Income ("NOI"), Funds from Operations ("FFO"), and Core FFO, which we believe to be beneficial non-GAAP performance measures used in understanding our operational results:

Ÿ

Same Property NOI

includes only the net operating income of comparable operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared and this excludes all Properties in Development and Non-Same Properties.  A Non-Same Property is a property acquired during either period being compared or a development completion that is less than 90% funded or features less than two years of anchor operations. In no event can a development completion be termed a non-same property for more than two years.  As such, Same Property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of our properties.

Ÿ

NOI

is calculated as total property revenues (minimum rent, percentage rents, and recoveries from tenants and other income) less direct property operating expenses (operating and maintenance and real estate taxes) from the properties owned by the Company, and excludes corporate-level income (including management, transaction, and other fees), for the entirety of the periods presented.

Ÿ

FFO

is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable property, net of tax, excluding operating real estate impairments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  We compute FFO for all periods presented in accordance with NAREIT's definition.  Many companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions.  Since FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions, and impairments, it can provide a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore, should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity.

Ÿ

Core FFO

is an additional performance measure we use as the computation of FFO includes certain non-cash and non-comparable items that affect our period-over-period performance. Core FFO excludes from FFO, but is not limited to, transaction income or expense, gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt, development and outparcel gains and losses and other non-core items. We provide a reconciliation of FFO to Core FFO as shown below.


The Company's reconciliation of property revenues and property expenses to Same Property NOI for the years ended

December 31, 2012

and


is as follows (in thousands):

(1)

Includes revenues and expenses attributable to non-same property, development, and corporate activities.

(2)

Includes straight-line rental income, net of reserves, above and below market rent amortization, banking charges, and other fees.

(3)

Excludes non-operating related expenses.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks. We believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations. Generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems.  Where available, we have applied and been accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs. We have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination. We have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk. We monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites. We also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.  At

December 31, 2012

we had reserves of

$9.3 million

for our pro-rata share of environmental remediation, primarily from property acquisitions.  We believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations; however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.

Inflation/Deflation

Inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, inflation may become a greater concern in the future. Substantially all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.  Most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.  In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates.  However, during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness, minimum rents and percentage rents may decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines. Occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market Risk

We are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk:

•

We have a

$800.0 million

Line commitment and a $100.0 million Term Loan commitment, as further described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our Line commitment has a variable interest rate that is based upon a

annual rate of LIBOR plus 117.5 basis points

and our Term Loan has a

variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 145 basis points

.  LIBOR rates charged on our Line commitment and our Term Loan (collectively our "unsecured credit facilities") change monthly. The spread on the unsecured credit facilities is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, the spread on the unsecured credit facilities would increase, resulting in higher interest costs.

•

We are also exposed to changes in interest rates when we refinance our existing long-term fixed rate debt. The objective of our interest rate risk management program is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.  Our interest rate swaps are structured solely for the purpose of interest rate protection.

We have

$181.6 million

of fixed rate debt maturing in 2013 and 2014 that has a weighted average fixed interest rate of 5.22%, which includes

$150.0 million

of unsecured long-term debt that matures in

April 2014

.  We also have $350.0 million of unsecured long-term debt that matures in 2015.  In order to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising before we obtain new unsecured borrowings in 2014 and 2015, we entered into five forward-starting interest rate swaps during December 2012, for


the same ten year periods we expect for our future borrowings.  These swaps total $300.0 million of notional value, with weighted average fixed ten year swap rates of 2.09% for those starting in 2014 and 2.48% for those starting in 2015, as discussed in note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   We continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments. Based upon the current capital markets, our current credit ratings, our current capacity under our Line and Term Loan, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings, we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal cash flows (in thousands, excluding interest expense), weighted average interest rates of remaining debt, and the fair value of total debt (in thousands) as of

December 31, 2012

, by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes. Although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table, those rates represent rates that existed at

December 31, 2012

and are subject to change on a monthly basis.

The table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of

December 31, 2012

and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date. Since firm commitments are not presented, the table has limited predictive value. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time, and actual interest rates.

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Regency Centers Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Regency Centers Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)    Organization and Principles of Consolidation

General

Regency Centers Corporation (the “Parent Company”) began its operations as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) in


and is the general partner of Regency Centers, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”). At

December 31, 2012

, the Parent Company owned approximately

99.8%

of the outstanding common Partnership Units of the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, and development of retail shopping centers through the Operating Partnership, and has no other assets or liabilities other than through its investment in the Operating Partnership. At

December 31, 2012

, the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (the "Company” or “Regency”) directly owned


retail shopping centers and held partial interests in an additional


retail shopping centers through investments in real estate partnerships (also referred to as joint ventures or co-investment partnerships).

Estimates, Risks, and Uncertainties

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates in the Company's financial statements relate to the carrying values of its investments in real estate including its shopping centers, properties in development and its investments in real estate partnerships, and accounts receivable, net.  Although the U.S. economy is recovering, economic conditions remain challenging, and therefore, it is possible that the estimates and assumptions that have been utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements could change significantly, if economic conditions were to weaken.

Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and consolidated partnerships in which the Company has a controlling interest.  Investments in real estate partnerships not controlled by the Company are accounted for under the equity method.  All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Ownership of the Parent Company

The Parent Company has a single class of common stock outstanding and two series of preferred stock outstanding (“Series 6 and 7 Preferred Stock”). The dividends on the Series 6 and 7 Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter.

Ownership of the Operating Partnership

The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units.  At

December 31, 2012

, the Parent Company owned approximately

99.8%

or

90,394,486

of the total

90,571,650

Partnership Units outstanding.  Net income and distributions of the Operating Partnership are allocable to the general and limited common Partnership Units in accordance with their ownership percentages.

Investments in Real Estate Partnerships

Investments in real estate partnerships not controlled by the Company are accounted for under the equity method.  The accounting policies of the real estate partnerships are similar to the Company's accounting policies.  Income or loss from these real estate partnerships, which includes all operating results (including impairment losses) and gains on sales of properties within the joint ventures, is allocated to the Company in accordance with the respective partnership agreements.  Such allocations of net income or loss are recorded in equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The net difference in the


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2012

carrying amount of investments in real estate partnerships and the underlying equity in net assets is either accreted to income and recorded in equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations over the expected useful lives of the properties and other intangible assets, which range in lives from


to


years, or recognized at liquidation if the joint venture agreement includes a unilateral right to elect to dissolve the real estate partnership and, upon such an election, receive a distribution in-kind, as discussed further below.

Cash distributions of earnings from operations from investments in real estate partnerships are presented in cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash distributions from the sale of a property or loan proceeds received from the placement of debt on a property included in investments in real estate partnerships are presented in cash flows provided by investing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The Company evaluates the structure and the substance of its investments in the real estate partnerships to determine if they are variable interest entities. The Company has concluded that these partnership investments are not variable interest entities. Further, the joint venture partners in the real estate partnerships have significant ownership rights, including approval over operating budgets and strategic plans, capital spending, sale or financing, and admission of new partners. Upon formation of the joint ventures, the Company, through the Operating Partnership, also became the managing member, responsible for the day-to-day operations of the real estate partnerships. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, the Company evaluated its investment in each real estate partnership and concluded that the other partners have kick-out rights and/or substantive participating rights and, therefore, the Company has concluded that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for these investments and they do not require consolidation. Under the equity method of accounting, investments in real estate partnerships are initially recorded at cost, subsequently increased for additional contributions and allocations of income, and reduced for distributions received and allocations of loss. These investments are included in the consolidated financial statements as investments in real estate partnerships.

Noncontrolling Interests

The Company consolidates all entities in which it has a controlling ownership interest. A controlling ownership interest is typically attributable to the entity with a majority voting interest. Noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity, in a subsidiary or consolidated entity, not attributable, directly or indirectly to the Company. Such noncontrolling interests are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within equity or capital, but separately from stockholders' equity or partners' capital. On the Consolidated Statements of Operations, all of the revenues and expenses from less-than-wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries are reported in net income (loss), including both the amounts attributable to the Company and noncontrolling interests. The amounts of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to the Company and to the noncontrolling interests are clearly identified on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Noncontrolling Interests of the Parent Company

The consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company include the following ownership interests held by owners other than the preferred and common stockholders of the Parent Company: (i) the limited Partnership Units in the Operating Partnership held by third parties (“Exchangeable operating partnership units”) and (ii) the minority-owned interest held by third parties in consolidated partnerships (“Limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships”). The Parent Company has included all of these noncontrolling interests in permanent equity, separate from the Parent Company's stockholders' equity, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The portion of net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) of the Parent Company.

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 480, securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets at the option of the holder, not solely within the control of the issuer, are classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests outside of permanent equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Parent Company has evaluated the conditions as specified under the FASB ASC Topic 480 as it relates to exchangeable operating partnership units outstanding and concluded that it has the right to satisfy the redemption requirements of the units by delivering unregistered common stock. Each


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2012

outstanding exchangeable operating partnership unit is exchangeable for one share of common stock of the Parent Company, and the unit holder cannot require redemption in cash or other assets. Limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships are not redeemable by the holders. The Parent Company also evaluated its fiduciary duties to itself, its shareholders, and, as the managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, to the Operating Partnership, and concluded its fiduciary duties are not in conflict with each other or the underlying agreements. Therefore, the Parent Company classifies such units and interests as permanent equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Noncontrolling Interests of the Operating Partnership

The Operating Partnership has determined that Limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships are noncontrolling interests. The Operating Partnership has included these noncontrolling interests in permanent capital, separate from partners' capital, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Capital and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The portion of net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements Comprehensive Income (Loss) of the Operating Partnership.

(b)    Revenues

The Company leases space to tenants under agreements with varying terms. Leases are accounted for as operating leases with minimum rent recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease regardless of when payments are due. The Company estimates the collectibility of the accounts receivable related to base rents, straight-line rents, expense reimbursements, and other revenue taking into consideration the Company's historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and remaining lease terms

provisions for doubtful accounts included in discontinued operations in


.

The following table represents the components of accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, as of

December 31, 2012

and


in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):

Substantially all of the lease agreements with anchor tenants contain provisions that provide for additional rents based on tenants' sales volume ("percentage rent"). Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements. Substantially all lease agreements contain provisions for reimbursement of the tenants' share of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance (“CAM”) costs. Recovery of real estate taxes, insurance, and CAM costs are recognized as the respective costs are incurred in accordance with the lease agreements.

As part of the leasing process, the Company may provide the lessee with an allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements. These leasehold improvements are capitalized and recorded as tenant improvements, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the remaining lease term. If the allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event the Company is not considered the owner of the improvements, the allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease term as a reduction of minimum rent. Factors considered during this evaluation include, among other things, who holds legal title to the improvements as well as other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement and


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2012

provisions for substantiation of such costs (e.g. unilateral control of the tenant space during the build-out process). Determination of the appropriate accounting for the payment of a tenant allowance is made on a lease-by-lease basis, considering the facts and circumstances of the individual tenant lease. When the Company is the owner of the leasehold improvements, recognition of lease revenue commences when the lessee is given possession of the leased space upon completion of tenant improvements. However, when the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant, the lease inception date is the date the tenant obtains possession of the leased space for purposes of constructing its leasehold improvements.

Profits from sales of real estate are recognized under the full accrual method by the Company when: (i) a sale is consummated; (ii) the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property; (iii) the Company's receivable, if applicable, is not subject to future subordination; (iv) the Company has transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership; and (v) the Company does not have substantial continuing involvement with the property.

The Company sells shopping centers to joint ventures in exchange for cash equal to the fair value of the ownership interest of its partners. The Company accounts for those sales as “partial sales” and recognizes gains on those partial sales in the period the properties were sold to the extent of the percentage interest sold, and in the case of certain real estate partnerships, applies a more restrictive method of recognizing gains, as discussed further below. The gains and operations associated with properties sold to these real estate partnerships are not classified as discontinued operations because the Company continues to partially own and manage these shopping centers.

As of

December 31, 2012

,

six

of the Company's joint ventures (“DIK-JV”) give each partner the unilateral right to elect to dissolve the real estate partnership and, upon such an election, receive a distribution in-kind (“DIK”) of the assets of the real estate partnership equal to their respective capital account, which could include properties the Company previously sold to the real estate partnership. The liquidation provisions require that all of the properties owned by the real estate partnership be appraised to determine their respective fair values. As a general rule, if the Company initiates the liquidation process, its partner has the right to choose the first property that it will receive with the Company choosing the next property that it will receive in liquidation. If the Company's partner initiates the liquidation process, the order of the selection process is reversed. The process then continues with an alternating selection of properties by each partner until the balance of each partner's capital account, on a fair value basis, has been distributed. After the final selection, to the extent that the fair value of properties in the DIK-JV are not distributable in a manner that equals the balance of each partner's capital account, a cash payment would be made to the other partner by the partner receiving a property distribution in excess of its capital account. The partners may also elect to liquidate some or all of the properties through sales rather than through the DIK process.

Because the contingency associated with the possibility of receiving a particular property back upon liquidation is not satisfied at the property level, but at the aggregate level, no deferred gain is recognized on property sold by the DIK-JV to a third party or received by the Company upon actual dissolution. Instead, the property received upon dissolution is recorded at the carrying value of the Company's investment in the DIK-JV on the date of dissolution.

The Company is engaged under agreements with its joint venture partners to provide asset management, property management, leasing, investing, and financing services for such joint ventures' shopping centers. The fees are market-based, generally calculated as a percentage of either revenues earned or the estimated values of the properties managed or the proceeds received, and are recognized as services are rendered, when fees due are determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. The Company also receives transaction fees, as contractually agreed upon with a joint venture, which include fees such as acquisition fees, disposition fees, “promotes”, or “earnouts”.

(c)    Real Estate Investments

Land, buildings, and improvements are recorded at cost. All specifically identifiable costs related to development activities are capitalized into properties in development on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Properties in development are defined as properties that are in the construction or initial lease-up phase and have not reached their initial full occupancy.  Once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy, costs are no longer capitalized.  The capitalized costs include pre-development costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, and allocated direct employee costs incurred during the period of development. Interest costs are capitalized into each development


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2012

project based upon applying the Company's weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended. The Company discontinues interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would the Company capitalize interest on the project beyond


months after substantial completion of the building shell.

The following table represents the components of properties in development as of

December 31, 2012

and


in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):

Construction in process represents developments where the Company has not yet incurred at least

90%

of the expected costs to complete and the anchor tenant has not yet been open for at least

two

calendar years. Construction complete and in lease-up represents developments where the Company has incurred at least

90%

of the estimated costs to complete and the anchor tenant has not yet been open for at least

two

calendar years, but is still completing lease-up and final tenant build out. Land held for future development represents projects not in construction, but identified and available for future development if and when the market demand for a new shopping center exists.

The Company incurs costs prior to land acquisition including contract deposits, as well as legal, engineering, and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center. These pre-development costs are included in properties in development in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. At

December 31, 2012

and


, the Company had capitalized pre-development costs of

$3.5 million

and

$2.1 million

, respectively, of which

$2.3 million

and

$1.0 million

, respectively, were refundable deposits. If the Company determines that the development of a particular shopping center is no longer probable, any related pre-development costs previously capitalized are immediately expensed in other expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


, and


, the Company expensed pre-development costs of approximately

$1.5 million

,

$241,000

, and

$520,000

, respectively, in other expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the respective assets are recorded in operating and maintenance expense.

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of approximately


years for buildings and improvements, the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term subject to a maximum of


years for tenant improvements, and

three

to

seven

years for furniture and equipment.

The Company and the real estate partnerships account for business combinations using the acquisition method by recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. The Company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred.

The Company's methodology includes estimating an “as-if vacant” fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements. In addition, the Company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets, considering the following

three

categories: (i) value of in-place leases, (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases, and (iii) customer relationship value.

The value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period. The value of in-place leases is recorded to amortization expense over the remaining initial term of the respective leases.

Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2012

estimate of fair market lease rates for comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The value of above-market leases is amortized as a reduction of minimum rent over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of below-market leases is accreted to minimum rent over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including below-market renewal options, if applicable. The Company does not assign value to customer relationship intangibles if it has pre-existing business relationships with the major retailers at the acquired property since they do not provide incremental value over the Company's existing relationships.

The Company classifies an operating property or a property in development as held-for-sale upon satisfaction of the following criteria: (i) management commits to a plan to sell a property (or group of properties), (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such properties, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the property have been initiated, (iv) the sale of the property is probable and transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year, (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and (vi) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.

Given the nature of all real estate sales contracts, it is not unusual for such contracts to allow prospective buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract. In addition, certain other matters critical to the final sale, such as financing arrangements, often remain pending even upon contract acceptance. As a result, properties under contract may not close within the expected time period, or may not close at all. Therefore, any properties categorized as held-for-sale represent only those properties that management has determined are probable to close within the requirements set forth above. Operating properties held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. The recording of depreciation and amortization expense is suspended during the held-for-sale period. If circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and, as a result, the Company decides not to sell a property previously classified as held-for-sale, the property is reclassified as held and used and is measured individually at the lower of its (i) carrying amount before the property was classified as held-for-sale, adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used or (ii) the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell. Any required adjustment to the carrying amount of the property reclassified as held and used is included in income from continuing operations in the period of the subsequent decision not to sell and the results of operations previously reported in discontinued operations are reclassified and included in income from continuing operations for all periods presented.

When the Company sells a property or classifies a property as held-for-sale and will not have significant continuing involvement in the operation of the property, the operations of the property are eliminated from ongoing operations and classified in discontinued operations. Its operations, including any mortgage interest and gain on sale, are reported in discontinued operations so that the operations are clearly distinguished. Prior periods are also reclassified to reflect the operations of the property as discontinued operations. When the Company sells an operating property to a joint venture or to a third party, and will continue to manage the property, the operations and gain on sale are included in income from continuing operations.

We evaluate whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  Through the evaluation, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results.  Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.  To the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.  If such indicators are not identified, management will not assess the recoverability of a property's carrying value.  If  a property previously classified as held and used is changed to held-for-sale, the Company estimates fair value, less expected costs to sell, which could cause the Company to determine that the property is impaired.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2012

The fair value of real estate assets is highly subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach.  Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore is subject to a significant degree of management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value.    In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, the Company generally uses market data and comparable sales information.

.

A loss in value of investments in real estate partnerships under the equity method of accounting, other than a temporary decline, must be recognized in the period in which the loss occurs.  If management identifies indicators that the value of the Company's investment in real estate partnerships may be impaired, it evaluates the investment by calculating the fair value of the investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected term of the investment.  As a result of this evaluation, the Company established

no

provision for impairment during the year ended

, and established a provision for impairment of

$4.6 million

on one investment in real estate partnership during the year ended

, respectively, of cash was restricted through escrow agreements and certain mortgage loans.

(e)    Notes Receivable

The Company records notes receivable at cost on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and interest income is accrued as earned and netted against interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. If a note receivable is past due, meaning the debtor is past due per contractual obligations, the Company ceases to accrue interest. However, in the event the debtor subsequently becomes current, the Company will resume accruing interest and record the interest income accordingly. The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal for all notes receivable to determine whether impairment exists using the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the note receivable's effective interest rate or, alternatively, at the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. In the event the Company determines a note receivable or a portion thereof is considered uncollectible, the Company records a provision for impairment. The Company estimates the collectibility of notes receivable taking into consideration the Company's experience in the retail sector, available internal and external credit information, payment history, market and industry trends, and debtor credit-worthiness.

(f)    Deferred Costs

Deferred costs include leasing costs and loan costs, net of accumulated amortization. Such costs are amortized over the periods through lease expiration or loan maturity, respectively. If the lease is terminated early, or if the loan is repaid prior to maturity, the remaining leasing costs or loan costs are written off. Deferred leasing costs consist of internal and external commissions associated with leasing the Company's shopping centers. Net deferred leasing costs were

, respectively.

(g)    Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates. The Company's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company's borrowings.

All derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.

The Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or forecasted transaction, and the Company designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) while the ineffective portion of the derivative's change in fair value is recognized in the Statements of Operations as a gain or loss on derivative instruments. Upon the settlement of a hedge, gains and losses remaining in OCI are amortized over the underlying term of the hedged transaction.

The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows and/or forecasted cash flows of the hedged items.

In assessing the valuation of the hedges, the Company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and termination costs at each balance sheet date. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.

The settlement of interest rate swap terminations is presented in cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

(h)    Income Taxes

The Parent Company believes it qualifies, and intends to continue to qualify, as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).  As a REIT, the Parent Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders are at least equal to REIT taxable income.  Regency Realty Group, Inc. (“RRG”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is a Taxable REIT Subsidiary (“TRS”) as defined in Section 856(l) of the Code.  RRG is subject to federal and state income taxes and files separate tax returns.  As a pass through entity, the Operating Partnership's taxable income or loss is reported by its partners, of which the Parent Company, as general partner and approximately

99.8%

owner, is allocated its pro-rata share of tax attributes.

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to stockholders, differs from net income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily because of differences in depreciable lives and cost bases of the shopping centers, as well as other timing differences.

Tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.  Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.  The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years (


and forward for federal and state) based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.

(i)    Earnings per Share and Unit

Basic earnings per share of common stock and unit are computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares and units, respectively, outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share and unit reflect the conversion of obligations and the assumed exercises of securities including the effects of shares issuable under the Company's share-based payment arrangements, if dilutive. Dividends paid on the Company's share-based compensation awards are not participating securities as they are forfeitable.

(j)    Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants stock-based compensation to its employees and directors. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the award and the cost of the stock-based compensation is expensed over the vesting period.

When the Parent Company issues common shares as compensation, it receives a like number of common units from the Operating Partnership. The Company is committed to contributing to the Operating Partnership all proceeds from the exercise of stock options or other share-based awards granted under the Parent Company's Long-Term Omnibus Plan (the “Plan”). Accordingly, the Parent Company's ownership in the Operating Partnership will increase based on the amount of proceeds contributed to the Operating Partnership for the common units it receives. As a result of the issuance of common units to the Parent Company for stock-based compensation, the Operating Partnership accounts for stock-based compensation in the same manner as the Parent Company.

(k)    Segment Reporting

The Company's business is investing in retail shopping centers through direct ownership or through joint ventures. The Company actively manages its portfolio of retail shopping centers and may from time to time make decisions to sell lower performing properties or developments not meeting its long-term investment objectives. The proceeds from sales are reinvested into higher quality retail shopping centers, through acquisitions or new developments, which management believes will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns. It is management's intent that


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2012

all retail shopping centers will be owned or developed for investment purposes; however, the Company may decide to sell all or a portion of a development upon completion. The Company's revenues and net income are generated from the operation of its investment portfolio. The Company also earns fees for services provided to manage and lease retail shopping centers owned through joint ventures.

The Company's portfolio is located throughout the United States; however, management does not distinguish or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of allocating resources or capital. The Company reviews operating and financial data for each property on an individual basis; therefore, the Company defines an operating segment as its individual properties. The individual properties have been aggregated into one reportable segment based upon their similarities with regard to both the nature and economics of the centers, tenants and operational processes, as well as long-term average financial performance. In addition, no single tenant accounts for

5%

or more of revenue and none of the shopping centers are located outside the United States.

(l)    Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.

•

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

•

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the Company's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.

The Company also remeasures nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new basis event, at fair value in subsequent periods.

(m)    Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted

On January 1, 2012, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-04, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs" ("ASU 2011-04").  ASU 2011-04 provides new guidance concerning fair value measurements and disclosure.  The new guidance is the result of joint efforts by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") to develop a single, converged fair value framework on how to measure fair value and the necessary disclosures concerning fair value measurements.  The guidance is applied prospectively.  The adoption by the Company resulted in expanded disclosures over fair value measurements, included in note 6.

On January 1, 2012, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income" ("ASU 2011-05").  ASU 2011-05 revised guidance over the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in the financial statements.  This guidance removes the previous presentation options and provides that entities must report comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements.  This guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income.  The adoption by the Company resulted in a new Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss), presented immediately following the Statements of Operations.


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2012

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, "Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" ("ASU 2013-02").  ASU 2013-02 does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements.  This ASU requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in its entirety to net income.  For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts.  This guidance is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012 and early adoption is permitted.  The Company has adopted this guidance as of December 31, 2012.  The adoption by the Company did not have any impact on our financial results, rather resulted in adding parenthetical cross-references in our Consolidated Statements of Operations to related footnote disclosures.

Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted

In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, "Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities" ("ASU 2011-11").  ASU 2011-11 requires disclosures to allow investors to better compare financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP with financial statements prepared under IFRS.  The FASB expects to issue an ASU to clarify that the scope of the new disclosures is intended to be limited to derivative instruments, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending arrangements.  This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Retrospective application is required.  The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements, rather will result in additional disclosures.

(n)    Reclassifications and other

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following table represents the Company's net deferred tax assets as of

December 31, 2012

and


recorded in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):

During


and

$15.6 million

and

$1.4 million

, respectfully.  The Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards totaling

$2.9 million

, which expire between


and


.

The evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance requires the Company to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The Company's framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets includes weighing recent taxable income (loss), projected future taxable income (loss) of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax assets, the carryforward periods for the net operating loss, including the effect of reversing taxable temporary differences, and prudent feasible tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of deferred tax assets.  At

December 31, 2012

, the cumulative history of taxable losses and projected future taxable income within the TRS caused the Company to determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized.  As a result, a valuation allowance has been established for the entire amount of the deferred tax asset.

The Company accounts for uncertainties in income tax law in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, under which tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter. Federal and state tax returns are open from


and forward for the Company.

to a total of

$800.0 million

. The maturity date was extended by one year, and the Line will expire in

September 2016, subject to a one-year extension

at the Company's option. The amended Line bears interest at an

annual rate of LIBOR plus 117.5 basis points

As of

December 31, 2012

, management of the Company believes it is in compliance with all financial covenants for the Line.

On

November 17, 2011

These derivative financial instruments are comprised of interest rate swaps, which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.  The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings as a gain or loss on derivative instruments.

The fair value of the Company's notes receivable is estimated by calculating the present value of future contractual cash flows discounted at an interest rate available for notes of the same terms and maturities adjusted for customer specific credit risk.  The interest rates range from

7.0%

to

8.1%

and

7.1%

to

8.1%

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively, based on the Company's estimates.  The fair value of notes receivable was determined primarily using Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Based on the estimates made by the Company, the fair value of notes receivable was

$23.7 million

and

$35.3 million

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

Notes Payable

The fair value of the Company's notes payable is estimated by discounting future cash flows of each instrument at rates that reflect the current market rates available to the Company for debt of the same terms and maturities.  These rates range from

2.4%

to

3.3%

and

2.4%

to

4.3%

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively, based on the Company's estimates.  Fixed rate loans assumed in connection with real estate acquisitions are recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at fair value at the time the property is acquired including those loans assumed in distribution-in-kind liquidations. The fair value of the notes payable was determined using Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Based on the estimates used by the Company, the fair value of notes payable was

$2.0 billion

and

$2.1 billion

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

Unsecured Credit Facilities

The fair value of the Company's unsecured credit facilities is estimated based on the interest rates currently offered to the Company by the Company's third partylenders, which is estimated to be

1.6%

and

1.5%

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.  The fair value of the unsecured credit facilities was determined using Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy. Based on the estimates used by the Company, the fair value of the unsecured credit facilities was

$170.2 million

and

$40.0 million

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

(b)  Fair Value Measurements

Internally developed fair value measurements, including the unobservable inputs, are evaluated for reasonableness based on current transactions and experience in the real estate and capital markets. Service providers involved in fair value measurements are evaluated for competency and qualifications on an ongoing basis. The Company's valuation policies and procedures are determined by its Finance Group, which reports to the Chief Financial Officer, and the results of significant fair value measurements are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.  The following describe valuation methods for each of our financial instruments required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Trading Securities Held in Trust

The Company has investments in marketable securities that are classified as trading securities held in trust on the  accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value of the trading securities held in trust was determined using quoted prices in active markets, considered Level 1 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.   Changes in the value of trading securities are recorded within net investment (income) loss from deferred compensation plan in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.  Changes in these credit valuation adjustments are not expected to result in a significant change in the valuation of the Company's derivatives.

The following are fair value measurements recorded on a nonrecurring basis at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively (in thousands):

Long-lived assets held and used are comprised primarily of real estate. The Company recognized a

$54.5 million

impairment loss related to two operating properties during the year ended

December 31, 2012

.  The Company has determined that it is more likely than not that one of the properties will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life, and the other property was exhibiting weak operating fundamentals including low economic occupancy for an extended period of time, which led to the impairments.  As a result, the Company estimated the fair value of the properties and recorded the impairment losses.  As discussed in Note 1, the Company considers a property to be held-for-sale when the property is under contract, significant non-refundable deposits have been made by the potential buyer, the assets are immediately available for transfer, and there are no contingencies related to the sale that may prevent the transaction from closing.  Given the nature of all real estate sales contracts, these conditions or criteria are typically not satisfied until the actual closing of the transaction.  However, each potential transaction is evaluated based on its separate facts and circumstances.  The Company evaluated these properties and determined that they did not meet the criteria for held-for-sale as of

December 31, 2012

.

In addition, the Company recognized a

$16.4 million

impairment loss related to one operating property and the Company's investment in a real estate partnership during the year ended

December 31, 2011

.  This operating property exhibited weak operating fundamentals, including low economic occupancy for an extended period of time, which lead to the impairment.  As a result, the Company estimated the fair value of the properties and recorded an impairment loss.


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2012

Fair value for those assets measured using Level 3 inputs was determined through the use of an income approach. The income approach estimates an income stream for a property (typically 10 years) and discounts this income plus a reversion (presumed sale) into a present value at a risk adjusted rate.  Overall cap rates and growth assumptions utilized in this approach are derived from market transactions as well as other financial and industry data.  The terminal cap rate and discount rate are significant inputs to this valuation.  The following are ranges of key inputs used in determining the fair value of real estate measured using Level 3 inputs as of

December 31, 2012

and


:

Changes in these inputs could result in a significant change in the valuation of the real estate and a change in the impairment loss recognized during the period.

The recorded amounts of stock-based compensation expense represent amortization of the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards over the respective vesting periods. Compensation expense specifically identifiable to development and leasing activities is capitalized and included above.

The Company established the Plan under which the Board of Directors may grant stock options and other stock-based awards to officers, directors, and other key employees. The Plan allows the Company to issue up to approximately

4.1 million

shares in the form of the Parent Company's common stock or stock options.  At

December 31, 2012

, there were approximately

3.1 million

shares available for grant under the Plan either through options or restricted stock.

Stock options are granted under the Plan with an exercise price equal to the Parent Company's stock's price at the date of grant. All stock options granted have

ten

-year lives, contain vesting terms of

one

to

five

years from the date of grant and some have dividend equivalent rights.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton closed-form (“Black-Scholes”) option valuation model. The Company believes that the use of the Black-Scholes model meets the fair value measurement objectives of FASB ASC Topic 718 and reflects all substantive characteristics of the instruments being valued.

was approximately

, and

$1,000

, respectively. The Company issues new shares to fulfill option exercises from its authorized shares available.

The Company grants restricted stock under the Plan to its employees as a form of long-term compensation and retention. The terms of each grant vary depending upon the participant's responsibilities and position within the Company. The Company's stock grants can be categorized as either time-based awards, performance-based awards, or market-based awards. All awards were valued at the fair market value, earn dividends throughout the vesting period, and have no voting rights.  Fair value is measured using the grant date market price for all time-based or performance-based awards.  Market based awards are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value based on the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the projected stock price at the time of payout, discounted to the valuation date over the three year performance period.   Assumptions include historic volatility over the previous three year period, risk-free interest rates, and Regency's historic daily return as compared to the market index.  Because the award payout includes dividend equivalents and the total shareholder return includes the value of dividends, no dividend yield assumption is required for the valuation.  Compensation expense is measured at the grant date and recognized over the vesting period.

•

Time-based awards vest 25% per year beginning on the first anniversary following the grant date. These grants are subject only to continued employment and not dependent on future performance measures; and accordingly, if such vesting criteria are not met, compensation cost previously recognized would be reversed. During


, the Company granted

112,496

shares of time-based awards.


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2012

•

Performance-based awards are earned subject to future performance measurements, including individual goals, annual growth in earnings, and compounded

three

-year growth in earnings. Once the performance criteria are achieved and the actual number of shares earned is determined, shares will vest over a required service period. If such performance criteria are not met, compensation cost previously recognized would be reversed. The Company considers the likelihood of meeting the performance criteria based upon management's estimates from which it determines the amounts recognized as expense on a periodic basis. During


, the Company granted

25,435

shares of performance-based awards.

•

Market-based awards are earned dependent upon the Company's total shareholder return in relation to the shareholder return of peer indices over a

three

-year period (“TSR Grant”). Once the market criteria are met and the actual number of shares earned is determined, 100% of the earned shares vest. The probability of meeting the market criteria is considered when calculating the estimated fair market value on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation. These awards were accounted for as awards with market criteria, with compensation cost recognized over the service period, regardless of whether the market criteria are achieved and the awards are ultimately earned and vest.

401 (k) Retirement Plan

The Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees, which permits participants to defer up to the maximum allowable amount determined by the IRS of their eligible compensation. This deferred compensation, together with Company matching contributions equal to 100% of employee deferrals up to a maximum of

$5,000

of their eligible compensation, is fully vested and funded as of

December 31, 2012

$1.1 million

for the years ended

, and


, respectively.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan

The Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (“NQDCP”) which allows select employees and directors to defer part or all of their salary, cash bonus, and restricted stock awards.  Restricted stock awards that are designated to be deferred into the NQDCP upon vesting are classified as liabilities from the grant date through the vesting date.  All contributions into the participants' accounts are fully vested upon contribution to the NQDCP and are deposited in a Rabbi trust.

The Company accounts for the NQDCP in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 710 and the restricted stock awards under Topic 718. The assets in the Rabbi trust remain subject to the claims of creditors of the Company and are not the property of the participant. The NQDCP allows participants to allocate their account balance among various investments, including several mutual funds and the Company's common stock.  Effective June 20, 2011, the Company amended its NQDCP such that participant account balances held in the Regency common stock fund, including future deferrals of Regency common stock, must remain allocated to the Regency common stock fund and may only be distributed to the participant in the form of Regency common stock upon termination from the plan.  Additionally, participant account balances allocated to various diversified mutual funds are prohibited from being allocated into the Regency common stock fund.  The assets of the Rabbi trust, exclusive of the shares of the Company's common stock, are classified as trading securities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and accordingly, realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized within income from deferred compensation plan in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Investments in shares of the Company's common stock are included, at cost, as treasury stock in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Parent Company and as a reduction of general partner capital in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Operating Partnership.  The participants' deferred compensation liability, exclusive of the shares of the Company's common stock after the June 20, 2011 amendment, is included within accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and was

$22.8 million

and

$21.1 million

at

and


, respectively.  Increases or decreases in the deferred compensation liability, exclusive of amounts attributable to participant investments in the shares of the Company's common stock, are recorded as general and administrative expense within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Changes in participant account balances related to the Regency common stock fund are recorded directly within stockholders' equity.

Legal fees are expensed as incurred.

The Company is also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to real estate pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks.  The Company believes that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on its financial position, liquidity, or operations; however, it can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to the shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to it; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Parent Company's management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the Parent Company conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, the Parent Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Parent Company in the reports it files or submits is accumulated and communicated to management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Parent Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the Parent Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

, the Parent Company's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2012

.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued a report, included herein, on the effectiveness of the Parent Company's internal control over financial reporting.

The Parent Company's system of internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Controls and Procedures (Regency Centers, L.P.)

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Operating Partnership's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of its general partner, the Operating Partnership conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of its general partner concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Operating Partnership in the reports it files or submits is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of its general partner, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Operating Partnership's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of its general partner, the Operating Partnership conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

, the Operating Partnership's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2012

.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued a report, included herein, on the effectiveness of the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.

The Operating Partnership's system of internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance and may not


prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Controls

There have been no changes in the Operating Partnership's internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with this evaluation that occurred during the fourth quarter of


and that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.
