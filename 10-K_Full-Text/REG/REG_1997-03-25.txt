                                       PART I
Item 1.     Business

      General:  The  principal  business  of  Regency  Realty  Corporation  (the
"Company") is owning,  operating and developing  grocery  anchored  neighborhood
shopping  centers in targeted  infill markets in the Southeast.  The Company,  a
Florida  corporation  organized in 1993,  commenced  operations as a real estate
investment  trust in 1993 with the  completion  of its Initial  Public  Offering
("IPO"), and was the successor to the real estate business of The Regency Group,
Inc. which had operated since 1963. Unless the context requires  otherwise,  all
references to the "Company" include (1) its wholly owned real estate properties,
an operating  partnership  and two joint  ventures and (2) Regency Realty Group,
Inc. (the "Management Company").

      The Company owns and operates 50 commercial real estate properties,  40 of
which are  anchored by grocery  stores.  At December 31,  1996,  the  properties
contained 5.5 million square feet ("GLA") and were 95.4% leased.  The properties
are all located in the Southeast,  primarily in Florida (71% of GLA) and Georgia
(11% of GLA). At December 31, 1996,  approximately  10.2%, 4.6%, 3.3%, and 3% of
annualized total rent pertains to leases with Publix, Winn-Dixie,  Wal-Mart, and
Kroger,  respectively.   For  more  specific  data  and  information  about  the
properties  owned by the Company see Item 2. Properties,  included  elsewhere in
this Form 10-K.  In  addition,  through  the  Management  Company,  the  Company
performs property  management,  leasing and client services on a selective basis
that generate fees and have the potential for creating synergistic relationships
that  lead  to  additional  acquisition,  development,  management  and  leasing
opportunities.

      Operating  and  Investment  Philosophy:  The  Company's  key operating and
investment  objectives  are (1) to  generate  superior  shareholder  returns  by
sustaining above average annual increases in funds from operations and long term
growth in free and clear  cash  flow,  (2) to create  the  largest  real  estate
portfolio of quality grocery anchored  neighborhood shopping centers in targeted
infill markets in the  Southeast,  (3) to build the strongest  possible  capital
structure through  conservative  financial management that will cost effectively
provide the capital to fund the  Company's  growth  strategy,  and (4) to put in
place the people and processes  necessary to enable the Company to implement its
Retail Operating System, a system which  incorporates  research based investment
strategies and value added leasing and management systems.

      Management  believes  that  the key to  successful  implementation  of its
strategies is to continue to exploit the Company's  competitive  strengths which
include,   its  cohesive  and   experienced   management   team,   its  research
capabilities,  its strong capital structure,  its access to competitively priced
capital, its client relationships, its market expertise in targeted markets, its
growing  critical  mass of  quality  neighborhood  shopping  centers  focused on
convenience  and daily  necessities,  and the vibrant  targeted  submarkets that
enjoy a favorable environment for retail sales.

      Since its IPO in 1993, the Company has acquired 27 properties at a cost of
$224.7 million.  These acquisitions were financed with $114.4 of new equity, and
$110.3  million  of new debt.  The  Company's  total  market  capitalization  at
December 31, 1996 was $529.1 million vs. $172.9 million at the completion of its
IPO, an increase of 206%.  At December 31,  1996,  the  Company's  debt to total
market capitalization was 32.4%. The Company intends to continue its emphasis on
acquiring and developing grocery anchored neighborhood shopping centers that are
the most significant  shopping  centers serving a targeted  submarket that offer
daily necessities and convenience.


      Current  Developments:  During  1996,  the  Company  acquired  13  grocery
anchored  shopping centers for  approximately  $107.1 million,  representing 1.4
million square feet (the "1996 Acquisitions"). Total real estate investments, at
cost, increased 40.1% from December 31, 1995. The 1996 Acquisitions were located
in Florida,  Georgia, and North Carolina and included six Publix locations,  two
Winn-Dixie  locations,  and two Kroger  locations.  The Company also  acquired a
parcel of land for a new Winn-Dixie  development and an existing shopping center
for redevelopment.

      On June 11, 1996, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the
"Agreement")  with Security  Capital U.S. Realty and Security  Capital  Holdings
S.A. (collectively,  "US Realty"). As part of the Agreement,  the Company agreed
to sell 7,499,400 shares of common stock to U.S. Realty for $132,176,925. During
1996, the Company sold  3,651,800  shares to US Realty for  $64,362,975  and the
proceeds  were used to reduce the  outstanding  balance of its  acquisition  and
development   line  of  credit  with  Wells  Fargo  Realty   Advisors   Funding,
Incorporated  (the "Wells Fargo Line").  Not later than June,  1997, the Company
intends to sell the  remaining  shares  committed to US Realty,  the proceeds of
which  will be used to  further  reduce the  balance  of its Wells  Fargo  Line,
increasing the capacity for future acquisitions.

      During 1996, the Company entered into discussions with Branch  Properties,
L.P.  ("Branch"),  an Atlanta  based real estate  partnership  that operates and
develops  shopping  centers in the  Southeast,  for purposes of  evaluating  the
potential  acquisition  of the assets of Branch.  On March 7, 1997,  the Company
acquired the assets of Branch for approximately  $190 million.  At closing,  the
Company issued 3,529,598 redeemable  partnership units ("Redeemable Units") from
Regency  Retail  Partnership  L.P.  ("Partnership")  in exchange for 100% of the
existing partnership units of Branch, and assumed  approximately $112 million of
debt, net of minority  interests.  During the next three years, Branch will have
the right to earn an additional $23.3 million of Redeemable Units based upon the
achievement  of increased  income levels.  At closing the Company  acquired from
Branch 18 shopping  centers  comprising  1.9  million  square  feet;  8 shopping
centers  containing  700,000 square feet that are currently under development or
redevelopment,  and management  contracts on over 4 million square feet owned by
third parties.  Including the completion of the  development  and  redevelopment
properties,  the three largest  anchor  tenants in these  properties are Publix,
Kroger, and Harris Teeter. Also at closing, the Company reduced Branch's debt by
approximately $25.7 million from a $26 million sale of common stock to US Realty
which funded concurrent with the acquisition.

      In  December,1996  the Company  negotiated  an increase in the  commitment
amount of the Wells Fargo Line to $90 million.  The Company  increased the Wells
Fargo Line  commitment  amount to $150 million during the first quarter of 1997.
The unused  balance of the Wells  Fargo Line will be used to continue to acquire
and  develop  neighborhood  shopping  centers in the  Southeast.  In addition to
acquiring  single  neighborhood  shopping centers from individual  sellers,  the
Company  also  expects to  continue  to engage in  discussions  with  public and
private  real estate  entities  regarding  possible  portfolio  acquisitions  or
business combinations.

      Matters  Relating to the Real Estate  Business:  The Company is subject to
certain  business  risks  arising in  connection  with owning real estate  which
include, among others, (1) the bankruptcy or insolvency of, or a downturn in the
business of, any of its anchor tenants,  (2) the  possibility  that such tenants
will not renew their leases as they expire,  (3) vacated anchor space  affecting
the entire  shopping  center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant's
customer  drawing power, (4) risks relating to leverage,  including  uncertainty
that the Company will be able to  refinance  its  indebtedness,  and the risk of
higher  interest  rates,  (5)  the  Company's  inability  to  satisfy  its  cash
requirements for operations and the possibility that the Company may be required
to borrow  funds to meet  distribution  requirements  in order to  maintain  its
qualification  as  a  REIT,  (6)  potential  liability  for  unknown  or  future
environmental   matters  and  costs  of  compliance   with  the  Americans  with
Disabilities  Act, and (7) the risk of uninsured  losses.  Unfavorable  economic
conditions  could also  result in the  inability  of  tenants in certain  retail
sectors to meet their lease obligations and otherwise could adversely affect the
Company's ability to attract and retain desirable tenants.  The Company believes
that the shopping  centers are relatively well  positioned to withstand  adverse
economic  conditions  since they typically are anchored by grocery stores,  drug
stores and discount  department stores that offer day-to-day  necessities rather
than luxury goods.


      Compliance with Governmental  Regulations:  The Company like others in the
commercial real estate industry,  is subject to numerous  environmental laws and
regulations  particularly  as they  pertain  to dry  cleaning  plants.  Although
potential liability could exist for unknown or future environmental matters, the
Company  believes that dry cleaning  tenants are  operating in  accordance  with
current laws and  regulations  and has  established  procedures to monitor these
operations. For additional information, see Management's Discussion and Analysis
included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

      Competition:  There are numerous shopping center  developers,  real estate
companies  and other  owners of real estate that operate in the  Southeast  that
compete with the Company in seeking retail  tenants to occupy vacant space,  for
the  acquisition of shopping  centers,  and for the  development of new shopping
centers.

      Changes in  Policies:  The  Company's  Board of Directors  determines  the
Company's  policies  with  respect to  certain  activities,  including  its debt
capitalization, growth, distributions, REIT status, and investment and operating
policies.  The Board of  Directors  has no present  intention to amend or revise
these policies.  However, the Board of Directors may do so at any time without a
vote of the Company's stockholders.

      Employees:  The Company  presently has four management and leasing offices
in Florida and one office in Atlanta, Georgia. As of March 20, 1997, the Company
had  approximately  160 employees and believes that relations with its employees
are good.




Item 2. Properties

      The Company  owns and  operates  46  neighborhood  shopping  centers and 4
suburban  office  complexes  in  the  Southeast.   The  properties   consist  of
approximately  5.5 million  square feet of Company  owned  gross  leasable  area
(GLA). At December 31, 1996, the locations of properties by GLA were as follows:

                  Company   Percent     Anchor               Percent    Number

      The Company's  neighborhood  shopping  centers  generally have one or more
anchor  tenants,  the majority of which are anchored by Publix (17),  Winn-Dixie
(9),  Wal-Mart  (7) or Kroger (3),  with 37 of the  center's  having two or more
anchor  tenants.  The average size of the  properties  is 118,146 sf. Six of the
shopping  centers are anchored by four grocery  stores and two Wal-Mart  stores,
where the store operator owns its own building.  To the extent that the shopping
centers are  anchored by store space which the Company does not own, the Company
can capitalize on the customer  drawing power and other  advantages  provided by
these  anchor  tenants  while  not  bearing  the  leasing  and  operating  risks
associated with leasing space to such a tenant. In most instances,  these stores
reimburse the Company for their share of common area maintenance expenses.

           The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 1996,  information
as to retail tenants which individually account for 1.0% or more of total rent:

     1)  Total  rent  includes  annualized  base  rent,   percentage  rent,  and
reimbursements for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and insurance.
     2)    Based on annualized total rent on all properties owned at
 December 31,1996.





      The Company's leases have lease terms generally ranging from three to five
years for tenant  space under 5,000  square  feet.  Leases  greater  than 10,000
square feet generally have lease terms in excess of ten years,  mostly comprised
of anchor  tenants.  Many of the anchor leases contain  provisions  allowing the
tenant  the  option  of  extending  the  term of the  lease at  expiration.  The
Company's  leases  provide for the monthly  payment in advance of fixed  minimum
rentals,  additional rents calculated as a percentage of the tenant's sales, the
tenant's  pro rata  share of real  estate  taxes,  insurance,  and  common  area
maintenance  expenses,  and  reimbursement  for  utility  costs if not  directly
metered.  At December 31, 1996,  42% of the Company's  leases have terms of five
years or less,  which allows the Company the  opportunity to increase rents upon
lease  expiration.  Approximately  42% of the Company's leases expire beyond ten
years.

     The following table sets forth a schedule of lease expirations for the next
ten years, assuming that no tenants exercise renewal options:

Item 5.   Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Shareholder
          Matters

    Prior to the  Company's  IPO there was no public  market  for the  Company's
common stock. In connection with its IPO, 5,620,779 shares were sold for cash at
the  initial  offering  price of $19.25 per share.  The common  stock  commenced
trading  on the New York  Stock  Exchange  ("NYSE")  under the  symbol  "REG" on
October 29, 1993. There have been no additional public stock offerings since the
IPO; however,  there have been several private equity  transactions  since 1994.
The high and low sales  prices  for the  common  stock on the NYSE  during  each
quarter for the period January 1, 1995 to December 31, 1996 were as follows:

      The approximate  number of holders of record of the common stock was 3,000
as of March 20, 1997.

       On  March  7,  1997,  the  Company  acquired  Branch   Properties,   L.P.
("Branch"),  an Atlanta based real estate partnership that owns,  operates,  and
develops shopping centers in the Southeast,  for approximately $190 million.  At
closing, the Company issued 3,373,801 redeemable  partnership units ("Redeemable
Units") from Regency Retail Partnership, L.P. ("Partnership") and 155,797 shares
of  common  stock in  exchange  for 100% of the  existing  partnership  units of
Branch,  and assumed  approximately  $112 million of debt excluding the minority
interest amount. During the next three years, Branch will have the right to earn
an additional  $23.3 million of Redeemable  Units based upon the  achievement of
increased  income  levels.  Subject to  shareholder  approval  to be held at the
Company's  1997 Annual  Meeting,  the  Redeemable  Units will be redeemable  for
Regency common stock.


      On June 11, 1996, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the
"Agreement") with US Realty. Under the Agreement, the Company has agreed to sell
7,499,400  shares of common  stock to US Realty at a price of $17.625  per share
representing  total maximum proceeds of  $132,176,925.  During 1996, the Company
sold 3,651,800 shares to US Realty for $64,362,975 and the proceeds were used to
pay down the Wells Fargo Line. The Company sold 1,475,178 shares to US Realty on
March 3, 1997 and the proceeds of $26 million were primarily used to reduce debt
assumed  as part of the Branch  transaction.  Not later  than  June,  1997,  the
Company  intends  to sell the  remaining  shares  committed  to US  Realty,  the
proceeds of which will be used to further reduce its  outstanding  debt. As part
of the  Agreement,  US Realty also has  participation  rights  entitling them to
purchase  additional  equity in the Company at the same price as that offered to
other  purchasers in order to preserve  their pro rata  ownership in the Company
including  common  stock  and  Redeemable  Units  issued  as part of the  Branch
transaction.
                                  
      In connection with the  acquisition of five shopping  centers during 1995,
the Company completed a $50 million private placement (the "Private  Placement")
with LaSalle Advisors Limited  Partnership (the "Investor") on December 20, 1995
by issuing 2,500,000 shares of non-voting Class B common stock at $20 per share.
The Company  initially  issued  $18,250,000  of Series B preferred  stock to the
Investor on October 26, 1995 to fund an October  purchase of one of the shopping
centers;  however, these shares were subsequently converted into Class B common.
The Class B common shares are convertible  into 2,975,468 shares of common stock
beginning on the third  anniversary  of the issuance date subject to limitations
that the  holder  may not  beneficially  own  more  than  4.9% of the  Company's
outstanding common stock except in certain circumstances.

     In connection  with the purchase of a shopping center on June 29, 1994, the
Company  issued  7,665  shares  of  Series  A  nonvoting  preferred  stock  at a
liquidation  value of $1,000 per share. In 1996, the holder converted all of the
remaining  preferred  stock  outstanding  into 94,282 shares of common stock. In
1995 and 1994, the preferred stock was converted into 222,465 and 111,411 shares
of common stock, respectively.

      Future  dividends  paid by the Company on common and Class B common  stock
will be at the  discretion  of the Board of  Directors  of the  Company and will
depend on the actual cash flow of the Company, its financial condition,  capital
requirements,  the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of
the Code,  limitations  imposed  by the  financial  covenants  of the  Company's
outstanding  debt,  and  such  other  factors  as the  Board of  Directors  deem
relevant.

Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

The following  discussion  should be read in conjunction  with the  accompanying
Consolidated   Financial   Statements   and  Notes  thereto  of  Regency  Realty
Corporation (the "Company") appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Business

       The  Company's  principal  business is operating and  developing  grocery
anchored  neighborhood  shopping  centers  in  targeted  infill  markets  in the
Southeast. At December 31, 1996 the Company owned 50 properties or approximately
5.5 million  square  feet(GLA);  71% of the GLA of the properties are located in
Florida,  and 40 are grocery  anchored.  The Company's  four largest  tenants in
order by  number  of  leased  store  locations  are  Publix  Supermarkets  (17),
Winn-Dixie Stores (9), Wal-Mart (5), and The Kroger Co. (3).

Acquisition and Development

       During  1996,  the  Company  acquired  13  shopping  centers  (the  "1996
Acquisitions") for $107 million (including certain budgeted capital improvements
designed to improve the  performance  of the acquired  property)  for a total of
1,417,259  square  feet.  The  Company  also  acquired a parcel of land to begin
development of a Winn-Dixie shopping center, and entered into a joint venture to
redevelop an existing  shopping  center.  Total  estimated cost at completion of
these  development  projects  is  $15.2  million  and both  are  expected  to be
completed during the first quarter of 1998.

       During 1995, the Company acquired five shopping centers and completed the
development  or  expansion  of four  shopping  centers  for a total  cost of $62
million (the "1995 Acquisitions").

       On  March  7,  1997,  the  Company  acquired  Branch   Properties,   L.P.
("Branch"),  an Atlanta based real estate partnership that owns,  operates,  and
develops shopping centers in the Southeast,  for approximately $190 million.  At
closing, the Company issued 3,373,801 redeemable  partnership units ("Redeemable
Units") from Regency Retail Partnership, L.P. ("Partnership") and 155,797 shares
of  common  stock in  exchange  for 100% of the  existing  partnership  units of
Branch,  and assumed  approximately  $112 million of debt excluding the minority
interest amount. During the next three years, Branch will have the right to earn
an additional  $23.3 million of Redeemable  Units based upon the  achievement of
increased income levels. At closing the Company acquired from Branch 18 shopping
centers  comprising  1.9 million  square  feet;  8 shopping  centers  containing
700,000 square feet that are currently under development or  redevelopment,  and
management  contracts  on over 4 million  square  feet  owned by third  parties.
Including the completion of the development and  redevelopment  properties,  the
three largest tenants in these properties are Publix, Kroger, and Harris Teeter.
After the closing,  the  Company's  five  largest  tenants in order by number of
leased store locations are Publix (24), Winn-Dixie (9), Kroger (5) Wal-Mart (5),
and Harris Teeter (3). Also at closing,  the Company reduced the assumed debt by
approximately  $25.7  million  funded from a $26 million sale of common stock to
Security Capital U.S. Realty ("US Realty") further discussed below.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

      The Company's  total  indebtedness  at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $172
million and $116 million, respectively, of which $94 million and $91 million had
fixed interest rates averaging 7.6% and 7.5%, respectively. The weighted average
interest  rate on total debt at  December  31,  1996 and 1995 was 7.5% and 7.7%,
respectively.  Based upon the Company's total market  capitalization (total debt
and the market value of equity) at December  31, 1996 of $529  million  (closing
common stock price of $26.25 per share and total  common  stock and  equivalents
outstanding of  13,619,221),  the Company's debt to total market  capitalization
ratio was 32.4% vs. 40.6% at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

      During 1996,  the Company  negotiated an unsecured  $90 million  revolving
line of credit with Wells Fargo Realty Advisors  Funding,  Incorporated  ("Wells
Fargo Line") with an interest  rate equal to the London  Interbank  Offered Rate
("LIBOR")  plus  1.625%.  The  proceeds  were used to pay off the balance of the
secured line of credit and fund the 1996 Acquisitions.  The balance of the Wells
Fargo  Line  at  December  31,  1996,  was $74  million.  The  unused  available
commitment  on the Wells Fargo Line will be used to finance  future  acquisition
and development activity.  The Company increased the Wells Fargo Line commitment
amount to $150  million  during  the first  quarter  of 1997,  and  reduced  the
variable interest rate to LIBOR plus 1.50%.
                              
      On June 11, 1996, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the
"Agreement") with US Realty. Under the Agreement, the Company has agreed to sell
7,499,400  shares of common  stock to US Realty at a price of $17.625  per share
representing  total maximum proceeds of  $132,176,925.  During 1996, the Company
sold 3,651,800 shares to US Realty for $64,362,975 and the proceeds were used to
pay down the Wells Fargo Line. The Company sold 1,475,178 shares to US Realty on
March 3, 1997 and the proceeds of $26 million were primarily used to reduce debt
assumed  as part of the Branch  transaction.  Not later  than  June,  1997,  the
Company  intends  to sell the  remaining  shares  committed  to US  Realty,  the
proceeds of which will be used to further reduce its  outstanding  debt. As part
of the  Agreement,  US Realty also has  participation  rights  entitling them to
purchase  additional  equity in the Company at the same price as that offered to
other  purchasers in order to preserve  their pro rata  ownership in the Company
including  common  stock  and  Redeemable  Units  issued  as part of the  Branch
transaction.

      The Company funded the 1995  Acquisitions  from borrowings on the Line and
the proceeds from a $50 million private placement (the "Private Placement"). The
Private Placement was completed on December 20, 1995 by issuing 2,500,000 shares
of  non-voting  Class B common  stock to a single  investor.  The Class B common
shares are  convertible  into 2,975,468  shares of common stock beginning on the
third  anniversary of the issuance date subject to  limitations  that the holder
may not  beneficially  own more than 4.9% of the  Company's  outstanding  common
stock except in certain circumstances.

      The   Company's   principal   demands  for   liquidity  are  dividends  to
stockholders,  the operation,  maintenance and  improvement of real estate,  and
scheduled interest and principal payments. The Company paid common and preferred
dividends of $16.2 million and $10.8 million to its stockholders during 1996 and
1995,  respectively.  The percentage of funds from operations paid out in common
dividends,  or "dividend payout ratio", was 80.7% and 85.2% at December 31, 1996
and 1995,  respectively.  In January 1997,  the Company  increased its quarterly
common dividend to $.42 per share or $1.68 annually. Total dividends expected to
be paid by the Company during 1997 will increase  substantially over 1996 due to
the common stock dividend increase,  and the Agreement with US Realty;  however,
the Company expects the dividend payout ratio to remain below 85%.


      During 1996 and 1995, the Company's net cash used in investing  activities
was $109.8 million and $61.5 million,  respectively,  related  primarily to real
estate  acquisitions,   construction  and  building  improvements.  The  Company
invested  approximately  $2.9 million and $2.0 million for  improvements  to its
properties at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  The Company anticipates
that cash provided by operating activities, unused amounts under the Wells Fargo
Line, and cash reserves are adequate to meet liquidity requirements. At December
31,  1996,  the Company had cash  balances of $8.3 million of which $1.8 million
was restricted.

      The Company has made an election to be taxed,  and is  operating  so as to
qualify,  as a Real Estate  Investment  Trust  ("REIT")  for Federal  income tax
purposes,  and  accordingly  has paid no Federal  income tax  subsequent  to its
Initial Public  Offering in 1993.  While the Company  intends to continue to pay
dividends  to its  stockholders,  the Company  will reserve such amounts of cash
flow as it considers necessary for the proper maintenance and improvement of its
real estate, while still maintaining its qualification as a REIT.

      The Company's real estate  portfolio has grown  substantially  during 1996
and 1995 as a result of the acquisitions  and  developments  discussed above. In
addition to the Branch  acquisition,  during 1997, the Company expects to exceed
the 1996 level of growth and intends to meet the related  capital  requirements,
principally  for  the  acquisition  or  development  of  new  properties,   from
borrowings on the Wells Fargo Line, and from  additional  public equity and debt
offerings. Because such acquisition and development activities are discretionary
in nature,  they are not  expected  to burden the  Company's  capital  resources
currently available for liquidity requirements.

Results of Operations

      Comparison of 1996 to 1995

      Revenues  increased  $13.0  million or 38% to $46.9 million in 1996 due to
the 1996  Acquisitions  providing $3.7 million in revenues in 1996 (partial year
ownership),  and the 1995  Acquisitions  providing $9.5 million in 1996 vs. $2.3
million in 1995 (partial year ownership).  At December 31, 1996, the real estate
portfolio  contained  approximately  5.5  million  sf, was 95.4%  leased and had
average rents of $8.73 per sf.  Minimum rent  increased $9.7 million or 39%, and
recoveries from tenants  increased $1.9 million or 32%. On a same property basis
(excluding the 1996 and 1995  Acquisitions)  revenues  increased $2.0 million or
6.3%,  primarily  due to higher  occupancy  levels,  and an  increase in average
rents. At December 31, 1996, the real estate  portfolio on a same property basis
was 96.2% leased vs. 95.7% leased at December 31, 1995.  Same  property  average
rents grew to $8.13 at  December  31,  1996 from  $8.08 at  December  31,  1995.
Revenues from property management,  leasing, brokerage, and development services
provided  on  properties  not owned by the  Company  were $3.4  million  in 1996
compared to $2.4 million in 1995,  the increase due primarily to higher build to
suit development activity.

      Operating expenses increased $6.9 million or 34% to $26.9 million in 1996.
Combined operating and maintenance  expense and real estate taxes increased $3.4
million  or 39%  during  1996 to  $12.1  million  due to the  1996  Acquisitions
generating  $1.0 million in operating  expenses in 1996 (partial year ownership)
and the 1995 Acquisitions  producing $2.6 million in operating  expenses in 1996
vs. $.5 million in 1995 (partial  year  ownership).  General and  administrative
expense  increased  24% during 1996 to $6.0 million due to hiring new  employees
during 1996 as part of the development of a "retail  operating system" that will
ensure  that the  Company  has the  resources  necessary  to acquire  and manage
properties in the future. Depreciation and amortization was 36% higher than 1995
due to the 1996 and 1995 Acquisitions.

      Net interest expense  increased to $10.1 million in 1996 from $8.4 million
in 1995 or 21% due primarily to increased  average  outstanding  loan  balances.
Outstanding debt at December 31, 1996 was $172 million vs. $116 million in 1995.
Weighted  average  interest rates were 7.5% in 1996 vs. 7.7% in 1995.  Preferred
stock  dividends  declined as a result of the full  conversion  of the remaining
Series A preferred  stock into common stock  during 1996.  Net income for common
stockholders was $9.9 million or $.96 per share in 1996 vs. $5.0 million or $.75
per share in 1995.


      Comparison of 1995 to 1994

      Revenues increased $6.0 million or 21% to $34.0 million in 1995 due to the
1995  Acquisitions  providing  $2.3  million in revenues in 1995  (partial  year
ownership),  and the 1994  Acquisitions  providing $7.6 million in 1995 vs. $5.0
million in 1994 (partial year ownership).  At December 31, 1995, the real estate
portfolio contained approximately 4 million sf, was 96.2% leased and had average
rents  of  $8.54  per sf.  Minimum  rent  increased  $4.3  million  or 21%,  and
recoveries from tenants  increased $1.4 million or 33%. On a same property basis
(excluding the 1995 and 1994  Acquisitions)  revenues  increased $1.1 million or
4.8%,  primarily  due to higher  occupancy  levels,  and an  increase in average
rents. At December 31, 1995, the real estate  portfolio on a same property basis
was 95.3% leased vs. 93.7% leased at December 31, 1994.  Same  property  average
rents grew to $8.49 at  December  31,  1995 from  $8.34 at  December  31,  1994.
Revenues from property management,  leasing, brokerage, and development services
provided  on  properties  not owned by the  Company  were $2.4  million  in 1995
compared to $2.3 million in 1994.

      Operating expenses increased $3.1 million or 18% to $20.0 million in 1995.
Combined operating and maintenance  expense and real estate taxes increased $1.5
million  or 22%  during  1995  to  $8.7  million  due to the  1995  Acquisitions
generating  $.45 million in operating  expenses in 1995 (partial year ownership)
and the 1994 Acquisitions  producing $1.7 million in operating  expenses in 1995
vs. $1.0 million in 1994 (partial year  ownership).  General and  administrative
expense  increased  8% during  1995 to $4.9  million due to  increased  staffing
requirements  related to the  acquisitions,  and nominal  increases  in employee
compensation.  Depreciation and amortization was 22% higher than 1994 due to the
1995 and 1994 Acquisitions.

      Net interest  expense  increased to $8.4 million in 1995 from $5.7 million
in 1994 or 47% due primarily to increased average  outstanding loan balances and
higher interest rates. Outstanding debt at December 31,1995 was $116 million vs.
$108 million in 1994. Weighted average interest rates were 7.7% in 1995 vs. 7.2%
in 1994.  Preferred stock dividends  increased from $.28 million in 1994 to $.59
million in 1995 as a result of the Series B  preferred  stock  issued on October
26, 1995 and  outstanding  through  December 20, 1995,  partially  offset by the
conversion of Series A preferred stock into common stock.

      Net income for common  stockholders  was $5.0 million or $.75 per share in
1995 vs. $5.1 million or $.80 per share in 1994.  The reduction is primarily due
to the  increase in net  interest  expense and  depreciation  expense  discussed
above, and additionally,  as it pertains to per share amounts, the dilution from
the  conversion  of the Series A and B  preferred  stock into common and Class B
common stock, respectively.

Funds from Operations

      The Company  considers funds from operations  ("FFO") to be one measure of
REIT  performance  and defines it as net income  (computed  in  accordance  with
generally accepted accounting  principles) excluding gains (or losses) from debt
restructuring  and sales of  property,  adjusted  for certain  noncash  amounts,
primarily  depreciation and amortization,  and after adjustments for investments
in  real  estate  partnerships.  Adjustments  for  investments  in  real  estate
partnerships  are  calculated  to reflect FFO on the same basis.  FFO as defined
above has become a measure used by many industry analysts;  however,  FFO should
not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's
performance  or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity  determined in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.

      FFO for the years ended  December 31, 1996,  1995 and 1994 are summarized
in the following table:
                                               1996        1995         1994
Net income for common stockholders        $   9,907       4,994        5,101
Add:  non-cash amounts:
  Real   estate   depreciation   and

  Common stock compensation:
    Board of directors' fees and
      401 (k) contributions                     613         451          417
    Long-term compensation plans              2,173         815          621
  Straight-lining of rents charge                28         208          206

      In May 1995 the  National  Association  of Real Estate  Investment  Trusts
(NAREIT) amended the definition of FFO and recommended the following  changes to
become effective for fiscal years ending in 1996: (1) amortization of loan costs
and  depreciation of office  furniture and equipment should not be added back to
net income,  (2)  non-recurring  gains (losses) should be excluded from FFO, and
(3) gains (losses) from the sale of undepreciated  real estate  considered to be
part of a company's  recurring  business  may be  included  in FFO.  The Company
modified its definition of FFO for these changes  effective  January 1, 1996 and
has also restated amounts reported for 1995 and 1994 for comparison purposes.

Environmental Matters

      The Company like others in the commercial real estate industry, is subject
to numerous environmental laws and regulations and the operation of dry cleaning
plants at the Company's shopping centers is the principal environmental concern.
The Company  believes  that the dry cleaners are  operating in  accordance  with
current laws and  regulations  and has  established  procedures to monitor their
operations.   Based  on   information   presently   available,   no   additional
environmental  accruals  were made and  management  believes  that the  ultimate
disposition  of currently  known matters will not have a material  effect on the
financial  position,  liquidity,  or  operations  of the Company.  Environmental
matters  are  discussed  further  in note  10,  Contingencies,  of the  notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Economic Conditions

      A substantial number of the Company's  long-term leases contain provisions
designed to mitigate  the  adverse  impact of  inflation  on the  Company's  net
income.  Such provisions include percentage  rentals,  rental escalation clauses
and  reimbursements  for common  area  maintenance,  insurance,  and real estate
taxes.  In  addition,  42% of the  Company's  leases have terms of five years or
less,  which  allows the Company the  opportunity  to increase  rents upon lease
expiration. Approximately 42% of the Company's leases expire beyond 10 years and
are generally anchor tenants.  Unfavorable  economic  conditions could result in
the inability of certain  tenants to meet their lease  obligations and otherwise
could  adversely  affect the Company's  ability to attract and retain  desirable
tenants.  During  1996,  Discovery  Zone ("DZ") filed for  protection  under the
bankruptcy  laws.  DZ had two leases with the  Company,  both of which have been
terminated  and no longer pay rent.  DZ's  annualized  minimum rent  represented
approximately  .50%  of 1996  minimum  rent  reported  by the  Company.  Luria's
currently  has three  leases  with the  Company,  one store of which was  closed
during 1995, but continued to pay rent.  During 1996,  Luria's  defaulted on the
lease of the closed  store and informed the Company that it intends to close its
remaining  two stores during 1997.  Minimum rent from the three  Luria's  leases
represents  approximately  1.2% of  1996  total  minimum  rent  reported  by the
Company.  The three leases with  Luria's  expire  beyond  2007,  and the Company
considers Luria's to be bound by the lease terms.
                                   
     At December  31, 1996  approximately  11%,  5%, 3% and 3% of the  Company's
annualized  rent is  received  from  Publix,  Winn-Dixie,  Wal-Mart  and Kroger,
respectively  (the "Four  Major  Tenants").  During  1996 no tenant had rents in
excess of 10% of the Company's minimum rent. In February,  1996, Wal-Mart closed
its store  located at The  Marketplace  in Alexander  City,  Alabama in order to
relocate to a new larger store  nearby.  Wal-Mart  will continue to pay rent due
under  its  lease  at The  Marketplace  which  expires  in  October,  2007.  The
Marketplace is anchored by a Winn-Dixie  which opened during 1995.  Although the
Company  considers the financial  condition and its  relationship  with the Four
Major  Tenants to be very  solid,  a  significant  downturn  in  business or the
non-renewal of expiring leases of the Four Major Tenants could adversely  affect
the Company.  Management also believes that the shopping  centers are relatively
well  positioned  to  withstand  adverse  economic  conditions  since  they  are
typically anchored by supermarkets,  drug stores and discount  department stores
that offer day-to-day necessities rather than luxury goods.

                         Independent Auditors' Report


The Shareholders and Board of Directors
Regency Realty Corporation:


We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Regency Realty
Corporation  as of  December  31, 1996 and 1995,  and the  related  consolidated
statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three year period  ended  December  31,  1996.  These  consolidated
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of Regency  Realty
Corporation  as of  December  31,  1996  and  1995,  and the  results  of  their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year  period
ended  December  31,  1996 in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

                          REGENCY REALTY CORPORATION

                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                          December 31, 1996 and 1995



1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     (a) General

         Regency Realty  Corporation (the Company) was formed for the purpose of
         managing,  leasing,  brokering,   acquiring,  and  developing  shopping
         centers. The Company also provides management,  leasing,  brokerage and
         development  services  for real estate not owned by the Company  (third
         parties).   The  Company  commenced   operations   effective  with  the
         completion of its initial public offering on November 5, 1993.

         The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
         of Regency Realty Group,  Inc. (the "Management  Company"),  its wholly
         owned  real  estate  properties,  an  operating  partnership,  and  the
         Company's two joint ventures. All significant intercompany balances and
         transactions have been eliminated.

     (b) Revenues

         The Company  leases  space to tenants  under  agreements  with  varying
         terms.  Leases are accounted for as operating  leases with minimum rent
         recognized  on a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  lease
         regardless  of when  payments  are due.  Accrued  rents are included in
         tenant  receivables.  Minimum  rent has been  adjusted  to reflect  the
         effects of recognizing rent on a straight line basis. Substantially all
         of the lease agreements  contain  provisions  which provide  additional
         rents based on tenants' sales volume or  reimbursement  of the tenants'
         share of real estate taxes and certain  common area  maintenance  (CAM)
         costs. These additional rents are reflected on the accrual basis.

         Management,  leasing,  brokerage and development fees are recognized as
         revenue when earned.

     (c) Real Estate Rental Property

         Land,  buildings and  improvements are recorded at cost. All direct and
         indirect costs clearly associated with the acquisition, development and
         construction   of  real  estate  projects  owned  by  the  Company  are
         capitalized  as  buildings  and  improvements,  while  maintenance  and
         repairs  which  do not  improve  or  extend  the  useful  lives  of the
         respective  assets are reflected in operating and maintenance  expense.
         The property  cost  includes  the  capitalization  of interest  expense
         incurred  during  construction  in accordance  with generally  accepted
         accounting  principles.  Included  in  land  is 30  and  8.4  acres  of
         undeveloped  land with a cost  basis of  approximately  $2,600,000  and
         $1,700,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

         Depreciation  is computed using the straight line method over estimated
         useful lives up to forty years for buildings and improvements,  term of
         lease for tenant  improvements,  and five to seven years for  furniture
         and equipment.

     (d) Income Taxes

         The Company has made an election to be taxed, and is operating so as to
         qualify,  as a Real Estate  Investment  Trust (REIT) for Federal income
         tax purposes.  Accordingly, the Company will not pay Federal income tax
         provided distributions to stockholders equal at least the amount of its
         REIT taxable income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code.

     (d) Income Taxes, continued

         Regency  Realty Group,  Inc. files a separate tax return and is subject
         to Federal and State income taxes. This Management  Company had taxable
         income of $150,674 for the year ended  December 31, 1996 and incurred a
         taxable  loss for the years  ended  December  31,  1995 and  1994.  The
         Management Company had a net operating loss carryforward of $484,000 at
         December  31,  1995,  and  accordingly  paid no income tax in 1996.  No
         income  tax  benefit  has  been  recorded  for the net  operating  loss
         carryforwards.

         The tax  basis of real  estate  assets  exceeds  the net book  basis by
         approximately  $1.9 and $7.0  million at  December  31,  1996 and 1995,
         respectively,  primarily  due to higher  depreciation  expense for book
         purposes  and  differences  in  accounting  for real estate held in the
         operating partnership.

     (e) Deferred Costs

         Deferred costs consist of internal and external commissions  associated
         with leasing the rental  property and loan costs  incurred in obtaining
         financing  which are limited to initial direct and  incremental  costs.
         The net leasing  commission  balance  was  $1,108,374  and  $808,291 at
         December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The net loan cost balance was
         $2,853,065 and $2,789,720 at December 31, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.
         Such costs are deferred and amortized  using the  straight-line  method
         over the terms of the  respective  leases  and loans.  Fully  amortized
         deferred  leasing  costs of $958,398  were removed  from the  financial
         statements during 1996.

     (f) Fair Value of Financial Instruments

         The fair value of the Company's  mortgage loans payable and acquisition
         and development line of credit are estimated based on the current rates
         available  to the  Company for debt of the same  remaining  maturities.
         Therefore,   the  Company  considers  their  carrying  value  to  be  a
         reasonable estimation of their fair value.

     (g) Per Share Data

         Net income per common  share  outstanding  is  computed  based upon the
         weighted average shares  outstanding  during the period.  The Company's
         Class B common  stock as well as the  redeemable  units of the  limited
         partner are convertible into shares of common stock and are included in
         the weighted  average shares  calculation as common stock  equivalents.
         The  dilutive  impact  of  common  stock  options  is  included  in the
         calculation of net income per share when the exercise price falls below
         the market price.  Net income per share on a fully diluted basis is not
         different from net income per common share  outstanding and thus is not
         disclosed separately.

     (h) Cash and Cash Equivalents

         Any instruments  which have an original maturity of ninety days or less
         when purchased are considered cash equivalents.

     (i) Estimates

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally
         accepted  accounting  principles  requires the Company's  management to
         make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of
         assets  and  liabilities,  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and
         liabilities,  at the date of the financial  statements and the reported
         amounts of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual
         results could differ from those estimates.

     (j) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

         The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the
         Impairment  of  Long-Lived  Assets  and  for  Long-Lived  Assets  to be
         Disposed  Of",  on  January  1,  1996.  This  Statement  requires  that
         long-lived assets and certain identifiable  intangibles be reviewed for
         impairment  whenever events or changes in  circumstances  indicate that
         the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability
         of  assets  to be held  and used is  measured  by a  comparison  of the
         carrying  amount of an asset to future  net cash flows  expected  to be
         generated by the asset.  If such assets are  considered to be impaired,
         the  impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the
         carrying  amount of the assets  exceed  the fair  value of the  assets.
         Adoption  of this  Statement  did not  have a  material  impact  on the
         Company's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

     (k) Stock Option Plan

         Prior to January 1, 1996,  the Company  accounted  for its stock option
         plan in accordance with the provisions of Accounting  Principles  Board
         ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", and
         related  interpretations.   As  such,  compensation  expense  would  be
         recorded on the date of grant only if the current  market  price of the
         underlying  stock exceeded the exercise  price. On January 1, 1996, the
         Company   adopted   SFAS   No.   123,   "Accounting   for   Stock-Based
         Compensation",  which permits entities to recognize as expense over the
         vesting period the fair value of all stock-based  awards on the date of
         grant. Alternatively,  SFAS No. 123 also allows entities to continue to
         apply the  provisions  of APB  Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net
         income and pro forma earnings per share  disclosures for employee stock
         option grants made in 1995 and future years as if the  fair-value-based
         method  defined  in SFAS No.  123 had been  applied.  The  Company  has
         elected to continue to apply the  provisions  of APB Opinion No. 25 and
         provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.


     (l) Reclassifications

         Certain  reclassifications  have been made to the 1994 and 1995 amounts
         to conform to classifications adopted in 1996.


2.   Acquisitions of Real Estate Rental Property

     During  1996 and 1995,  the  Company  acquired  18  shopping  centers  (the
     "Acquisitions")  accounted  for as purchases  with  consideration  totaling
     approximately $160.4 million in cash and the assumption of a mortgage loan.
     The operating results are included in the Company's  consolidated financial
     statements  from  the  date  each  property  was  acquired.  The  following
     unaudited  pro forma  information  presents  the  consolidated  results  of
     operations as if the  Acquisitions  had occurred on January 1, 1995,  after
     giving  effect  to  certain  adjustments  including  depreciation  expense,
     additional general and administration  costs,  interest expense on new debt
     incurred, and an increase in the weighted average common shares outstanding
     for Common and Class B common stock issued to acquire  shopping  centers as
     if it had been  issued on January 1, 1995.  Pro forma  revenues  would have
     been $57.6  million and $53.5 million in 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  Pro
     forma net income for common  stockholders would have been $10.6 million and
     $8.0  million  in 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  Pro forma net  income  per
     common  share would have been $.98 per share and $.76 per share in 1996 and
     1995,  respectively.  This data does not purport to be  indicative  of what
     would have occurred had the  acquisitions  been made on January 1, 1995, or
     of results which may occur in the future.

3.   Investments In Real Estate Partnerships

     The Company has a 10%  investment in Village  Commons  Shopping  Center and
     during 1996 acquired a 25%  investment  in Ocean East Mall by  contributing
     $881,307 in cash.  These  investments  are recorded on the equity method of
     accounting  with  income  being  recognized  in the  year  reported  by the
     partnership.  The Company's  combined  investment in these two partnerships
     was  $1,035,107  and $315,389 at December 31, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.
     Net  income  is  allocated  in  accordance  with  each  of the  partnership
     agreements.  The Company's combined  proportionate  share of net income was
     $69,990, $4,226 and $16,943 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and
     1994, respectively.

     At  December  31,  1996  and  1995,   the  combined  total  assets  of  the
     partnerships  were  $13,147,083  and  $8,345,732,  respectively,  and total
     liabilities  were  $7,109,378 and  $5,192,241,  respectively.  Combined net
     income was $323,174,  $42,260 and $169,432 for the years ended December 31,
     1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

4.   Mortgage Loans Payable

4.   Mortgage Loans Payable (continued)

     Principal maturities on the mortgage loans are as follows:

                  Year                         Amount

                  1997                       6,774,592

                                            ----------
                                          $ 97,906,288
                                          ============    
     As part of  their  borrowing  arrangements,  the  Company  is  expected  to
     maintain  escrow  balances  for the  payment  of real  estate  taxes on the
     mortgaged  properties,  and in the case of the  $51,000,000  mortgage loan,
     also  maintain  interest,   insurance  and  specified  capital  improvement
     escrows.  Escrow  balances  recorded  as cash  and  cash  equivalents  were
     $1,069,337 and $1,255,421 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

5.   Acquisition and Development Line of Credit

     The Company negotiated a $90 million unsecured  acquisition and development
     revolving line of credit,  the Wells Fargo Line, during 1996 which replaced
     the existing secured line of credit, the Line. The Wells Fargo Line will be
     used to finance  future  real estate  acquisitions  and  developments.  The
     interest rate is based on the LIBOR  plus1.625%  with interest only for two
     years,  and if then  terminated,  becomes a two year term loan  maturing in
     May,  2000  with  principal  due in  seven  equal  quarterly  installments.
     However, the borrower may request a one year extension of the interest only
     revolving period annually in May of each year beginning in 1997.

6.   Stockholders' Equity

     On June 11, 1996, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase  Agreement (the
     "Agreement")  with  Security  Capital  U.S.  Realty  and  Security  Capital
     Holdings  S.A. (  collectively,  "US  Realty").  Under the  Agreement,  the
     Company has agreed to sell 7,499,400 shares of Common Stock to US Realty at
     $17.625 per share  representing  total  maximum  proceeds of  $132,176,925.
     During  1996,  the  Company  sold   3,651,800   shares  to  US  Realty  for
     $64,362,975.  Not  later  than  June 1, 1997  ("Subsequent  Closing"),  the
     Company  may sell up to  3,847,600  shares for a total of  $67,813,950.  US
     Realty will have the right,  exercisable  on a one-time basis in June 1997,
     to acquire  additional shares of common stock to the extent that the shares
     to be acquired at the Subsequent Closing have not yet been purchased.

     In connection  with the purchase of a shopping center on February 28, 1996,
     the Company issued 28,848 Partnership  Operating Units to a limited partner
     convertible  on a one for one basis into  shares of common  stock after the
     first anniversary of the issuance date.

     The Company completed a $50,000,000  private placement by issuing 2,500,000
     shares of non-voting  Class B common stock to a single investor on December
     20, 1995 (the "Private Placement"). The proceeds from the Private Placement
     were used to acquire five shopping  centers.  The Company  initially issued
     $18,250,000  of Series B  preferred  stock on October  26, 1995 to fund the
     acquisition of a shopping center. These shares were subsequently  converted
     into Class B common  stock.  The Class B common stock is  convertible  into
     2,975,468 shares of common stock beginning on the third  anniversary of the
     issuance date, subject to certain limitations defined in the agreement. The
     dividend on each share of Class B common is payable when and if declared by
     the Board of Directors  pari passu with any dividend on the common stock of
     the Company.

     In connection  with the purchase of a shopping center on June 29, 1994, the
     Company  issued  7,665  shares of Series A nonvoting  preferred  stock at a
     liquidation value of $1,000 per share. In 1996, the holder converted all of
     the  remaining  preferred  stock  outstanding  into 94,282 shares of common
     stock. In 1995 and 1994, the preferred stock was converted into 222,465 and
     111,411 shares of common stock, respectively.

7.   Long-term Stock Incentive Plans

     In 1993, the Company adopted a Long Term Omnibus Plan (the "Plan") pursuant
     to which  the Board of  Directors  may grant  stock  and stock  options  to
     officers,  directors  and other key  employees.  The Plan  provides for the
     issuance of up to 12% of the  Company's  common shares  outstanding  not to
     exceed 3 million  shares of authorized  but unissued  common  stock.  Stock
     options are granted with an exercise price equal to the stock's fair market
     value at the date of grant.  All stock options granted have ten year terms,
     and with  respect  to  officers  and  other  key  employees,  become  fully
     exercisable  after five years from the date of grant,  and with  respect to
     directors, become fully exercisable after one year.

     At December 31, 1996, there were approximately 1.1 million shares available
     for grant  under the Plan.  The per share  weighted-average  fair  value of
     stock options  granted during 1996 and 1995 was $3.04 and $1.08 on the date
     of grant using the Black  Scholes  option-pricing  model with the following
     weighted-average   assumptions:   1996  -  expected  dividend  yield  6.6%,
     risk-free interest rate of 5.9%,  expected  volatility 21%, and an expected
     life of five years; 1995 - expected dividend yield 9.2%, risk-free interest
     rate of 5.4%, expected volatility 19%, and an expected life of five years.

     The Company  applies APB  Opinion  No. 25 in  accounting  for its Plan and,
     accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock options
     in the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Had  the  Company  determined
     compensation  cost  based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock
     options   under  SFAS  No.  123,  the   Company's  net  income  for  common
     stockholders  would have been  reduced to the pro forma  amounts  indicated
     below:

                             on December 31, 1995 and accordingly had no
                             effect to income.

     Pro forma net income for common stockholders  reflects only options granted
     in 1996 and 1995.  Therefore,  the full impact of calculating  compensation
     cost for stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma
     net  income  for  common  stockholders   amounts  presented  above  because
     compensation  cost is  reflected  over  the  options'  vesting  period  and
     compensation  cost for  options  granted  prior to  January  1, 1995 is not
     considered.

     Stock option activity during the periods indicated is as follows:

7.   Long-term Stock Incentive Plans (continued)

     At December 31,  1996,  the range of exercise  prices and  weighted-average
     remaining  contractual life of the outstanding  options was $16.75 - $26.25
     and 7.5 years, respectively.

     At  December  31,  1996 and 1995,  the  number of options  exercisable  was
     186,000 and 31,500,  respectively,  and the weighted-average exercise price
     of those options was $19.09 and $19.16, respectively.

     Also as part of the Plan,  in 1993 and  1996,  certain  officers  purchased
     common stock at fair market value  directly from the Company,  of which 90%
     and 95%,  respectively,  was financed by a stock  purchase loan provided by
     the Plan. These recourse loans are fully secured by stock, bear interest at
     fixed  rates of 7.34% to 7.79% and  mature  after ten  years.  The Board of
     Directors  may  authorize  the  forgiveness  of  all  or a  portion  of the
     principal balance based on the Company's achievement of specified financial
     objectives,  and total stockholder return performance targets. During 1996,
     1995 and 1994,  $646,598 $379,418 and $252,944 was forgiven,  respectively,
     and is included  as a charge to income on the  consolidated  statements  of
     operations.  The Company also has a performance based restricted stock plan
     for officers whereby a portion of the shares  authorized under the Plan may
     be  granted  upon the  achievement  of  certain  total  stockholder  return
     performance  targets.  Shares granted under the plan become fully vested by
     December 31, 2000. During 1996, the initial measurement and grant date, the
     Company  charged  $809,400  to  income  on the  consolidated  statement  of
     operations.

8.   Operating Leases

     The Company's  properties are leased to tenants under operating leases with
     expiration  dates  extending  to the year 2041.  Future  minimum rent under
     noncancelable  operating  leases as of December  31,1996,  excluding tenant
     reimbursements of operating  expenses and excluding  additional  contingent
     rentals based on tenants' sales volume are as follows:

                 Year ending December 31,         Amount

                     1997                      41,544,074
                     1998                      36,779,305

                     Thereafter               146,240,248
                                              -----------
                           Total            $ 306,327,057
                                              ===========

     At  December  31,  1996,   the  real  estate   portfolio  as  a  whole  was
     approximately 95.4% leased.

     The shopping centers' tenant base includes  primarily national and regional
     supermarkets,  drug stores,  discount department stores and other retailers
     and, consequently,  the credit risk is concentrated in the retail industry.
     There were no tenants  which  individually  represented  10% or more of the
     Company's  combined  minimum rent.  The combined  annualized  rent from the
     Company's  four largest  retail tenants  represented  approximately  22% of
     annualized minimum rent at December 31, 1996.

9.   Related Party Transactions

     The Company  provides  management,  leasing,  and  brokerage  services  for
     certain  commercial real estate  properties of The Regency Group,  Inc. and
     its affiliates ("TRG"), a corporation  wholly-owned by certain officers and
     stockholders  of the  Company.  Fees for such  services  are charged to TRG
     based on current market rates.

                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


9.   Related Party Transactions (continued)
     
     From  time  to  time,   certain   personnel  of  the  Company  may  provide
administrative  services  to TRG,  pursuant  to an  agreement.  The cost of such
services are  reimbursed  by TRG based on percentage  allocations  of management
time and general overhead made in compliance with applicable  regulations of the
Internal Revenue Service.  The Company received  $95,000,  $194,000 and $204,000
during the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively, which has
been recorded as a reimbursement to general and administrative expenses.

     In connection with and as a condition to the Company's acquisition of
     University Marketplace, TRG entered into a cash flow support agreement with
     the Company.  The  agreement  provided that TRG guarantee the monthly gross
     rental revenue, for a period of three years following the Company's initial
     public  offering for a portion of the anchor  space  vacated by Phar-Mor in
     July 1993. The Company  received $58,034 and $88,882 during the years ended
     December  31,  1995 and  1994,  respectively,  which has been  recorded  as
     recoveries from tenants.

10.  Contingencies

     The Company like others in the commercial real estate industry,  is subject
     to numerous  environmental  laws and  regulations  and the operation of dry
     cleaning  plants  at  the  Company's  shopping  centers  is  the  principal
     environmental  concern.  The Company  believes  that the dry  cleaners  are
     operating  in  accordance   with  current  laws  and  regulations  and  has
     established  procedures to monitor their operations.  While the Company has
     registered  the  plants  located in Florida  under a state  funded  program
     designed  to  substantially  fund  the  clean  up,  if  necessary,  of  any
     environmental  issues,  the  owner or  operator  is not  relieved  from the
     ultimate  responsibility for clean up. The Company also has established due
     diligence  procedures  to identify  and  evaluate  potential  environmental
     issues on properties under  consideration  for  acquisition.  In connection
     with   acquisitions   during  1996  and  1995,   the  Company   established
     environmental reserves of $600,000 and $500,000,  respectively. While it is
     not  possible  to predict  with  certainty,  management  believes  that the
     reserves  are  adequate to cover  future  clean-up  costs  related to these
     sites. The Company's policy is to accrue environmental  clean-up costs when
     it is  probable  that a  liability  has been  incurred  and that  amount is
     reasonably  estimable.   Based  on  information  presently  available,   no
     additional  environmental  accruals were made and management  believes that
     the  ultimate  disposition  of  currently  known  matters  will  not have a
     material effect on the financial position,  liquidity, or operations of the
     Company.

11.  Subsequent Event

     On March 7, 1997, the Company acquired Branch Properties,  L.P. ("Branch"),
     an Atlanta based real estate  partnership that owns,  manages,  leases, and
     develops   shopping  centers  in  the  Southeastern   United  States,   for
     approximately  $190 million.  At the closing,  the Company issued 3,373,801
     redeemable  partnership  units  ("Redeemable  Units") from  Regency  Retail
     Partnership,  L.P.  ("Partnership")  and 155,797  shares of common stock in
     exchange for 100% of the existing  partnership units of Branch, and assumed
     approximately  $112 million of debt excluding the minority interest amount.
     During  the  next  three  years,  Branch  will  have  the  right to earn an
     additional  $23.3 million of Redeemable Units based upon the achievement of
     increased  income  levels.  At closing the Company  acquired from Branch 18
     shopping  centers  comprising 1.9 million  square feet; 8 shopping  centers
     containing  700,000  square feet that are currently  under  development  or
     redevelopment, and management contracts on over 4 million square feet owned
     by third parties.

annual report on Form 10-K for the year 1996.  In connection  with our audits of
the  aforementioned  consolidated  financial  statements,  we also  audited  the
