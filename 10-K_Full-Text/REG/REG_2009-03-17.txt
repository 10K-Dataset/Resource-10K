Forward-Looking Statements

In addition to historical information, the following information contains forward-looking statements as defined under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements include statements about anticipated
changes in our revenues, the size of our development program, earnings per share, returns and portfolio value, and expectations about our liquidity. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and
markets in which Regency Centers Corporation (“Regency” or “Company”) operates, and management’s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain known and
unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in national and local economic conditions
including the impact of a slowing economy; financial difficulties of tenants; competitive market conditions, including timing and pricing of acquisitions and sales of properties and out-parcels; changes in expected leasing activity and market rents;
timing of development starts and sales of properties and out-parcels; meeting development schedules; our inability to exercise voting control over the co-investment partnerships through which we own or develop many of our properties; weather;
consequences of any armed conflict or terrorist attack against the United States; and the ability to obtain governmental approvals. For additional information, see “Risk Factors” elsewhere herein. The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto of Regency Centers Corporation appearing elsewhere within.

PART I

Item 1.

Business

Regency is a qualified real estate
investment trust (“REIT”), which began operations in 1993. Our primary operating and investment goal is long-term growth in earnings and total shareholder return, which we work to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning, operating and
developing high-quality community and neighborhood shopping centers that are tenanted by market-dominant grocers, category-leading anchors, specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population
densities. All of our operating, investing and financing activities are performed through our operating partnership, Regency Centers, L.P. (“RCLP” or “Partnership”), RCLP’s wholly owned subsidiaries, and through its
investments in real estate partnerships with third parties (also referred to as co-investment partnerships or joint ventures). Regency currently owns 99% of the outstanding operating partnership units of RCLP. Because of our structure and certain
public debt financing, RCLP is also a registrant.

At December 31, 2008, we directly owned 224 shopping centers (the
“Consolidated Properties”) located in 24 states representing 24.2 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”). Our cost of these shopping centers and those under development is $4.0 billion before depreciation.
Through co-investment partnerships, we own partial interests in 216 shopping centers (the “Unconsolidated Properties”) located in 27 states and the District of Columbia representing 25.4 million square feet of GLA. Our investment in
the partnerships that own the Unconsolidated Properties is $383.4 million. Certain portfolio information described below is presented (a) on a Combined Basis, which is a total of the Consolidated Properties and the Unconsolidated Properties,
(b) for our Consolidated Properties only and (c) for the Unconsolidated Properties that we own through co-investment partnerships. We believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the
properties that we wholly-own versus those that we indirectly own through entities we do not control, but for which we provide asset management, property management, leasing, investing and financing services. The shopping center portfolio that we
manage, on a Combined Basis, represents 440 shopping centers located in 29 states and the District of Columbia and contains 49.6 million square feet of GLA.

We earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to market-leading grocers, major retail anchors, specialty side-shop retailers, and restaurants, including ground leasing or selling
building pads (out-parcels) to these potential tenants. We experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers, and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers. Community and neighborhood
shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering necessities and services. This high traffic generates increased sales, thereby driving higher occupancy and rental-rate growth, which we expect will sustain our growth in
earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term.

We seek a range of strong national, regional and local
specialty retailers, for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs. We have created a formal partnering process, the Premier
Customer Initiative (“PCI”), to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our specialty retailers. The objective of PCI is for us to build a base of



Index to Financial Statements

specialty tenants who represent the “best-in-class” operators in their respective merchandising categories. Such retailers reinforce the consumer
appeal and other strengths of a center’s anchor, help stabilize a center’s occupancy, reduce re-leasing downtime, reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents.

The current economic recession is resulting in a higher level of retail store closings and is limiting the demand for leasing space in our shopping
centers resulting in a decline in our occupancy percentages and rental revenues. Additionally, certain national tenants negotiate co-tenancy clauses into their lease agreements, which allow them to reduce their rents or close their stores in the
event that a co-tenant closes its store. We believe that our investment focus on neighborhood and community shopping centers that conveniently provide daily necessities will help lessen the current economy’s negative impact to our shopping
centers, although the negative impact could still be significant. We are closely monitoring the operating performance and tenants’ sales in our shopping centers including those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant
changes in competition, business practice, or reductions in sales.

We grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating
centers and new shopping center development, where we acquire the land and construct the building. Development is customer driven, meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction. Developments serve the
growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers, resulting in modern shopping centers with long-term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital. This development process can require three to five years from initial
land or redevelopment acquisition through construction, lease-up and stabilization of rental income, but can take longer depending upon the size of the project. Generally, anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of
construction of the entire center, resulting in rental income during the development phase.

In the near term, reduced new store openings
amongst retailers is resulting in reduced demand for new retail space and is causing corresponding reductions in new leasing rental rates and development pre-leasing. As a result, we are significantly reducing our development program by reducing the
number of new projects started, phasing existing developments that lack retail demand, and reducing related general and administrative expense. Although our development program will continue to be a significant part of our business strategy, new
development projects will be rigorously evaluated in regard to availability of capital, visibility of tenant demand to achieve 95% occupancy, and sufficient investment returns.

We intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth program, which should preserve our investment-grade ratings. Our approach is
founded on our self-funding capital strategy to fund our growth. The culling of non-strategic assets and our industry-leading co-investment partnership program are integral components of this strategy. We also develop certain retail centers because
of their attractive profit margins with the intent of selling them to third parties upon completion. These sales proceeds are re-deployed into new, high-quality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth
and attractive returns. To the extent that we are unable to execute our capital recycling program to generate adequate sources of capital, we will significantly reduce and even stop new investment activity until there is adequate visibility and
reliability to sources of capital for Regency.

Joint venturing of shopping centers provides us with a capital source for new developments
and acquisitions, as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services. As asset manager, we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating, investment, and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the
co-investment partnerships. Co-investment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us. Although selling properties to co-investment partnerships reduces our direct ownership
interest, we continue to share, to the extent of our remaining ownership interest, in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and long-term investment strategy. We have no obligations or liabilities within the
co-investment partnerships beyond our ownership interest.

The current lack of liquidity in the capital markets is having a corresponding
effect on new investment activity in our co-investment partnerships. Our co-investment partnerships have significant levels of debt, 67.5% of which will mature through 2012, and are subject to significant refinancing risks. We anticipate that as
real estate values decline, the refinancing of maturing loans, including those maturing in our joint ventures, will require us and our joint venture partners to contribute our respective pro-rata shares of capital in order to reduce refinancing
requirements to acceptable loan to value levels required for new financings. While we have been successful refinancing maturing loans, the longer-term impact of the current economic crisis on our ability to access capital, including access by our
joint venture partners, or to obtain future financing to fund maturing debt is unclear. While we believe that our partners have sufficient capital or access thereto for these future capital requirements, we can



Index to Financial Statements

provide no assurance that the constrained capital markets will not inhibit their ability to access capital and meet their future funding requirements.

We expect that cash generated from operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our operating expenses, interest expense,
scheduled principal payments on outstanding debt, and capital expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers. We expect to continue paying dividends to our shareholders based upon availability of cash flow and to maintain compliance with
REIT tax laws. The Board of Directors determined that in light of the current recession and the strains it is placing on our business, they will not increase the dividend rate per share during 2009, and may find it necessary to reduce future
dividends or pay a portion of the dividend in the form of stock. The Board of Directors is continuously reviewing Regency’s operations and will make decisions about future dividend payments on a quarterly basis.

Competition

We are among the largest owners of
shopping centers in the nation based on revenues, number of properties, gross leasable area, and market capitalization. There are numerous companies and private individuals engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, and operation of
shopping centers which compete with us in our targeted markets. This results in competition for attracting anchor tenants, as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites. We believe that the principal competitive
factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location, demographics, rental costs, tenant mix, property age, and property maintenance. We believe that our competitive advantages include our locations within our market areas, the design
quality of our shopping centers, the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers, our relationships with our anchor tenants and our side-shop and out-parcel retailers, our PCI program that allows us to provide retailers with multiple
locations, our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers, and our ability to source and develop new shopping centers.

Changes in
Policies

Our Board of Directors establishes the policies that govern our investment and operating strategies including, among others,
development and acquisition of shopping centers, tenant and market focus, debt and equity financing policies, quarterly distributions to stockholders, and REIT tax status. The Board of Directors may amend these policies at any time without a vote of
our stockholders.

Employees

Our
headquarters are located at One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida. We presently maintain 21 market offices nationwide where we conduct management, leasing, construction, and investment activities. At December 31, 2008, we had
511 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Compliance with Governmental Regulations

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic
substances at our shopping centers. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of required remediation and the owner’s
liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent the
property or borrow using the property as collateral. We have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation. Environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material
financial impact on us due to reserves for remediation, insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation, and various state-regulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state.

Executive Officers

The executive officers of the
Company are appointed each year by the Board of Directors. Each of the executive officers has been employed by the Company in the position or positions indicated in the list and pertinent notes below. Each of the executive officers has been employed

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Risk Factors Related to Our Industry and Real
Estate Investments

Our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by poor market conditions where properties are geographically
concentrated.

Our performance depends on the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated. During the year
ended December 31, 2008, our properties in California, Florida and Texas accounted for 58.9% of our consolidated net operating income. Our revenues and cash available for distribution to stockholders could be adversely affected by this
geographic concentration if market conditions, such as supply of retail space or demand for shopping centers, deteriorate in California, Florida, and Texas relative to other geographic areas.

Loss of revenues from major tenants could reduce distributions to stockholders.

We derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as Kroger, Publix and Safeway that occupy more than one center. Distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a
major tenant:

•

becomes bankrupt or insolvent;

•

experiences a downturn in its business;

•

materially defaults on its leases;

•

does not renew its leases as they expire; or

•

renews at lower rental rates.

Vacated anchor space, including space owned by the anchor, can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant’s customer drawing power. Most anchors have the right to vacate
and prevent re-tenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term. If major tenants vacate a property, then other tenants may be entitled to terminate their leases at the property.

Downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow.

Our properties consist primarily of grocery-anchored shopping centers. Our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market
for retail space. The market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by any of the following:

•

weakness in the national, regional and local economies, which could adversely impact consumer spending and retail sales and in turn tenant demand for space and
increased store closings;

•

consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States;

•

the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies;

•

the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector;

•

the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets;

•

increasing consumer purchases through catalogs or the internet;

•

reduction in the demand by tenants to occupy our shopping centers as a result of reduced consumer demand for certain retail formats such as video rental stores;

•

the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

•

changes in taxation and zoning laws;

•

adverse government regulation.

•

the growth of super-centers, such as those operated by Wal-Mart, and their adverse effect on major grocery chains; and

•

the impact of increased energy costs on consumers and its consequential effect on the number of shopping visits to our centers;

To the extent that any of these conditions occur, they are likely to impact market rents for retail space, occupancy in the operating portfolios, our
ability to recycle capital, and our cash available for distribution to stockholders.



Index to Financial Statements

Unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could reduce distributions to
stockholders.

We actively pursue development activities as opportunities arise. Development activities require various government and
other approvals for entitlements which can significantly delay the development process. We may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received. We incur other risks associated with development activities,
including:

•

the ability to lease up developments to full occupancy on a timely basis;

•

the risk that anchor tenants will not open and operate in accordance with their lease agreement;

•

the risk that occupancy rates and rents of a completed project will not be sufficient to make the project profitable and available for contribution to our
co-investment partnerships or sale to third parties;

•

the risk that the current size and continued growth in our development pipeline will strain the organization’s capacity to complete the developments within the
targeted timelines and at the expected returns on invested capital;

•

the risk that we may abandon development opportunities and lose our investment in these developments;

•

the risk that development costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project unprofitable;

•

delays in the development and construction process; and

•

the lack of cash flow during the construction period.

If developments are unsuccessful, funding provided from contributions to co-investment partnerships and sales to third parties may be materially reduced and our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders
will be reduced. Our earnings and cash flow available for distribution to stockholders also may be reduced if we experience a significant slowdown in our development activities.

Uninsured loss may adversely affect distributions to stockholders.

We carry comprehensive
liability, fire, flood, extended coverage, rental loss, and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. We believe that the insurance carried on our properties
is adequate and in accordance with industry standards. There are, however, some types of losses, such as from hurricanes, terrorism, wars or earthquakes, which may be uninsurable, or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically
justifiable. If an uninsured loss occurs, we could lose both the invested capital in and anticipated revenues from the property, but we would still be obligated to repay any recourse mortgage debt on the property. In that event, our distributions to
stockholders could be reduced.

We face competition from numerous sources.

The ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented, with less than 10% owned by real estate investment trusts. We face competition from other real
estate investment trusts as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition, ownership, and leasing of shopping centers. We compete to develop shopping centers with other real estate investment trusts engaged in development activities as well
as with local, regional, and national real estate developers.

We compete in the acquisition of properties through proprietary research
that identifies opportunities in markets with high barriers to entry and higher-than-average population growth and household income. We seek to maximize rents per square foot by (i) establishing relationships with supermarket chains that are
first or second in their markets or other category-leading anchors and (ii) leasing non-anchor space in multiple centers to national or regional tenants. We compete to develop properties by applying our proprietary research methods to identify
development and leasing opportunities and by pre-leasing a significant portion of a center before beginning construction.

There can be no
assurance, however, that other real estate owners or developers will not utilize similar research methods and target the same markets and anchor tenants that we target. These entities may successfully



Index to Financial Statements

control these markets and tenants to our exclusion. If we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets, our cash flow, and therefore distributions to
stockholders, may be adversely affected.

Costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders.

Under various federal, state and local laws, an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of
hazardous or toxic substances on the property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of any required remediation could exceed
the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner.

We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they
apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks (UST’s). The presence of, or the failure to properly
remediate, hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to borrow using the property as collateral. Any of these developments could reduce cash flow and distributions to stockholders.

Risk Factors Related to Our Co-investment Partnerships and Acquisition Structure

We do not have voting control over our joint venture investments, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued.

We have invested as a co-venturer in the acquisition or development of properties. These investments involve risks not present in a wholly-owned project.
We do not have voting control over the ventures. The co-venturer might (1) have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or (2) otherwise impede our objectives. The co-venturer also might become insolvent or
bankrupt.

Our co-investment partnerships account for a significant portion of our revenues and net income in the form of management fees and are an
important part of our growth strategy. The termination of our co-investment partnerships could adversely affect distributions to stockholders.

Our management fee income has increased significantly as our participation in co-investment partnerships has increased. If co-investment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason, we would lose the
asset and property management fees from these co-investment partnerships, which could adversely affect our cash available for distribution to stockholders.

In addition, termination of the co-investment partnerships without replacing them with new co-investment partnerships could adversely affect our growth strategy. Property sales to the co-investment partnerships
provide us with an important source of funding for additional developments and acquisitions. Without this source of capital, our ability to recycle capital, fund developments and acquisitions, and increase distributions to stockholders could be
adversely affected.

Our co-investment partnerships have significant levels of debt, 67.5% of which will mature through 2012, and are
subject to significant refinancing risks. We anticipate that as real estate values decline, the refinancing of maturing loans, including those maturing in our joint ventures, will require us and our joint venture partners to contribute our
respective pro-rata shares of capital in order to reduce refinancing requirements to acceptable loan to value levels required for new financings. The long-term impact of the current economic crisis on our ability to access capital, including access
by our joint venture partners, or to obtain future financing to fund maturing debt is unclear.

Our partnership structure may limit our flexibility to
manage our assets.

We invest in retail shopping centers through Regency Centers, L.P., the operating partnership in which we currently
own 99% of the outstanding common partnership units. From time to time, we acquire properties through our operating partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests. This acquisition structure may permit limited partners who contribute
properties to us to defer some, if not all, of the income tax liability that they would incur if they sold the property for cash.



Index to Financial Statements

Properties contributed to our operating partnership may have unrealized gains attributable to the
difference between the fair market value and adjusted tax basis in the properties prior to contribution. As a result, our sale of these properties could cause adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contributed them.

Generally, our operating partnership has no obligation to consider the tax consequences of its actions to any limited partner. However, our operating
partnership may acquire properties in the future subject to material restrictions on refinancing or resale designed to minimize the adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contribute those properties. These restrictions could
significantly reduce our flexibility to manage our assets by preventing us from reducing mortgage debt or selling a property when such a transaction might be in our best interest in order to reduce interest costs or dispose of an under-performing
property.

Risk Factors Related to Our Capital Recycling and Capital Structure

Lack of available credit could reduce capital available for new developments and other investments and could increase refinancing risks.

The lack of available credit in the commercial real estate market is causing a decline in the sale of shopping centers and their values. This reduces the
available capital for new developments or other new investments, which is a key part of our capital recycling strategy. The lack of liquidity in the capital markets has also resulted in a significant increase in the cost to refinance maturing loans
and a significant increase in refinancing risks. We anticipate that as real estate values decline, refinancing maturing secured loans, including those maturing in our joint ventures, may require us and our joint venture partners to contribute our
respective pro-rata shares of capital in order to reduce refinancing requirements to acceptable loan to value levels required for new financings. At this time, it is unclear whether and to what extent the actions taken by the U.S. government
currently being implemented or contemplated, will mitigate the effects of the economic crisis within the United States. While we currently have no immediate need to access the credit markets, the impact of the current economic crisis on our ability
to access capital, including access by our joint venture partners, or to obtain future financing to fund maturing debt is unclear.

A reduction in the
availability of capital, an increase in the cost of capital, and higher market capitalization rates could adversely impact Regency’s ability to recycle capital and fund developments and acquisitions, and could dilute earnings.

As part of our capital recycling program, we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards. We also develop certain retail
centers because of their attractive margins with the intent of selling them to co-investment partnerships or other third parties for a profit. These sale proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments. An increase in market
capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale, which would have an adverse impact on our capital recycling program by reducing the amount of cash generated and profits realized. In order to meet the cash
requirements of our development program, we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned, which would have a dilutive impact on our earnings.

Our debt financing may reduce distributions to stockholders.

We do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations
to make balloon principal payments when due on our debt. If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we might be forced (i) to dispose of properties, which might result in losses, or (ii) to obtain financing at unfavorable
terms. Either could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stockholders.

In addition, if we cannot make required mortgage
payments, the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage, causing the loss of cash flow from that property. Furthermore, substantially all of our debt is cross-defaulted, which means that a default under one loan could trigger
defaults under other loans.

Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that may be incurred. The degree to which we are
leveraged could have important consequences, including the following:

•

leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to repay indebtedness or for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
development, or other general corporate purposes;

•

leverage could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and



Index to Financial Statements

•

as a result, our leverage could lead to reduced distributions to stockholders.

Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition.

Our revolving line of credit and our unsecured notes contain customary covenants, including compliance with financial ratios, such as ratios of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratios. Our
line of credit also restricts our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control. These covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities. Moreover, if we breach any of these covenants, the
resulting default could cause the acceleration of our indebtedness, even in the absence of a payment default. If we are not able to refinance our indebtedness after a default, or unable to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, distributions
to stockholders and our financial condition would be adversely affected.

We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the
future.

To qualify as a REIT, we must, among other things, distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of our REIT taxable
income (excluding any net capital gains). Because of these distribution requirements, we likely will not be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital for acquisitions or developments, with income from operations. We therefore will
have to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things, including the market’s perception of our growth
potential and our current and potential future earnings. In addition, our line of credit imposes covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing, such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements.

Additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders’ interests, and additional debt financing may substantially increase
our degree of leverage.

Risk Factors Related to Interest Rates and the Market for Our Stock

Increased interest rates may reduce distributions to stockholders.

We are obligated on floating rate debt, and if we do not eliminate our exposure to increases in interest rates through interest rate protection or cap agreements, these increases may reduce cash flow and our ability
to make distributions to stockholders.

Although swap agreements enable us to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and cap
agreements enable us to cap our maximum interest rate, they expose us to the risk that the counterparties to these hedge agreements may not perform, which could increase our exposure to rising interest rates. If we enter into swap agreements,
decreases in interest rates will increase our interest expense as compared to the underlying floating rate debt. This could result in our making payments to unwind these agreements, such as in connection with a prepayment of the floating rate debt.

Increased market interest rates could reduce our stock prices.

The annual dividend rate on our common stock as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of our stock. An increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers to demand a higher annual
dividend rate, which could adversely affect the market price of our stock. A decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets. Selling common stock at a decreased market price
would have a dilutive impact on existing shareholders.

Risk Factors Related to Federal Income Tax Laws

If we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.

We believe that we qualify for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the
requirements for taxation as a REIT. If we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and
complex. The determination that we are a REIT requires an



Index to Financial Statements

analysis of various factual matters and circumstances, some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of
interpretation. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from specific passive sources, like rent, that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court would agree with the
positions we have taken in interpreting the REIT requirements. We also are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding capital gains. The fact that we hold many of our assets through co-investment
partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, Congress and the Internal Revenue Service might make changes to
the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings, that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a REIT.

Also, unless the IRS granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year we first failed to qualify. If we failed to qualify as a REIT, we
would have to pay significant income taxes and this would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities. In addition, we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders.

Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to pay certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.
For example, if we have net income from “prohibited transactions,” that income will be subject to a 100% tax. In general, prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the
ordinary course of business. The determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale. While we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years, we
do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions, but there can be no assurance that the IRS would not contend otherwise.

In addition, any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable affiliates, including Regency Realty Group, Inc., our taxable REIT subsidiary, is subject to federal and state corporate income tax. Several
provisions of the laws applicable to REIT’s and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable REIT subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation. For example, a taxable REIT subsidiary is limited in its ability to
deduct interest payments made to an affiliated REIT. In addition, a REIT has to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that it receives if the economic arrangements between the REIT, the REIT’s tenants and the taxable REIT subsidiary are not
comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties. Finally, some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a REIT we are not subject to federal income tax on that income. To the extent that we and our
affiliates are required to pay federal, state and local taxes, we will have less cash available for distributions to our stockholders.

A
REIT may not own securities in any one issuer if the value of those securities exceeds 5% of the value of the REIT’s total assets or the securities owned by the REIT represent more than 10% of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities or
10% of the value of the issuer’s outstanding securities. An exception to these tests allows a REIT to own securities of a subsidiary that exceed the 5% value test and the 10% value tests if the subsidiary elects to be a “taxable REIT
subsidiary.” We are not able to own securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 25% of the value of our total assets. We currently own more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of
Regency Realty Group, Inc., which has elected to be a taxable REIT subsidiary.

Risk Factors Related to Our Ownership Limitations, the Florida
Business Corporation Act and Certain Other Matters

Restrictions on the ownership of our capital stock to preserve our REIT status could delay or
prevent a change in control.

Ownership of more than 7% by value of our outstanding capital stock by certain persons is restricted for
the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a REIT, with certain exceptions. This 7% limitation may discourage a change in control and may also (i) deter tender offers for our capital stock, which offers may be attractive to our
stockholders, or (ii) limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7% of our outstanding capital stock or to effect
a change in control.

The issuance of our capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control.

Our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 10,000,000 shares of special
common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares

issued. The issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in
control were in our stockholders’ interest. The provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from
voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders.

Item 5.

Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “REG”. As of February 24, 2009, we had
approximately 20,500 stockholders of record. The following table sets forth the high and low prices and the cash dividends declared on our common stock by quarter for 2008 and 2007.

We intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to our common stockholders. Future distributions
will be declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon cash generated by operating activities, our financial condition, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deem relevant. Distributions by us to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes will be taxable to
stockholders as either ordinary dividend income or capital gain income if so declared by us. Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital. Such distributions have the effect of
deferring taxation until the sale of a stockholder’s common stock. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income. Under certain circumstances, which we
do not expect to occur, we could be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distributions in order to meet such requirements. We currently maintain the Regency Centers Corporation Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
which enables our stockholders to automatically reinvest distributions, as well as make voluntary cash payments towards the purchase of additional shares.

Under the loan agreement of our line of credit, in the event of any monetary default, we may not make distributions to stockholders except to the extent necessary to maintain our REIT status.

Selected Financial Data

(in thousands, except
per share data, number of properties, and ratio of earnings to fixed charges)

The following table sets forth Selected Financial Data
for Regency on a historical basis for the five years ended December 31, 2008. This historical Selected Financial Data has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as reclassified for discontinued operations. As previously
disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 12, 2009, our Audit Committee determined on March 12, 2009, after discussions with management, that our previously-issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter
and nine months ended September 30, 2008, should no longer be relied upon because of an error in our calculation of the gain on sale of properties to certain co-investment partnerships (DIK-JVs). Such error came to light as a result of the
determination that for certain of our co-investment partnerships, the in-kind liquidation provisions contained within such co-investment partnership agreements constitute in-substance call/put options, a form of continuing involvement under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate”. As a result, the Company has reevaluated its accounting policy for such sales and has adopted a Restricted Gain Method of gain recognition, as
described more fully in our Critical Accounting Policies, which considers the Company’s ability to receive property previously sold to a co-investment partnership upon liquidation. The revised method of recognizing gain on sale of properties to
co-investment partnerships with in-kind liquidation provisions has been applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, in the financial data presented below, the Company
corrected its reported gains on sales of properties in 2005 and 2004. There was no impact to gains on sale of properties in 2007 or 2006. The Company also recorded a correction to previously reported real estate investments before accumulated
depreciation, total assets, minority interests, and stockholders’ equity in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 related to the cumulative correction of gains reported during the periods 2001 to 2005 as described in the notes below. This information
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Regency (including the related notes thereto) and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations, each included elsewhere in
this Form 10-K.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview of Our Operating Strategy

Regency is a qualified real estate investment trust
(“REIT”), which began operations in 1993. Our primary operating and investment goal is long-term growth in earnings and total shareholder return, which we work to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning, operating and developing
high-quality community and neighborhood shopping centers that are tenanted by market-dominant grocers, category-leading anchors, specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities. All
of our operating, investing and financing activities are performed through our operating partnership, Regency Centers, L.P. (“RCLP” or “Partnership”), RCLP’s wholly owned subsidiaries, and through its investments in real
estate partnerships with third parties (also referred to as co-investment partnerships or joint ventures). Regency currently owns 99% of the outstanding operating partnership units of RCLP.

At December 31, 2008, we directly owned 224 shopping centers (the “Consolidated Properties”) located in 24 states representing
24.2 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”). Our cost of these shopping centers and those under development is $4.0 billion before depreciation. Through co-investment partnerships, we own partial ownership interests in 216
shopping centers (the “Unconsolidated Properties”) located in 27 states and the District of Columbia representing 25.4 million square feet of GLA. Our investment in the partnerships that own the Unconsolidated Properties is $383.4
million. Certain portfolio information described below is presented (a) on a Combined Basis, which is a total of the Consolidated Properties and the Unconsolidated Properties, (b) for our Consolidated Properties only and (c) for the
Unconsolidated Properties that we own through co-investment partnerships. We believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we wholly-own versus those that we indirectly own
through entities we do not control, but for which we provide asset management, property management, leasing, investing and financing services. The shopping center portfolio that we manage, on a Combined Basis, represents 440 shopping centers located
in 29 states and the District of Columbia and contains 49.6 million square feet of GLA.

We earn revenues and generate cash flow by
leasing space in our shopping centers to market-leading grocers, major retail anchors, specialty side-shop retailers, and restaurants, including ground leasing or selling building pads (out-parcels) to these potential tenants. We experience growth
in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers, and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers. Community and neighborhood shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering
necessities and services. This high traffic generates increased sales, thereby driving higher occupancy and rental-rate growth, which we expect will sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term.

We seek a range of strong national, regional and local specialty retailers, for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with
leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs. We have created a formal partnering process, the Premier Customer Initiative (“PCI”), to promote mutually beneficial relationships with
our specialty retailers. The objective of PCI is for us to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the “best-in-class” operators in their respective merchandising categories. Such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other
strengths of a center’s anchor, help stabilize a center’s occupancy, reduce re-leasing downtime, reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents.

The current economic recession is resulting in a higher level of retail store closings and is limiting the demand for leasing space in our shopping centers resulting in a decline in our occupancy percentages and
rental revenues. Additionally, certain national tenants negotiate co-tenancy clauses into their lease agreements, which allow them to reduce their rents or close their stores in the event that a co-tenant closes their store. We believe that our
investment focus on neighborhood and community shopping centers that conveniently provide daily necessities will help lessen the current economy’s negative impact to our shopping centers, although the negative impact could still be significant.
We are



Index to Financial Statements

closely monitoring the operating performance and tenants’ sales in our shopping centers including those tenants operating retail formats that are
experiencing significant changes in competition, business practice, or reductions in sales.

We grow our shopping center portfolio through
acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development, where we acquire the land and construct the building. Development is customer driven, meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction.
Developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers, resulting in modern shopping centers with long-term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital. This development process can require three to five
years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction, lease-up and stabilization of rental income, but can take longer depending upon the size of the project. Generally, anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the
completion of construction of the entire center, resulting in rental income during the development phase.

In the near term, reduced new
store openings amongst retailers is resulting in reduced demand for new retail space and is causing corresponding reductions in new leasing rental rates and development pre-leasing. As a result, we are significantly reducing our development program
by reducing the number of new projects started, phasing existing developments that lack retail demand, and reducing related general and administrative expense. Although our development program will continue to be a significant part of our business
strategy, new development projects will be rigorously evaluated in regard to availability of capital, visibility of tenant demand to achieve 95% occupancy, and sufficient investment returns.

We intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth program, which should preserve our investment-grade ratings. Our approach is
founded on our self-funding capital strategy to fund our growth. The culling of non-strategic assets and our industry-leading co-investment partnership program are integral components of this strategy. We also develop certain retail centers because
of their attractive profit margins with the intent of selling them to third parties upon completion. These sales proceeds are re-deployed into new, high-quality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth
and attractive returns. To the extent that we are unable to execute our capital recycling program to generate adequate sources of capital, we will significantly reduce and even stop new investment activity until there is adequate visibility and
reliability to sources of capital for Regency.

Joint venturing of shopping centers provides us with a capital source for new developments
and acquisitions, as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services. As asset manager, we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating, investment, and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the
co-investment partnerships. Co-investment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us. Although selling properties to co-investment partnerships reduces our direct ownership
interest, we continue to share, to the extent of our ownership interest, in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and long-term investment strategy. We have no obligations or liabilities within the
co-investment partnerships beyond our ownership interest.

The current lack of liquidity in the capital markets is having a corresponding
effect on new investment activity in our co-investment partnerships. Our co-investment partnerships have significant levels of debt, 67.5% of which will mature through 2012, and are subject to significant refinancing risks. We anticipate that as
real estate values decline, the refinancing of maturing loans, including those maturing in our joint ventures, will require us and our joint venture partners to contribute our respective pro-rata shares of capital in order to reduce refinancing
requirements to acceptable loan to value levels required for new financings. While we have been successful refinancing maturing loans, the longer-term impact of the current economic crisis on our ability to access capital, including access by our
joint venture partners, or to obtain future financing to fund maturing debt is unclear. While we believe that our partners have sufficient capital or access thereto for these future capital requirements, we can provide no assurance that the
constrained capital markets will not inhibit their ability to access capital and meet their future funding requirements.

We seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through diversification which we achieve by geographically diversifying our shopping centers, avoiding
dependence on any single property, market, or tenant, and owning a portion of our shopping centers through co-investment partnerships.

The
following table summarizes our four largest grocery tenants occupying the shopping centers at December 31, 2008:

(b)

GLA and annualized base rent include the Consolidated Properties plus Regency’s pro-rata share of the

Although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy are
given the right to cancel any or all of their leases and close related stores, or continue to operate. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could
experience a significant reduction in our revenues. We are closely monitoring industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who



Index to Financial Statements

might be experiencing financial difficulties as a result of slowing sales, lack of credit, changes in retail formats or increased competition, especially in
light of the current downturn in the economy. As a result of our findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific
retailer.

In October 2007, Movie Gallery filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. We currently have 21 Movie Gallery stores occupying
our shopping centers. The annual base rent on a pro-rata basis associated with these 21 stores is approximately $1.2 million or less than 1%. At December 31, 2008, we were closely monitoring leases with 107 video rental stores including Movie
Gallery representing $7.8 million of annual base rent on a pro-rata basis.

In May 2008, Linens-n-Things (“LNT”) filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. LNT has closed all five stores in our shopping centers. The annual base rent associated with these five stores is approximately $452,000 or less than 1% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis.

In November 2008, Circuit City filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Circuit City has rejected all three leases in our shopping centers. The annual
base rent associated with these stores is $1.1 million or less than 1% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis.

In November 2008,
Brooke Investments filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Brooke Investments has closed all five stores in our shopping centers. The annual base rent associated with these five stores is approximately $127,000 or less than 1% of our annual base
rent on a pro-rata basis.

In December 2008, Bally’s Total Fitness filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Bally’s Total
Fitness has rejected one lease in our shopping centers. The annual base rent on a pro-rata basis associated with this store is approximately $331,000 or less than 1%.

In February 2009, S&K Menswear filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. S&K Menswear has rejected two leases in our shopping centers. The annual base rent on a pro-rata basis associated with these stores is
approximately $89,000 or less than 1%.

We continue to monitor tenants who have announced store closings. Starbucks recently announced that
it would close approximately 900 of its stores. Of the 900 stores, Starbucks has closed two stores in our shopping centers and four are expected to close. The annual base rent associated with these six stores is approximately $251,000 or less than
1% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis. Washington Mutual has also closed two stores in our shopping centers. The annual base rent on a pro-rata basis associated with these two stores is approximately $208,000 or less than 1%.

We expect as the current economic downturn continues, additional retailers will announce store closings and/or bankruptcies that could affect our
shopping centers. We are not aware at this time of the bankruptcy of any other tenants in our shopping centers that would cause a significant reduction in our revenues. No tenant represents more than 6% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The
following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 (in thousands):



Index to Financial Statements

We expect that cash generated from operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our
operating expenses, interest expense, scheduled principal payments on outstanding debt, and capital expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we incurred capital expenditures to maintain our shopping
centers of $15.4 million, $15.1 million, and $14.0 million; we paid scheduled principal payments of $4.8 million, $4.5 million and $4.5 million to our lenders on mortgage loans; and we paid dividends to our stockholders and unit holders of $222.9
million, $204.3 million, and $185.2 million, respectively. During 2008 our annual dividend per common share increased by 9.8%. We expect to continue paying dividends to our shareholders based upon availability of cash flow and to maintain compliance
with REIT tax laws. On February 3, 2009, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.725 per share, payable on March 4, 2009 to shareholders of record on February 18, 2009 and determined that it in light of the
current recession and the strains it is placing on our business, they will not increase the dividend rate per share during 2009, and may find it necessary to reduce future dividends or pay a portion of the dividend in the form of stock. The Board of
Directors continuously reviews Regency’s operations and will make decisions about future dividend payments on a quarterly basis.

At
December 31, 2008 we had 45 properties under construction or undergoing major renovations on a Combined Basis, which when completed, will represent a net investment of $993.2 million after projected sales of adjacent land and out-parcels. This
compares to 49 properties that were under construction at December 31, 2007 representing an investment of $1.1 billion upon completion. We estimate that we will earn an average return on investment from our current development projects of 7.5%
on a fully allocated basis including direct internal costs and the cost to acquire any residual ownership interests held by minority development partners. Average returns have declined over previous years primarily as a result of higher costs
associated with the acquisition of land and construction. Returns are also being pressured by reduced competition among retailers resulting in declining rental rates. Costs necessary to complete the current development projects, net of
reimbursements and projected land sales, are estimated to be approximately $141.9 million and will likely be expended through 2012. The costs to complete these developments will be funded from our $941.5 million Unsecured credit facilities (defined
under Notes Payable), which had $643.8 million of available funding at December 31, 2008. The Unsecured credit facilities mature in 2011 but $600.0 million contains a one year extension option as discussed further below.

Our strategy is to continue growing our shopping center portfolio by investing in shopping centers through new development or by acquiring existing
centers, while at the same time selling non-performing shopping centers and a percentage of our completed developments as a means to generate the capital required by this new investment activity. In the near term, reduced store demand or failures
among national retailers is resulting in reduced demand for new retail space and is causing corresponding reductions in new leasing rental rates and development pre-leasing. As a result, we have significantly reduced our development program by
reducing the number of new projects started, phasing existing developments that lack retail demand, and reducing related general and administrative expense. Also, to the extent that we are unable to execute our capital recycling program in the
current economic environment in order to generate new capital, or we find it necessary to provide financing to buyers of our shopping centers resulting in reduced sales proceeds, we will significantly reduce, and if necessary, stop new investment
activity until the capital markets become less volatile.

We expect to repay maturing secured mortgage loans and credit lines primarily
from similar new issues. We have $25.1 million of secured mortgage loans maturing through 2010. Our joint ventures have $936.5 million of secured mortgage loans and credit lines maturing through 2010, and our pro-rata share is $248.8 million. We
believe that in order to refinance the maturing joint venture loans, we, along with our partners, will likely be required to contribute our pro-rata share based on our respective ownership interest percentage of the capital necessary to reduce the
refinancing amounts to acceptable loan to value levels required for this type of financing in the current capital markets environment. Currently, the expected partner capital requirements for maturing debt in our joint ventures is estimated to be in
a range of 20% - 30% of the loan balances at maturity based upon prevailing market terms at the time of refinancing. We would fund our pro-rata share of a capital call, if any, from our Unsecured credit facilities. We believe that our partners have
sufficient capital or access thereto for these future capital

requirements, however, we can provide no assurance that the current economic crisis will not inhibit their ability to access capital and meet their future
funding requirements. A more detailed loan maturity schedule is included below under Notes Payable.

We would expect that maturing
unsecured public debt would be repaid from the proceeds of similar new unsecured issues in the future if those capital markets are available, although in the current environment, new issues are significantly more expensive than historical issues. To
the extent that issuing unsecured debt in the public markets is cost prohibitive or unavailable, we believe that we have sufficient unsecured assets that we could finance with secured mortgages and repay the unsecured public debt. We have $50.0
million and $160.0 million of public debt maturing in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The joint ventures are not rated and therefore do not issue and have no unsecured public debt outstanding.

Although common or preferred equity raised in the public markets is a funding option, given the state of the current capital markets, our access to these
markets may be limited. When the conditions for the issuance of equity are more favorable, we might consider issuing equity to fund new investment opportunities, fund our development program or repay maturing debt, which would result in dilution to
our existing shareholders. We would also consider issuing equity as part of a financing plan to maintain our leverage ratios at acceptable levels as determined by our Board of Directors. At December 31, 2008, we had an unlimited amount
available under our shelf registration for equity securities and RCLP had an unlimited amount available under its shelf registration for debt.

Investments in Real Estate Partnerships

We account for certain investments in real estate partnerships using the equity
method. We have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R) “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(“FIN 46(R)”) and do not require consolidation under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5 “Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the
Limited Partners Have Certain Rights” (“EITF 04-5”) or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) Statement of Position 78-9, “Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures”
(“SOP 78-9”), and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting. Major decisions, including property acquisitions not meeting pre-established investment criteria, dispositions, financings, annual
budgets and dissolution of the ventures are subject to the approval of all partners.

We account for profit recognition on sales of real
estate in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate” (“Statement 66”). Recognition of gains from sales to co-investment partnerships is
recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest unless there are certain provisions in the partnership agreement which allow the Company a unilateral right to initiate a distribution in kind (“DIK”)
upon liquidation, as described further below under our Critical Accounting Policies and Note 1(b) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements each included herein. The presence of such DIK provisions requires
that we apply a more restrictive method of gain recognition (“Restricted Gain Method”) on sales of properties to these co-investment partnerships. This method considers our potential ability to receive property through a DIK on which
partial gain has been recognized, and ensures maximum gain deferral upon sale to a partnership containing these unilateral DIK rights (“DIK-JV”). We have concluded, through consultation with our auditors and the staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), that these dissolution provisions constitute in-substance call/put options under the guidance of Statement 66, and represent a form of continuing involvement with respect to property that we sold to these DIK-JV’s.

The operations and gains related to properties sold to our investments in all real estate partnerships are not recorded as discontinued
operations because we continue to provide to these shopping centers property management services under market rate agreements with our co-investment partnerships. For those properties acquired by the joint venture from unrelated parties, we are
required to



Index to Financial Statements

contribute our pro-rata share based on our ownership interest of the purchase price to the partnerships.

At December 31, 2008, we had investments in real estate partnerships of $383.4 million. The following table is a summary of unconsolidated combined
assets and liabilities of these co-investment partnerships and our pro-rata share (see note below) at December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands):

Investments in real estate partnerships are primarily composed of co-investment partnerships where
we invest with three co-investment partners and an open-end real estate fund (“Regency Retail Partners” or the “Fund”), as further described below. In addition to earning our pro-rata share of net income or loss in each of these
partnerships, we receive market-based fees for asset management, property management, leasing, investment, and financing services. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we received fees from these co-investment partnerships of $31.7 million, $29.1 million,
and $22.1 million, respectively. Our investments in real estate partnerships as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 consist of the following (in thousands):

Investments in real estate partnerships are reported net of deferred gains of $87.2 million and
$69.5 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. After applying the Restricted Gain Method, cumulative deferred gains in 2007 have increased by $30.5 million to correct gains from partial sales recorded during the periods 2001 to 2005
and have been noted as restated. Cumulative deferred gain amounts related to each co-investment partnership are described below.



Index to Financial Statements

We co-invest with the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund (“OPERF”) in three co-investment
partnerships, two of which we have ownership interests of 20% (“Columbia” and “Columbia II”) and one in which we have an ownership interest of 30% (“Cameron”). Our investment in the three co-investment partnerships with
OPERF totals $62.0 million and represents 1.5% of our total assets at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Columbia co-investment partnerships had total assets of $762.7 million and net income of $11.0 million. Our share of the
co-investment partnerships’ total assets and net income was $164.8 million and $2.2 million, respectively, which represents 4.0% of our total assets and 1.9% of our net income available for common stockholders, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, Columbia owned 14 shopping centers, had total assets of $321.9 million, and net income of $10.2 million for the year ended.
We have a unilateral DIK right to liquidate the partnership; therefore, we have applied the Restricted Gain Method to determine the amount of gain that we recognize on property sales to Columbia. During 2006 to 2008, we did not sell any properties
to Columbia. Since its inception in 2001, we have recognized gain of $2.0 million on partial sales to Columbia and deferred gain of $4.3 million. In December 2008, we earned and recognized a $19.7 million Portfolio Incentive Return fee from OPERF
based on Columbia’s outperformance of the cumulative NCREIF index since the inception of the partnership and a hurdle rate as outlined in the partnership agreement.

As of December 31, 2008, Columbia II owned 16 shopping centers, had total assets of $327.5 million, and net income of $1.1 million for the year ended. During 2008, Columbia II purchased one operating property
from a third party for a purchase price of $28.5 million and we contributed $5.7 million for our proportionate share. We have a unilateral DIK right to liquidate the partnership; therefore, we have applied the Restricted Gain Method to determine the
amount of gain that we recognize on property sales to Columbia II. In September 2008, Columbia II acquired three completed development properties from us for a purchase price of $83.4 million, and as a result, we recognized gain of $9.1 million and
deferred gain of $15.7 million. As more thoroughly described in Note 18 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, the amount of gain previously recorded during September 2008 was subsequently adjusted by a reduction of $10.6 million.
During 2006 and 2007, we did not sell any properties to Columbia II. Since the inception of Columbia II in 2004, we have recognized gain of $9.1 million on partial sales to Columbia II and deferred gain of $15.7 million. During 2008, Columbia II
sold one shopping center to an unrelated party for $13.8 million and recognized a gain of approximately $256,000.

As of December 31,
2008, Cameron owned one shopping center, had total assets of $113.3 million, and a net loss of approximately $187,000 for the year ended. The partnership agreement does not contain any DIK provisions that would require us to apply the Restricted
Gain Method. Since its inception in 2004, we have not sold any properties to Cameron.

We co-invest with the California State
Teachers’ Retirement System (“CalSTRS”) in a joint venture (“RegCal”) in which we have a 25% ownership interest. As of December 31, 2008, RegCal owned seven shopping centers, had total assets of $158.1 million, and net
income of $5.9 million for the year ended. RegCal’s total assets and net income represent 1% and 1.3% of our total assets and net income available for common stockholders, respectively. We have a unilateral DIK right to liquidate the
partnership; therefore, we have applied the Restricted Gain Method to determine the amount of gain that we recognize on property sales to RegCal. During 2006 to 2008, we did not sell any properties to RegCal. Since its inception in 2004, we have
recognized gain of $10.1 million on partial sales to RegCal and deferred gain of $3.4 million. During 2008, RegCal sold one shopping center to an unrelated party for $9.5 million and recognized a gain of $4.2 million.

We co-invest with Macquarie CountryWide Trust of Australia (“MCW”) in five co-investment partnerships two in which we have an ownership
interest of 25% (collectively “MCWR I”), two in which we have an ownership interest of 24.95% (“MCWR II” and “MCWR III”), and one in which we have an ownership interest of 16.35% (“MCWR-DESCO”). Our investment
in the five co-investment partnerships with MCW totals $235.0 million and represents 5.7% of our total assets at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, MCW had total assets of $3.4 billion and net income of $11.6 million. Our share of



Index to Financial Statements

the co-investment partnerships’ total assets and net income was $823.9 million and $2.1 million, respectively, which represents 19.9% of our total
assets and 1.8% of our net income available for common stockholders, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, MCWR I owned 42 shopping
centers, had total assets of $593.9 million, and net income of $11.1 million for the year ended. We have a unilateral DIK right to liquidate the partnership; therefore, we have applied the Restricted Gain Method to determine the amount of gain we
recognize on property sales to MCWR I. During 2006 to 2008, we did not sell any properties to MCWR I. Since its inception in 2001, we have recognized gains of $27.5 million on partial sales to MCWR I and deferred gains of $46.9 million. Subsequent
to December 31, 2008, under the terms of the MCWR I partnership agreement, MCW elected to dissolve the partnership. In January 2009, we began liquidating the partnership through a DIK, which provides for distributing the properties to each
partner under an alternating selection process, ultimately in proportion to the value of each partner’s respective partnership interest as determined by appraisal. The total value of the properties based on appraisals, net of debt, is estimated
to be approximately $482.7 million. The properties which we receive through the DIK will be recorded at the amount of the carrying value of our equity investment, net of deferred gain. The dissolution is expected to be completed during 2009 subject
to required lender consents for ownership transfer.

As of December 31, 2008, MCWR II owned 85 shopping centers, had total assets of
$2.4 billion and net income of $5.6 million for the year ended. During 2008, MCWR II sold a portfolio of seven shopping centers to an unrelated party for $108.1 million and recognized a gain of $8.9 million. At December 31, 2008, the
partnership agreement did not contain any DIK provisions that would require us to apply the Restricted Gain Method. However, in January 2009, the partnership agreement was amended to include DIK provisions; therefore, we will apply the Restricted
Gain Method if additional properties are sold to MCWR II in the future. During the period 2006 to 2008, we did not sell any properties to MCWR II. Since its inception in 2005, we have recognized gain of $2.3 million on partial sales to MCWR II and
deferred gain of approximately $766,000. In June 2008, we earned additional acquisition fees of $5.2 million (the “Contingent Acquisition Fees”) deferred from the original acquisition date since we achieved the cumulative targeted income
levels specified in the Amended and Restated Income Target Agreement between Regency and MCW dated March 22, 2006. The Contingent Acquisition Fees recognized were limited to that percentage of MCWR II, or 75.05%, of the joint venture not owned
by us and amounted to $3.9 million.

As of December 31, 2008, MCWR III owned four shopping centers, had total assets of $67.5 million,
and a net loss of approximately $238,000 for the year ended. At December 31, 2008, the partnership agreement did not contain any DIK provisions that would require us to apply the Restricted Gain Method. However, in January 2009, the partnership
agreement was amended to include DIK provisions; therefore, we will apply the Restricted Gain Method if additional properties are sold to MCWR III in the future. Since its inception in 2005, we have recognized gain of $14.1 million on partial sales
to MCWR III and deferred gain of $4.7 million.

As of December 31, 2008, MCWR-DESCO owned 32 shopping centers, had total assets of
$395.6 million and recorded a net loss of $4.9 million for the year ended primarily related to depreciation and amortization expense, but produced positive cash flow from operations. The partnership agreement does not contain any DIK provisions that
would require us to apply the Restricted Gain Method. Since its inception in 2007, we have not sold any properties to MCWR-DESCO.

We
co-invest with Regency Retail Partners (the “Fund”), an open-ended, infinite life investment fund in which we have an ownership interest of 20%. As of December 31, 2008, the Fund owned nine shopping centers, had total assets of $381.2
million, and recorded a net loss of $2.1 million for the year ended. The Fund represents 1.8% and less than 1% of our total assets and net income available for common stockholders, respectively. During 2008, the Fund purchased one shopping center
from a third party for $93.3 million that included $66.0 million of assumed mortgage debt and we contributed $18.7 million for our proportionate share of the purchase price. During 2008, the Fund also acquired one property in development from us for
a sales price of $74.5 million and we recognized a gain of $4.7



Index to Financial Statements

million after excluding our ownership interest. The partnership agreement does not contain any DIK provisions that would require us to apply the Restricted
Gain Method. Since its inception in 2006, we have recognized gains of $71.6 million on partial sales to the Fund and deferred gains of $17.9 million.

Contractual Obligations

We have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans, unsecured notes, and our Unsecured credit
facilities as described further below. We have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center. In addition,
we have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business. The table excludes reserves for approximately $3.2 million related to environmental remediation as discussed below under Environmental Matters as
the timing of the remediation is not currently known. The table also excludes obligations related to construction or development contracts because payments are only due upon satisfactory performance under the contract. Costs necessary to complete
the 49 development projects currently in process are estimated to be $141.9 million and will likely be expended through 2012.

The
following table of Contractual Obligations summarizes our debt maturities including interest, (excluding recorded debt premiums or discounts that are not obligations), and our obligations under non-cancelable operating and ground leases as of
December 31, 2008 including our pro-rata share of obligations within unconsolidated co-investment partnerships excluding interest (in thousands):

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have

Notes Payable

Outstanding debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007 consists of the following (in thousands):



Index to Financial Statements

During 2008, we placed a $62.5 million mortgage loan on a property. The loan has a nine-year term
and is interest only at an all-in coupon rate of 6.0% (or 230 basis points over an interpolated 9-year US Treasury).

On March 5,
2008, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank and a group of other banks to provide us with a $341.5 million, three-year term loan facility (the “Term Facility”). The Term Facility includes a term loan amount of $227.7
million plus a $113.8 million revolving credit facility that is accessible at our discretion. The term loan has a variable interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 105 basis points which was 3.300% at December 31, 2008 and the revolving portion has a
variable interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 90 basis points. The proceeds from the funding of the Term Facility were used to reduce the balance on the unsecured line of credit (the “Line”). The balance on the term loan was $227.7 million at
December 31, 2008.

During 2007, we entered into a new loan agreement under the Line with a commitment of $600.0 million and the right
to expand the Line by an additional $150.0 million subject to additional lender syndication. The Line has a four-year term with a one-year extension at our option and a current interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points subject to maintaining our
corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings at BBB+.

Contractual interest rates were 1.338% and 5.425% at December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively based on LIBOR plus 40 basis points and LIBOR plus 55 basis points, respectively. The balance on the Line was $70.0 million and $208.0 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Including both the Line commitment and the Term Facility (collectively, “Unsecured credit facilities”), we have $941.5 million of total
capacity and the spread paid is dependent upon our maintaining specific investment-grade ratings. We are also required to comply with certain financial covenants such as Minimum Net Worth, Ratio of Total Liabilities to Gross Asset Value
(“GAV”) and Ratio of Recourse Secured Indebtedness to GAV, Ratio of Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) to Fixed Charges, and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing. As
of December 31, 2008, we are in compliance with all financial covenants for our Unsecured credit facilities. Our Unsecured credit facilities are used primarily to finance the acquisition and development of real estate, but are also available
for general working-capital purposes.

Notes payable consist of secured mortgage loans and unsecured public debt. Mortgage loans may be
prepaid, but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums. Mortgage loans are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest, and mature over various terms through 2018, whereas, interest on unsecured pubic debt is payable
semi-annually and the debt matures over various terms through 2017. We intend to repay mortgage loans at maturity with proceeds from the Unsecured credit facilities. Fixed interest rates on mortgage notes payable range from 5.22% to 8.95% and
average 6.32%. We have one variable rate mortgage loan with an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points that matures in 2009.

At
December 31, 2008, 85.8% of our total debt had fixed interest rates, compared with 89.4% at December 31, 2007. We intend to limit the percentage of variable interest rate debt to be no more than 30% of total debt, which we believe to be an
acceptable risk. Currently, our variable rate debt represents



Index to Financial Statements

14.2% of our total debt. Based upon the variable interest rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2008, if variable interest rates were to increase by 1%,
our annual interest expense would increase by $3.0 million.

The carrying value of our variable rate notes payable and the Unsecured
credit facilities are based upon a spread above LIBOR which is lower than the spreads available in the current credit market, causing the fair value of such variable rate debt to be below its carrying value. The fair value of
fixed rate loans are estimated using cash flows discounted at current market rates available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities. Fixed rate loans assumed in connection with real estate acquisitions are recorded in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements at fair value at the time of acquisition. Based on the estimates used, the fair value of notes payable and the Unsecured credit facilities is approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, scheduled principal repayments on notes payable and the Unsecured credit facilities were as follows (in thousands):

Our investments in real estate partnerships had notes payable of $2.8 billion at December 31, 2008, which mature through 2028, of which 94.0% had
weighted average fixed interest rates of 5.4% and the remaining had variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus a spread in a range of 50 to 200 basis points. Our pro-rata share of these loans was $664.1 million. The loans are primarily
non-recourse, but for those that are guaranteed by a joint venture, our liability does not extend beyond our ownership interest in the joint venture. As of December 31, 2008, scheduled principal repayments on notes payable held by our
investments in real estate partnerships were as follows (in thousands):

We are exposed to capital market risk such as changes in interest rates. In order to manage
the volatility related to interest rate risk, we originate new debt with fixed interest rates, or we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We
account for derivative instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” as amended



Index to Financial Statements

(“Statement 133”). On March 10, 2006, we entered into four forward-starting interest rate swaps totaling $396.7 million with fixed rates of
5.399%, 5.415%, 5.399%, and 5.415%. We designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to fix the rate on $400.0 million of new financing expected to occur in 2010 and 2011, and these proceeds will be used to repay maturing debt at that time. The change
in fair value of these swaps from inception was a liability of $83.7 million at December 31, 2008. The valuation of these derivative instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on
the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and
implied volatilities. To comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“Statement 157”) as amended by FASB Staff Position “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (“FSP FAS
157-2”), we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. Although we have determined that the majority
of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the
likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties.

Equity Transactions

From time to time, we issue equity in the form of exchangeable operating partnership units or preferred units of RCLP, or in the form of common or
preferred stock of Regency Centers Corporation as follows:

Preferred Units

We have issued Preferred Units through RCLP in various amounts since 1998, the net proceeds of which were used to reduce the balance of the Line. We issue
Preferred Units primarily to institutional investors in private placements. Generally, the Preferred Units may be exchanged by the holders for Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock after a specified date at an exchange rate of one share for one
unit. The Preferred Units and the related Preferred Stock are not convertible into our common stock. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, only the Series D Preferred Units were outstanding with a face value of $50.0 million and a fixed distribution
rate of 7.45%. These Units may be called by us beginning September 29, 2009, and have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption. Included in the Series D Preferred Units are original issuance costs of $842,023 that will be expensed if they are
redeemed in the future.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had 468,211 and 473,611 redeemable operating partnership units (“OP
Units”) outstanding, respectively. The redemption value of the redeemable OP Units is based on the closing market price of Regency’s common stock, which was $46.70 per share as of December 31, 2008 and $64.49 per share as of
December 31, 2007, aggregated $21.9 million and $30.5 million, respectively.

Preferred Stock

The Series 3, 4, and 5 preferred shares are perpetual, are not convertible into our common stock, and are redeemable at par upon our election beginning
five years after the issuance date. None of the terms of the Preferred Stock contain any unconditional obligations that would require us to redeem the securities at any time or for any purpose. Terms and conditions of the three series of Preferred
stock outstanding as of December 31, 2008 are summarized as follows:



Index to Financial Statements

On January 1, 2008, we split each share of existing Series 3 and Series 4 Preferred Stock,
each having a liquidation preference of $250 per share and a redemption price of $250 per share into ten shares of Series 3 and Series 4 Stock, respectively, each having a liquidation preference and a redemption price of $25 per share. We then
exchanged each Series 3 and 4 Depositary Share into shares of New Series 3 and 4 Stock, respectively, which have the same dividend rights and other rights and preferences identical to the depositary shares.

Common Stock

At December 31, 2008,
75,634,881 common shares had been issued. The carrying value of the Common stock was $756,349 with a par value of $.01.

Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates

Knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial results, and
discussion and analysis of these results. The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and
expenses during a financial reporting period. These accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical results, current economic activity, and industry accounting standards. They are considered to be critical
because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. We review these estimates on a
periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.

Revenue
Recognition and Tenant Receivables – Tenant receivables represent revenues recognized in our financial statements, and include base rent, percentage rent, and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real
estate taxes. We analyze tenant receivables, historical bad debt levels, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, we analyze the accounts of tenants in
bankruptcy, and we estimate the recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. Our reported net income is directly affected by our estimate of the recoverability of tenant receivables.

Recognition of Gains from the Sales of Real Estate – We account for profit recognition on sales of real estate in accordance with Statement 66. In
summary, profits from sales of real estate are not recognized under the full accrual method by us unless a sale is consummated; the buyer’s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property; a
receivable, if applicable, is not subject to future subordination; we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership; and we do not have substantial continuing involvement with the property.

We sell shopping center properties to joint ventures in exchange for cash equal to the fair value of the percentage interest owned by our partners. We
have accounted for those sales as “partial sales” and recognized gains on those partial sales in the period the properties were sold to the extent of the percentage interest sold under the guidance of Statement 66, and in the case of
certain partnerships, we apply a more restrictive method of recognizing gains, as discussed further below. The gains and operations are not recorded as discontinued operations because we continue to manage these shopping centers.



Index to Financial Statements

Five of our joint ventures (“DIK-JV”) give either partner the unilateral right to elect to
dissolve the partnership and, upon such an election, receive a distribution in-kind (“DIK”) of the assets of the partnership equal to their respective ownership interests. The liquidation procedures would require that all of the properties
owned by the partnership be appraised to determine their respective and collective fair values. As a general rule, if we initiate the liquidation process, our partner has the right to choose the first property that it will receive in liquidation
with the Company having the right to choose the next property that it will receive in liquidation; if our partner initiates the liquidation process, the order of the selection process is reversed. The process then continues with alternating
selection of properties by each partner until the balance of each partner’s capital account on a fair value basis has been distributed. After the final selection, to the extent that the fair value of properties in the DIK-JV are not
distributable in a manner that equals the balance of each partner’s capital account, a cash payment would be made by the partner receiving a fair value in excess of its capital account to the other partner. The partners may also elect to
liquidate some or all of the properties through sales rather than through the DIK process.

We have concluded that these DIK dissolution
provisions constitute in-substance call/put options under the guidance of Statement 66, and represent a form of continuing involvement with respect to property that we sold to these partnerships, limiting our recognition of gain related to the
partial sale. To the extent that the DIK-JV owns more than one property and we are unable to obtain all of the properties we sold to the DIK-JV in liquidation, we apply a more restrictive method of gain recognition (“Restricted Gain
Method”) which considers our potential ability to receive property through a DIK on which partial gain has been recognized, and ensures, as discussed below, maximum gain deferral upon sale to a DIK-JV. We have applied the Restricted Gain Method
to partial sales of property to partnerships that contain such unilateral DIK provisions.

Under current guidance, (Statement 66, paragraph
25), profit shall be recognized by a method determined by the nature and extent of the seller’s continuing involvement and the profit recognized shall be reduced by the maximum exposure to loss. We have concluded that the Restricted Gain Method
accomplishes this objective.

Under the Restricted Gain Method, for purposes of gain deferral, we consider the aggregate pool of properties
sold into the DIK-JV as well as the aggregate pool of properties which will be distributed in the DIK process. As a result, upon the sale of properties to a DIK-JV, we perform a hypothetical DIK liquidation assuming that we would choose only those
properties that we have sold to the DIK-JV in an amount equivalent to our capital account. For purposes of calculating the gain to be deferred, the Company assumes that it will select properties upon a DIK liquidation that generated the highest gain
to the Company when originally sold to the DIK-JV and includes for such determination the fair value in properties that could be received in excess of its capital account. The DIK deferred gain is calculated whenever a property is sold to the DIK-JV
by us. During the years when there are no property sales, the DIK deferred gain is not recalculated.

Because the contingency associated
with the possibility of receiving a particular property back upon liquidation, which forms the basis of the Restricted Gain Method, is not satisfied at the property level, but at the aggregate level, no gain or loss is recognized on property sold by
the DIK-JV to a third party or received by the Company upon actual dissolution. Instead, the property received upon actual dissolution is recorded at the Company’s historical cost investment in the DIK-JV, reduced by the deferred gain.

Capitalization of Costs – We capitalize the acquisition of land, the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable
development costs incurred by recording them into properties in development in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and account for them in accordance with SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real
Estate Projects” (“Statement 67”) and EITF 97-11, “Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to Real Estate Property Acquisitions” (“EITF 97-11”). In summary, Statement 67 establishes that a rental project changes
from non-operating to operating when it is substantially completed and held available for occupancy. At that time, costs should no longer be capitalized. Other development costs include pre-development costs essential to the development of the
property, as well as, interest, real estate taxes, and direct employee



Index to Financial Statements

costs incurred during the development period. Pre-development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include
contract deposits, legal, engineering and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center. At December 31, 2008 we had $7.7 million of capitalized pre-development costs of which $3.0 million
represented refundable contract deposits. If we determine that the development of a specific project undergoing due diligence is no longer probable, we immediately expense all related capitalized pre-development costs not considered recoverable.
During 2008 and 2007, we expensed pre-development costs of $15.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively, recorded in other expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of the economic downturn primarily during the
month of December 2008, we evaluated our pre-development costs and determined that certain projects were no longer likely to be executed; therefore, we expensed those costs resulting in significantly higher expensed amounts in 2008 than in 2007. In
accordance with SFAS No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest Cost” (“Statement 34”), interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the
actual development costs expended. We cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on
the project beyond 12 months after substantial completion of the building shell. During 2008 we capitalized interest of $36.5 million on our development projects. We have a large staff of employees (the “Investment Group”) who support our
development program. All direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project. During 2008 and 2007, we capitalized $27.8 million and $39.0 million, respectively, of direct costs
incurred by the Investment Group. The capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring. As a result of the current economic downturn, development activity slowed during 2008 resulting in a reduction
in capitalized costs which increased general and administrative expenses. Also, if accounting standards issued in the future were to limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized we could incur a significant increase in our operating
expenses and a reduction in net income.

Real Estate Acquisitions - Upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, we estimate the
fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building and improvements), and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above- and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed debt in
accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“Statement 141”). Based on these estimates, we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We utilize methods similar to those
used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. We evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the
revised remaining useful life.

Valuation of Real Estate Investments – Our long-lived assets, primarily real estate held for
investment, are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is
warranted. The review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used to determine whether impairment exists and if so, to what extent. Depending on the asset, we use varying methods to determine fair value of the asset. If we determine that the
carrying amount of a property is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value, we will write down the asset to fair value. For properties to be “held and used” for long term investment we estimate undiscounted future cash flows over the
expected investment term including the estimated future value of the asset upon sale at the end of the investment period. Future value is generally determined by applying a market-based capitalization rate to the estimated future net operating
income in the final year of the expected investment term. If after applying this method a property is determined to be impaired, we determine the provision for impairment based upon applying a market capitalization rate to current estimated net
operating income as if the sale were to occur immediately. For properties “held for sale”, we estimate current resale values by market through appraisal information and other market data less expected costs to sell. In accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock” (“APB 18”), a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary
decline, must be recognized. In the case of our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, we calculate the present value of our



Index to Financial Statements

investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected term of investment. These methods of determining fair value can fluctuate
significantly as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate, tenant credit quality, and demand for new retail stores. The significant economic downturn that began during the fourth
quarter of 2008 and the corresponding rise in capitalization rates caused us to evaluate our properties for impairment including our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. As a result of our analysis, we recorded an additional $33.1
million provision for impairment during the three months ended December 31, 2008 in addition to the $1.8 million recorded through September 30, 2008. In summary, during the year we recorded $20.6 million related to eight shopping centers,
$7.2 million related to several land parcels, $6.0 million related to our investment in two partnerships, and $1.1 million related to a note receivable. If capitalization rates continue to rise in the future, or if a property categorized as
“held and used” were changed to “held for sale”, we could record additional impairments in subsequent periods.

Discontinued Operations – The application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held-for-sale on the balance sheet, or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the
sale of these properties as discontinued, requires management to make certain significant judgments. In evaluating whether a property meets the criteria set forth by SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets” (“Statement 144”), we make a determination as to the point in time whether it is probable that a sale will be consummated. Given the nature of real estate sales contracts, it is not unusual for such contracts to allow
potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract. In addition, certain other matters critical to the final sale, such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance.
As a result, properties under contract may not close within the expected time period, or may not close at all. Therefore, any properties categorized as held-for-sale represent only those properties that management has determined are probable to
close within the requirements set forth in Statement 144. In order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued operations, prior to the sale, we evaluate the extent of involvement and significance
of cash flows the sale will have with a property after the sale. Consistent with Statement 144, any property sold in which we have significant continuing involvement or cash flows (most often sales to co-investment partnerships in which we continue
to manage the property) is not considered to be discontinued. In addition, any property which we sell to an unrelated third party, but which we retain a property management function, is not considered discontinued. Therefore, based on our evaluation
of Statement 144 and in accordance with EITF 03-13 “Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement No. 144 in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations” (“EITF 03-13”), only properties sold, or to be
sold, to unrelated third parties, where we will have no significant continuing involvement or significant cash flows are classified as discontinued. In accordance with EITF 87-24 “Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations”
(“EITF 87-24”), its operations, including any mortgage interest and gain on sale, are reported in discontinued operations so that the operations are clearly distinguished. Prior periods are also reclassified to reflect the operations of
these properties as discontinued operations. When we sell operating properties to our joint ventures or to third parties, and will have continuing involvement, the operations and gains on sales are included in income from continuing operations.

Investments in Real Estate Partnerships – In addition to owning real estate directly, we invest in real estate through our
co-investment partnerships. Joint venturing provides us with a capital source to acquire real estate, and to earn our pro-rata share of the net income or loss from the co-investment partnerships in addition to fees for services. As asset and
property manager, we conduct the business of the Unconsolidated Properties held in the co-investment partnerships in the same way that we conduct the business of the Consolidated Properties that are wholly-owned; therefore, the Critical Accounting
Policies as described are also applicable to our investments in the co-investment partnerships. We account for all investments in which we do not have a controlling financial ownership interest using the equity method. We have determined that these
investments are not variable interest entities as defined in FIN 46(R) and do not require consolidation under EITF 04-5 or SOP 78-9, and therefore, are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting. Decisions, including
property acquisitions and dispositions, financings, certain leasing arrangements, annual budgets and dissolution of the ventures are subject to the approval of all partners, or in the case of the Fund, its advisory committee.

Income Tax Status - The prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that we will
continue to operate in order to qualify as a REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). We are required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that we continue to qualify as a REIT. As a
REIT, we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders. We evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our REIT status. Determining our taxable income, calculating
distributions, and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the Code. Because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal
and state income tax laws and regulations, our positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities, however, we reassess such positions at each reporting period.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2008, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 142-3 “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142-3”). This FSP amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used
to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under Statement 142. The intent of this FSP is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under Statement 142 and the period of expected cash
flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under FASB Statement No. 141R, and other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. The impact of adopting this statement is not considered to be material.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161 “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“Statement 161”). This Statement amends Statement 133 and changes the disclosure
requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This Statement is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. This Statement encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial
adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement although the impact is not considered to be material as only further disclosure is required.

In February 2008, the FASB amended Statement 157 with FSP FAS 157-2 “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (FSP FAS 157-2) to delay the effective date of Statement 157 for nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities to be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We do not believe the adoption of FSP FAS 157-2 for our nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have a material impact
on our financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements” (“Statement 160”). This Statement, among other things, establishes accounting and reporting standards for a parent company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary (previously referred to as a minority interest). This
Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 with early adoption prohibited. Once adopted, we will report minority interest as a component of equity in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R) “Business Combinations” (“Statement 141(R)”). This
Statement, among other things, establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree. This Statement also establishes disclosure requirements of the acquirer to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the effect of the business combination. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and early adoption is prohibited. The impact on our financial



Index to Financial Statements

statements and the financial statements of our co-investment partnerships will be reflected at the time of any acquisition after the implementation date that
meets the requirements above.

Results from Operations – 2008 vs. 2007

Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2008 to 2007:

At December 31, 2008, on a Combined
Basis, we were operating or developing 440 shopping centers, as compared to 451 shopping centers at December 31, 2007. We identify our shopping centers as either properties in development or operating properties. Properties in development are
defined as properties that are in the construction or initial lease-up process and have not reached their initial full occupancy (reaching full occupancy generally means achieving at least 95% leased and rent paying on newly constructed or renovated
GLA). At December 31, 2008, on a Combined Basis, we were developing 45 properties, as compared to 49 properties at December 31, 2007.

Our revenues increased by $56.8 million, or 13.0% to $493.4 million in 2008 as summarized in the following table (in thousands):

The increase in revenues was primarily related to higher minimum rent from (i) growth in
rental rates from the renewal of expiring leases or re-leasing vacant space in the operating properties, (ii) minimum rent generated from shopping center acquisitions in 2007, and (iii) recently completed shopping center developments
commencing operations in the current year. In addition to collecting minimum rent from our tenants, we also collect percentage rent based upon their sales volumes. Recoveries from tenants represent reimbursements from tenants for their pro-rata
share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers. Recoveries increased as a result of an increase in our operating expenses.

We earn fees, at market-based rates, for asset management, property management, leasing, acquisition, and financing services that we provide to our
co-investment partnerships and third parties summarized as follows (in thousands):

The increase in management, acquisition, and other fees is primarily related to the recognition of
a $19.7 million Portfolio Incentive Return fee in December 2008. The fee was earned by the Company based upon Columbia outperforming the NCREIF index since the inception of the partnership and a cumulative hurdle rate outlined in the partnership
agreement. Asset and property management fees increased during 2008 as a result of providing those management services to MCWR-DESCO, a joint venture formed in 2007.

Our operating expenses increased by $29.2 million, or 11.8%, to $277.1 million in 2008 related to increased operating and maintenance costs and depreciation expense as further described below. The



Index to Financial Statements

following table summarizes our operating expenses (in thousands):

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to acquisitions in 2007
and recently completed developments commencing operations in the current year. The increase in operating, maintenance, and real estate taxes was primarily due to acquisitions in 2007, recently completed developments commencing operations in the
current year, and to general increases in expenses incurred by the operating properties. On average, approximately 79% of these costs are recovered from our tenants through recoveries included in our revenues. General and administrative expense
declined as a result of reducing incentive compensation directly tied to performance targets associated with reductions in new development and reduced earnings metrics, both of which have been directly impacted by the current economic downturn.
During 2008, we also recorded restructuring charges of $2.4 million for employee severance and benefits related to employee reductions across various functional areas in general and administrative expense. The increase in other expenses is related
to expensing more pre-development costs in 2008 than in 2007 directly related to a slowing development program in the current economic environment.

The following table presents the change in interest expense from 2008 to 2007 (in thousands):

Interest on Unsecured credit facilities increased during 2008 by $2.5 million due to the increase
in the outstanding balance under the Unsecured credit facilities. Interest expense on notes payable increased during 2008 by $10.6 million due to higher outstanding debt balances including the issuance of $400.0 million of unsecured debt in
September 2007, the acquisition of shopping centers in 2007, and the mortgage debt placed on a consolidated joint venture in 2008. The higher development project costs also resulted in an increase in capitalized interest.

Gains on sale of real estate included in continuing operations were $20.3 million in 2008 as compared to $52.2 million in 2007. Included in 2008 gains
are a $5.3 million gain from the sale of 12 out-parcels for net proceeds of $38.2 million, a $1.2 million gain recognized on two out-parcels originally deferred at the time of sale, and a $13.8 million gain (net of the greater of our ownership
interest or the gain deferral under the Restricted Gain Method described in our Critical Accounting Policies) from the sale of four properties in development to joint ventures for net proceeds of $110.5 million. Included in 2007 gains are a $7.2
million gain from the sale of 27 out-parcels for net proceeds of $55.9 million, a $40.9 million gain from the sale of five properties in development to the Fund for net proceeds of $102.8 million, a $2.2 million gain related to the partial sale of
our interest in the Fund, and a $1.9 million gain from our share of a contractual earn out payment related to a property previously sold to a joint venture. There were no property sales to DIK-JV’s in 2007.

During 2008, we established a provision for impairment of approximately $34.9 million as described above in our Critical Accounting Policies under
Valuations of Real Estate. Included in the



Index to Financial Statements

provision is $27.8 million for estimated impairment losses on eight operating properties, one large parcel of land held for future development, along with
several smaller land out-parcels; $6.0 million on two of our investments in real estate partnerships; and $1.1 million related to a note receivable.

Our equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships decreased $12.8 million during 2008 as follows (in thousands):

The decrease in our equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships is
primarily related to higher gains recorded in 2007 from the sale of shopping centers sold by MCWR I, as well as, the sale of a shopping center owned by a joint venture classified above in other investments in real estate partnerships.

Income from discontinued operations was $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 related to the sale of seven properties in development
and three operating properties sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of $86.2 million, including the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as held-for-sale in 2008. Income from discontinued operations was $33.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2007 related to the sale of four properties in development and three operating properties to unrelated parties for net proceeds of $112.3 million and including the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as
held-for-sale in 2008 and 2007. In compliance with Statement 144, if we sell a property or classify a property as held-for-sale, we are required to reclassify its operations into discontinued operations for all prior periods which results in a
reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations. Our income from discontinued operations is shown net of minority interest of exchangeable operating partnership units of approximately $180,000
and $268,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively and income taxes of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Net income for common stockholders for the year ended decreased $67.5 million to $116.5 million in 2008 as compared with $184.0 million in 2007 primarily related to lower gains recognized from the sale of real estate
and the provision for impairment recorded in 2008 as discussed previously. Diluted earnings per share was $1.66 in 2008 as compared to $2.65 in 2007 or 37.4% lower.

Results from Operations – 2007 vs. 2006

Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2007 to 2006:

Our revenues increased by $32.5 million, or 8.1% to $436.6 million in 2007 as summarized in the following table (in thousands):



Index to Financial Statements

The increase in revenues was primarily related to higher minimum rent from (i) growth in
rental rates from the renewal of expiring leases or re-leasing vacant space in the operating properties, (ii) minimum rent generated from shopping center acquisitions, and (iii) recently completed shopping center developments commencing
operations in the current year. In addition to collecting minimum rent from our tenants, we also collect percentage rent based upon their sales volumes. Recoveries increased as a result of an increase in our operating expenses

We earn fees, at market-based rates, for asset management, property management, leasing, acquisition and financing services that we provide to our
co-investment partnerships and third parties summarized as follows (in thousands):

Asset management fees were higher in 2007 because the agreement to provide asset management
services to MCWR II did not commence until December 2006; and the closing and related commencement of the agreements with the Fund did not occur until December 2006. Property management fees increased in 2007 as a result of providing property
management services to MCWR-DESCO and the Fund. Acquisition and financing fees earned in 2007 include a $3.2 million acquisition fee from MCWR-DESCO related to the acquisition of 32 retail centers described above. Acquisition and financing fees
earned in 2006 include fees earned as part of the acquisition of the First Washington portfolio by MCWR II.

Our operating expenses
increased by $16.0 million, or 6.9%, to $247.8 million in 2007 related to increased operating and maintenance costs, general and administrative costs, and depreciation expense, as further described below. The following table summarizes our operating
expenses (in thousands):

The increase in operating, maintenance, and real estate taxes was primarily due to acquisitions
and completed developments commencing operations in 2007, and to general increases in expenses incurred by the operating properties. On average, approximately 79% of these costs are recovered from our tenants through recoveries included in our
revenues. The increase in general and administrative expense was related to annual salary increases and higher costs associated with incentive compensation, in addition to, increased staffing and recruiting costs to manage the growth in our shopping
center development program. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was



Index to Financial Statements

primarily related to acquisitions and recently completed developments commencing operations in 2007, net of properties sold. The decrease in other expenses
was related to lower income tax expense incurred by Regency Realty Group, Inc. (“RRG”), our taxable REIT subsidiary. RRG is subject to federal and state income taxes and files separate tax returns.

The following table presents the change in interest expense from 2007 to 2006 (in thousands):

Interest expense on the Unsecured credit facilities and notes payable increased during 2007 by
$13.4 million due to higher outstanding debt balances including the issuance of $400.0 million of unsecured debt in June 2007, increased development activity and the acquisition of shopping centers. The higher development project costs also resulted
in an increase in capitalized interest.

Gains from the sale of real estate included in continuing operations were $52.2 million in 2007 as
compared to $65.6 million in 2006. Included in 2007 gains are a $7.2 million gain from the sale of 27 out-parcels for net proceeds of $55.9 million, a $40.9 million gain from the sale of five properties in development to the Fund for net proceeds of
$102.8 million, a $2.2 million gain related to the partial sale of our ownership interest in the Fund, and a $1.9 million gain from our share of a contractual earn out payment related to a property previously sold to a joint venture. Included in
2006 gains are a $20.2 million gain from the sale of 30 out-parcels for net proceeds of $53.5 million, a $35.9 million gain from the sale of six shopping centers to co-investment partnerships for net proceeds of $122.7 million; as well as a $9.5
million gain related to the partial sale of our ownership interest in MCWR II. There were no sales to DIK-JV’s in 2007 or 2006.

Our
equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships increased approximately $15.5 million during 2007 as follows (in thousands):

The increase in our equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships is
primarily related to growth in rental income generally realized in all of the joint venture portfolios and higher gains from the sale of shopping centers sold by MCWR I, as well as, the sale of a shopping center owned by a joint venture classified
above in Other investments.

Income from discontinued operations was $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to the
sale of four development properties and three operating properties to unrelated parties for



Index to Financial Statements

net proceeds of $112.3 million, and including the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as held-for-sale in 2008 and 2007. Income from
discontinued operations was $68.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the sale of three development properties and eight operating properties to unrelated parties for net proceeds of $149.6 million, and including the
operations of shopping centers sold or classified as held-for-sale in 2008, 2007, and 2006. In compliance with Statement 144, if we sell an asset in the current year, we are required to reclassify its operations into discontinued operations for all
prior periods. This practice results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations. Our income from discontinued operations is shown net of minority interest of exchangeable operating
partnership units totaling approximately $268,000 and $896,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and income taxes totaling $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Net income for common stockholders decreased $14.8 million to $184.0 million in 2007 as compared with $198.8 million in 2006 primarily related to lower
gains recognized from the sale of 15 properties as compared to 22 in 2006. Diluted earnings per share was $2.65 in 2007 as compared to $2.89 in 2006 or 8.3% lower.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers
pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks. We believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in
accordance with current laws and regulations. Generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to non-chlorinated solvent systems. Where available, we have applied and been
accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs. We have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination.
We have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk. We monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases
voluntarily remediate the sites. We also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so. We estimate the cost associated with these legal obligations to be approximately $3.2 million, all of which has been
reserved. We believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or operations; however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies
with respect to our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of
the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in
additional environmental liability to us.

Inflation

Inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, more recent data suggests inflation has been increasing and may become a greater concern
in the current economy. Substantially all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants’ gross sales,
which generally increase as prices rise; and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation
indices. In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. Most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses, including
common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market Risk

We are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk. Our Line has a variable interest rate that
is based upon LIBOR plus a spread of 40 basis points and the term loan within our Term Facility has a variable interest rate based upon LIBOR plus a spread of 105 basis points. LIBOR rates charged on our Unsecured credit facilities change monthly.
Based upon the current balance of our Unsecured credit facilities, a 1% increase in LIBOR would equate to an additional $3.0 million of interest costs per year. The spread on the Unsecured credit facilities is dependent upon maintaining specific
credit ratings. If our credit ratings were downgraded, the spread on the Unsecured credit facilities would increase, resulting in higher interest costs. We are also exposed to higher interest rates when we refinance our existing long-term fixed rate
debt. The objective of our interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates
and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for
speculative purposes.

We have $428.3 million of fixed rate debt maturing in 2010 and 2011 that have a weighted average fixed interest rate
of 8.07%, which includes $400.0 million of unsecured long-term debt. During 2006 we entered into four forward-starting interest rate swaps (the “Swaps”) totaling $396.7 million with fixed rates of 5.399%, 5.415%, 5.399%, and
5.415%. We designated these Swaps as cash flow hedges to fix the future interest rates on $400.0 million of the financing expected to occur in 2010 and 2011. As a result of a decline in 10 year Treasury interest rates since
the inception of the Swaps, the fair value of the Swaps as of December 31, 2008 is reflected as a liability of $83.7 million in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet. It remains highly probable that the
forecasted transactions will occur as projected at the inception of the Swaps and therefore, the change in fair value of the Swaps is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. To the extent that future 10-year Treasury rates (at the future settlement dates) are higher than current rates, this liability will decline. If a liability exists at the dates the Swaps are settled, the liability will be
amortized over the term of the respective debt issuances as additional interest expense in addition to the stated interest rates on the new issuances. In the case of $196.7 million of the Swaps, we continue to expect to issue new secured
or unsecured debt for a term of 7 to 12 years during the period between June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2010. In the case of $200.0 million of the Swaps, we continue to expect to issue new debt for a term of 7 to 12 years during the
period between March 30, 2010 and March 30, 2011. We continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments. Based upon the current capital markets, our
current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings, we expect that we will successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund our obligations. However, in the
current environment, we expect interest rates on new issuances to be significantly higher than on historical issuances. An increase of 1.0% in the interest rate of new debt issues above that of maturing debt would result in additional
annual interest expense of $4.3 million in addition to the impact of the annual amortization that would be incurred as a result of settling the Swaps.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal cash flows (in thousands), weighted average interest rates of remaining debt, and the fair value of total debt
(in thousands) as of December 31, 2008, by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes. Although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table, those rates
represent rates that existed at December 31, 2008 and are subject to change on a monthly basis.

The table incorporates only those
exposures that exist as of December 31, 2008 and does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. Since firm commitments are not presented, the table has limited predictive value. As a result, our ultimate
realized gain or loss with



Index to Financial Statements

respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time, and actual interest
rates.

(a)

Average interest rates at the end of each year presented.

The fair value of total debt in the table above is $1.3 billion versus the face value of $2.1 billion, which suggests that as new debt is issued in the
future to repay maturing debt, the cost of new debt issuances will be higher than the current cost of existing debt.

Regency Centers Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regency Centers Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. In connection with our audits of the consolidated
financial statements, we also have audited financial statement Schedule III. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Regency Centers Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

Regency Centers Corporation:

We have audited Regency Centers Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Regency Centers Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Regency Centers Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Regency Centers Corporation as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Organization and Principles of Consolidation

General

Regency Centers Corporation (“Regency” or the “Company”) began its operations as a Real Estate
Investment Trust (“REIT”) in 1993 and is the managing general partner of its operating partnership, Regency Centers, L.P. (“RCLP” or the “Partnership”). Regency currently owns approximately 99% of the outstanding common
partnership units (“Units”) of the Partnership. Regency engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, and development of retail shopping centers through the Partnership, and has no other assets or liabilities other than
through its investment in the Partnership. At December 31, 2008, the Partnership directly owned 224 retail shopping centers and held partial interests in an additional 216 retail shopping centers through investments in real estate partnerships
(also referred to as co-investment partnerships or joint ventures).

Estimates, Risks, and Uncertainties

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires Regency’s management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the carrying values of its investments in real estate including its shopping centers, properties in
development and its unconsolidated investments in real estate partnerships, tenant receivables, net, and derivative instruments. Each of these items could be significantly affected by the current economic recession.

Because of the adverse conditions that exist in the real estate markets, as well as, the credit and financial markets, it is possible that the estimates
and assumptions that have been utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements could change significantly. Specifically as it relates to the Company’s business, the current economic recession is expected to result in a
higher level of retail store closings nationally, which could reduce the demand for leasing space in the Company’s shopping centers and result in a decline in occupancy and rental revenues in its real estate portfolio. The lack of available
credit in the commercial real estate market is causing a decline in the values of commercial real estate nationally and the Company’s ability to sell shopping centers to raise capital. A reduction in the demand for new retail space and capital
availability have caused the Company to significantly reduce its new shopping center development program until markets become less volatile.

Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Partnership, its
wholly owned subsidiaries, and joint ventures in which the Partnership has a controlling ownership interest. The equity interests of third parties held in the Partnership or its controlled joint ventures are included under the heading Minority
Interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as preferred units, exchangeable operating partnership



Index to Financial Statements

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2008

units, or limited partners’ interest in consolidated partnerships. All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in the
consolidated financial statements.

Investments in real estate partnerships not controlled by the Company are accounted for under the equity
method. The Company has evaluated its investment in the real estate partnerships and has concluded that they are not variable interest entities as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R)
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46(R)”). Further, the venture partners in the real estate partnerships have significant ownership rights, including approval over operating budgets and strategic plans, capital
spending, sale or financing, and admission of new partners. Upon formation of the investment in real estate partnership, the Company also became the managing member, responsible for the day-to-day operations of the partnership. The Company evaluated
its investment in the partnership and concluded that the partner has substantive participating rights and, therefore, the Company has concluded that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for these investments and they do not require
consolidation under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5 “Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights”
(“EITF 04-5”), or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) Statement of Position 78-9, “Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures” (“SOP 78-9”). Under the equity method
of accounting, investments in the real estate partnerships are initially recorded at cost, subsequently increased for additional contributions and allocations of income, and reduced for distributions received and allocations of loss. These
investments are included in the consolidated financial statements as investments in real estate partnerships.

Ownership of the
Company

Regency has a single class of common stock outstanding and three series of preferred stock outstanding (“Series 3, 4, and
5 Preferred Stock”). The dividends on the Series 3, 4, and 5 Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter. The Company owns corresponding Series 3, 4, and 5 preferred unit interests
(“Series 3, 4, and 5 Preferred Units”) in the Partnership that entitle the Company to income and distributions from the Partnership in amounts equal to the dividends paid on the Company’s Series 3, 4, and 5 Preferred Stock.

Ownership of the Operating Partnership

The Partnership’s capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units, Series 3, 4, and 5 Preferred Units owned by the Company, and Series D Preferred Units owned by institutional investors.

At December 31, 2008, the Company owned approximately 99% or 70,036,670 Partnership Units of the total 70,504,881 Partnership Units outstanding.
Each outstanding common Partnership Unit not owned by the Company is exchangeable for one share of Regency common stock or can be redeemed for cash, at the Company’s discretion (see Note 1(l)). The Company revalues the minority interest
associated with the Partnership Units each quarter to maintain a proportional relationship between the book value of equity associated with common stockholders relative to that of the Partnership Unit holders since both have equivalent rights and
the Partnership Units are convertible into shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.



Index to Financial Statements

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2008

Net income and distributions of the Partnership are allocable first to the Preferred Units, and the
remaining amounts to the general and limited Partnership Units in accordance with their ownership percentage. The Series 3, 4, and 5 Preferred Units owned by the Company are eliminated in consolidation.

(b)

Revenues

The Company leases space to tenants under
agreements with varying terms. Leases are accounted for as operating leases with minimum rent recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease regardless of when payments are due. Accrued rents are included in tenant receivables. The
Company estimates the collectibility of the accounts receivable related to base rents, straight-line rents, expense reimbursements, and other revenue taking into consideration the Company’s experience in the retail sector, available internal
and external tenant credit information, payment history, industry trends, tenant credit-worthiness, and remaining lease terms. In some cases, primarily relating to straight-line rents, the collection of these amounts extends beyond one year.
Substantially all of the lease agreements with anchor tenants contain provisions that provide for additional rents based on tenants’ sales volume (percentage rent) and reimbursement of the tenants’ share of real estate taxes, insurance,
and common area maintenance (“CAM”) costs. Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements. Recovery of real estate taxes, insurance, and CAM costs are recognized as the
respective costs are incurred in accordance with the lease agreements.

As part of the leasing process, the Company may provide the lessee
with an allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements. These leasehold improvements are capitalized and recorded as tenant improvements, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term. If the
allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event the Company is not considered the owner of the improvements, the allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease
term as a reduction of rental revenue. Factors considered during this evaluation include, among other things, who holds legal title to the improvements as well as other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement and provisions for
substantiation of such costs (e.g. unilateral control of the tenant space during the build-out process). Determination of the appropriate accounting for the payment of a tenant allowance is made on a lease-by-lease basis, considering the facts and
circumstances of the individual tenant lease. Recognition of lease revenue commences when the lessee is given possession of the leased space upon completion of tenant improvements when the Company is the owner of the leasehold improvements. However,
when the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant, the lease inception date is the date the tenant obtains possession of the leased space for purposes of constructing its leasehold improvements.

The Company accounts for profit recognition on sales of real estate in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate” (“Statement 66”). In summary, profits from sales of real estate are not recognized under the full accrual method by the Company unless a sale is consummated; the buyer’s
initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property; the Company’s receivable, if applicable, is not subject to future subordination; the Company has transferred to the buyer the usual risks and
rewards of ownership; and the Company does not have substantial continuing involvement with the property.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2008

The Company sells shopping center properties to joint ventures in exchange for cash equal to the fair
value of the percentage interest owned by its partners. The Company accounts for those sales as “partial sales” and recognizes gains on those partial sales in the period the properties were sold to the extent of the percentage interest
sold under the guidance of Statement 66, and in the case of certain partnerships, applies a more restrictive method of recognizing gains, as discussed further below. The gains and operations are not recorded as discontinued operations because the
Company continues to manage these shopping centers.

Five of the Company’s joint ventures (“DIK-JV”) give either partner the
unilateral right to elect to dissolve the partnership and, upon such an election, receive a distribution in-kind (“DIK”) of the assets of the partnership equal to their respective ownership interests, which could include properties the
Company sold to the partnership. The liquidation procedures would require that all of the properties owned by the partnership be appraised to determine their respective and collective fair values. As a general rule, if the Company initiates the
liquidation process, its partner has the right to choose the first property that it will receive in liquidation with the Company having the right to choose the next property that it will receive in liquidation. If the Company’s partner
initiates the liquidation process, the order of the selection process is reversed. The process then continues with alternating selection of properties by each partner until the balance of each partner’s capital account on a fair value basis has
been distributed. After the final selection, to the extent that the fair value of properties in the DIK-JV are not distributable in a manner that equals the balance of each partner’s capital account, a cash payment would be made by the partner
receiving a fair value in excess of its capital account to the other partner. The partners may also elect to liquidate some or all of the properties through sales rather than through the DIK process.

The Company has concluded that these DIK dissolution provisions constitute in-substance call/put options under the guidance of Statement 66, and represent
a form of continuing involvement with respect to property that the Company has sold to these partnerships, limiting the Company’s recognition of gain related to the partial sale. To the extent that the DIK-JV owns more than one property and the
Company is unable to obtain all of the properties it sold to the DIK-JV in liquidation, the Company applies a more restrictive method of gain recognition (“Restricted Gain Method”) which considers the Company’s potential ability to
receive property through a DIK on which partial gain has been recognized, and ensures, as discussed below, maximum gain deferral upon sale to a DIK-JV. The Company has applied the Restricted Gain Method to partial sales of property to partnerships
that contain unilateral DIK provisions.

Under current guidance, (Statement 66, paragraph 25), profit shall be recognized by a method
determined by the nature and extent of the seller’s continuing involvement and the profit recognized shall be reduced by the maximum exposure to loss. The Company has concluded that the Restricted Gain Method accomplishes this objective.

Under the Restricted Gain Method, for purposes of gain deferral, the Company considers the aggregate pool of properties sold into the
DIK-JV as well as the aggregate pool of properties which will be distributed in the DIK process. As a result, upon the sale of properties to a DIK-JV, the Company performs a hypothetical DIK liquidation assuming that it would choose only those
properties that it has sold to the DIK-JV in an amount equivalent to its capital account. For purposes of calculating the gain to be deferred, the Company assumes that it will select properties upon a DIK liquidation that generated the highest gain
to the Company

when originally sold to the DIK-JV. The DIK deferred gain is calculated whenever a property is sold to the DIK-JV by the Company. During the years when there
are no property sales, the DIK deferred gain is not recalculated.

Because the contingency associated with the possibility of receiving a
particular property back upon liquidation, which forms the basis of the Restricted Gain Method, is not satisfied at the property level, but at the aggregate level, no gain or loss is recognized on property sold by the DIK-JV to a third party or
received by the Company upon actual dissolution. Instead, the property received upon actual dissolution is recorded at the Company’s historical cost investment in the DIK-JV, reduced by the deferred gain.

The Company has been engaged under agreements with its joint venture partners to provide asset management, property management, leasing, investing, and
financing services for such ventures’ shopping centers. The fees are market-based, generally calculated as a percentage of either revenues earned or the estimated values of the properties managed, and are recognized as services are rendered,
when fees due are determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.

(c)

Real Estate Investments

Land, buildings, and improvements
are recorded at cost. All specifically identifiable costs related to development activities are capitalized into properties in development on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Properties in development are defined as properties that are
in the construction or initial lease-up process and have not reached their initial full occupancy (reaching full occupancy generally means achieving at least 95% leased and rent paying on newly constructed or renovated GLA) and are accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects” (“Statement 67”). In summary, Statement 67 establishes that a rental project changes from non-operating to operating
when it is substantially completed and available for occupancy. At that time, costs should no longer be capitalized. The capitalized costs include pre-development costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction
costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, and allocated direct employee costs incurred during the period of development. In accordance with SFAS No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest Cost” (“Statement 34”), interest costs are
capitalized into each development project based on applying the Company’s weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended. The Company ceases interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer
being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would the Company capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after substantial completion of the building shell.

The Company incurs costs prior to land acquisition including contract deposits, as well as legal, engineering, and other external professional fees
related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center. These pre-development costs are included in properties in development in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, and 2007, the Company had
capitalized pre-development costs of $7.7 million and $22.7 million, respectively, of which approximately $3.0 million and $10.8 million, respectively, were refundable deposits. If the Company determines that the development of a particular shopping
center is no longer probable, any related pre-development costs previously capitalized are immediately expensed in other expenses in the accompanying Consolidated

Statements of Operations. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company expensed pre-development costs of $15.5 million, $5.3 million, and $2.4 million,
respectively, in other expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or
extend the useful lives of the respective assets are recorded in operating and maintenance expense.

Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, the shorter of the useful life or the lease term for tenant improvements, and three to seven years for furniture and equipment.

The Company and the real estate partnerships allocate the purchase price of assets acquired (net tangible and identifiable intangible assets) and
liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values at the date of acquisition pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“Statement 141”). Statement 141 provides guidance on the allocation of a
portion of the purchase price of a property to intangible assets. The Company’s methodology for this allocation includes estimating an “as-if vacant” fair value of the physical property, which is allocated to land, building, and
improvements. The difference between the purchase price and the “as-if vacant” fair value is allocated to intangible assets. There are three categories of intangible assets to be considered: (i) value of in-place leases,
(ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases, and (iii) customer relationship value.

The value of in-place leases is
estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period. The value of
in-place leases is recorded to amortization expense over the remaining initial term of the respective leases in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“Statement 142”).

Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the
contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The
value of above-market leases is amortized as a reduction of minimum rent over the remaining terms of the respective leases as required by Statement 142. The value of below-market leases is accreted as an increase to minimum rent over the remaining
terms of the respective leases, including below-market renewal options, if applicable, as required by Statement 142. The Company does not allocate value to customer relationship intangibles if it has pre-existing business relationships with the
major retailers in the acquired property since they do not provide incremental value over the Company’s existing relationships.

The Company and its investments in real estate partnerships follow the provisions of SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“Statement 144”). In accordance with Statement 144, the Company classifies an operating property or a property in development as held-for-sale when
the Company determines that the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, the property is being actively marketed for sale, and management believes it is probable that a sale will be consummated within one year. Given the
nature of all real estate sales contracts, it is not unusual for such contracts to allow prospective buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract. In addition, certain other matters critical to the
final sale, such as financing arrangements, often remain pending even upon contract acceptance. As a result, properties under contract may not close within the expected time period, or may not close at all. Therefore, any properties categorized as
held-for-sale represent only those properties that management has determined are probable to close within the requirements set forth in Statement 144. Operating properties held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to
sell. The recording of depreciation and amortization expense is suspended during the held-for-sale period.

In accordance with Statement 144
and EITF 03-13 “Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement 144 in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations” (“EITF 03-13”), when the Company sells a property or classifies a property as held-for-sale
and will not have significant continuing involvement in the operation of the property, the operations of the property are eliminated from ongoing operations and classified in discontinued operations. In accordance with EITF 87-24 “Allocation of
Interest to Discontinued Operations” (“EITF 87-24”), its operations, including any mortgage interest and gain on sale, are reported in discontinued operations so that the operations are clearly distinguished. Prior periods are also
reclassified to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations. When the Company sells operating properties to its joint ventures or to third parties, and will continue to manage the properties, the operations and gains on
sales are included in income from continuing operations.

The Company reviews its real estate portfolio including the properties owned
through investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For properties to be “held and used” for long term investment, the Company
estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the expected investment term including the estimated future value of the asset upon sale at the end of the investment period. Future value is generally determined by applying a market based
capitalization rate to the estimated future net operating income in the final year of the expected investment term. If after applying this method a property is determined to be impaired, the Company determines the provision for impairment based upon
applying a market capitalization rate to current estimated net operating income as if the sale were to occur immediately. For properties “held for sale”, the Company estimates current resale values by market through appraisal information
and other market data less expected costs to sell. These methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the general economy of those markets in which the Company operates,
tenant credit quality, and demand for new retail stores. The significant economic downturn that began during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the corresponding rise in market capitalization rates caused the Company to evaluate its real estate
investments for impairment. As a result, the Company recorded an additional $33.1 million provision for impairment during the three months ended December 31, 2008 in addition to the $1.8 million recorded through September 30, 2008. In
summary, during 2008



Index to Financial Statements

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2008

the Company recorded $20.6 million related to eight shopping centers, $7.2 million related to several land parcels, and $1.1 million related to a note
receivable. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock” (“APB 18”), a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting,
which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. To evaluate the Company’s investment in real estate partnerships, the Company calculates the fair value of the investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected
term of the investment. As a result, during 2008 the Company established a $6.0 million provision for impairment on two investments in real estate partnerships. During 2006, the Company established a provision for impairment of $500,000 and the
amount is now included in discontinued operations.

(d)

Income Taxes

The Company believes it qualifies, and
intends to continue to qualify, as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). As a REIT, the Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders are at least equal to REIT
taxable income.

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Earnings and profits, which
determine the taxability of dividends to stockholders, differs from net income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily because of differences in depreciable lives and cost bases of the shopping centers, as well as other timing
differences. See Note 8 for further discussion.

(e)

Deferred Costs

Deferred costs include leasing costs and
loan costs, net of accumulated amortization. Such costs are amortized over the periods through lease expiration or loan maturity, respectively. If the lease is terminated early or if the loan is repaid prior to maturity, the remaining leasing costs
or loan costs are written off. Deferred leasing costs consist of internal and external commissions associated with leasing the Company’s shopping centers. Net deferred leasing costs were $46.8 million and $41.2 million at December 31, 2008
and 2007, respectively. Deferred loan costs consist of initial direct and incremental costs associated with financing activities. Net deferred loan costs were $10.7 million and $11.6 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

(f)

Earnings per Share and Treasury Stock

The Company
calculates earnings per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share” (“Statement 128”). Basic earnings per share of common stock is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the conversion of obligations and the assumed exercises of securities including the effects of shares issuable under the Company’s share-based

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

payment arrangements, if dilutive. See Note 14 for the calculation of earnings per share (“EPS”).

Repurchases of the Company’s common stock are recorded at cost and are reflected as treasury stock in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Regency’s outstanding shares do not include treasury shares.

(g)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Any instruments which have an
original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $8.7 million and $8.0 million, respectively of cash was restricted through escrow agreements required for a development and
certain mortgage loans.

(h)

Notes Receivable

The Company records notes receivable at
cost on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and interest income is accrued as earned in interest expense, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. If a note receivable is past due, meaning the debtor is past due per
contractual obligations, the Company will no longer accrue interest income. However, in the event the debtor subsequently becomes current, the Company will resume accruing interest. The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and
principal for all notes receivable to determine whether impairment exists using the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the note receivable’s effective interest rate or in accordance with SFAS No. 114, “Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan—Income Recognition and Disclosures” (“Statement 114”) as amended by SFAS No. 118, “Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan—Income Recognition and Disclosures”
(“Statement 118”) which is based on observable market prices. In the event the Company determines a note receivable or a portion thereof is considered uncollectible, the Company records an allowance for credit loss. The Company estimates
the collectibility of notes receivable taking into consideration the Company’s experience in the retail sector, available internal and external credit information, payment history, market and industry trends, and debtor credit-worthiness. See
Note 6 for further discussion.

(i)

Stock-Based Compensation

Regency grants stock-based
compensation to its employees and directors. When Regency issues common shares as compensation, it receives a like number of common units from the Partnership. Regency is committed to contribute to the Partnership all proceeds from the exercise of
stock options or other share-based awards granted under Regency’s Long-Term Omnibus Plan (the “Plan”). Accordingly, Regency’s ownership in the Partnership will increase based on the amount of proceeds contributed to the
Partnership for the common units it receives. As a result of the issuance of common units to Regency for stock-based compensation, the Partnership accounts for stock-based compensation in the same manner as Regency.

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payment” (“Statement 123(R)”)
which requires companies to measure the cost of stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost

of the stock-based compensation is expensed over the vesting period. See Note 13 for further discussion.

(j)

Segment Reporting

The Company’s business is
investing in retail shopping centers through direct ownership or through joint ventures. The Company actively manages its portfolio of retail shopping centers and may from time to time make decisions to sell lower performing properties or
developments not meeting its long-term investment objectives. The proceeds from sales are reinvested into higher quality retail shopping centers through acquisitions or new developments, which management believes will meet its expected rate of
return. It is management’s intent that all retail shopping centers will be owned or developed for investment purposes; however, the Company may decide to sell all or a portion of a development upon completion. The Company’s revenue and net
income are generated from the operation of its investment portfolio. The Company also earns fees from third parties for services provided to manage and lease retail shopping centers owned through joint ventures.

The Company’s portfolio is located throughout the United States; however, management does not distinguish or group its operations on a geographical
basis for purposes of allocating resources or measuring performance. The Company reviews operating and financial data for each property on an individual basis; therefore, the Company defines an operating segment as its individual properties. No
individual property constitutes more than 10% of the Company’s combined revenue, net income or assets, and thus the individual properties have been aggregated into one reportable segment based upon their similarities with regard to both the
nature and economics of the centers, tenants and operational processes, as well as long-term average financial performance. In addition, no single tenant accounts for 6% or more of revenue and none of the shopping centers are located outside the
United States.

(k)

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for
all derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“Statement 133”) as amended by SFAS No. 149 “Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“Statement 149”). Statement 133 requires that all derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values. Gains
or losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The Company’s use of derivative financial instruments is to
mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or forecasted transaction through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.

Statement 133 requires that changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges be recognized in other comprehensive income
(“OCI”) while the ineffective portion of the derivative’s change in fair value be recognized in the income statement as interest expense. Upon the settlement of a hedge, gains and losses remaining in OCI are amortized over the
underlying term of the hedge transaction. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk



Index to Financial Statements

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing
basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows and/or forecasted cash flows of the hedged items.

In assessing the valuation of the hedges, the Company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option
pricing models, and termination costs at each balance sheet date. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. See Notes 10 and 11 for further discussion.

(l)

Redeemable Minority Interests

EITF Topic D-98
“Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities” (“EITF Topic D-98”) clarifies Rule 5-02.28 of Regulation S-X and requires securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent
equity if they are redeemable (i) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date; (ii) at the option of the holder; or (iii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer.
Minority interest in the operating partnership is classified as exchangeable operating partnership units (“OP Units”) in Regency’s accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The holders may redeem these OP Units for a like number of
shares of common stock of Regency or cash, at the Company’s discretion. See Note 11 for further discussion.

(m)

Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity

The Company accounts for minority interest in consolidated entities in accordance with SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity”
(“Statement 150”) which requires companies having consolidated entities with specified termination dates to treat minority owners’ interests in such entities as liabilities in an amount based on the fair value of the entities. See
Note 11 for further discussion.

(n)

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value

On
January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“Statement 157”) as amended by FASB Staff Position “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (“FSP FAS 157-2”).
Statement 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, Statement 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of
the hierarchy). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.



Index to Financial Statements

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2008

•

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

•

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the Company’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related
market activity.

In January 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities” (“Statement 159”). This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Although
Statement 159 was adopted, the Company did not elect to measure any other financial statement items at fair value. See Note 11 for all fair value measurements of assets and liabilities made on a recurring and nonrecurring basis.

(o)

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2008, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 142-3 “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142-3”). This FSP amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to
determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under Statement 142. The intent of this FSP is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under Statement 142 and the period of expected cash flows
used to measure the fair value of the asset under FASB Statement No. 141R, and other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. The impact of adopting this statement is not considered to be material.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161 “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“Statement 161”). This Statement amends Statement 133 and changes the disclosure requirements for
derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for
under Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This Statement is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. This Statement encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement although the impact is not considered to be material as only further disclosure is required.

In February 2008, the FASB amended Statement 157 with FSP FAS 157-2 “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (FSP FAS 157-2) to delay the effective date of Statement 157 for nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities to be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company does not believe the adoption of FSP FAS 157-2 for its nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have a
material impact on its financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 “Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements” (“Statement 160”). This Statement, among other things,



Index to Financial Statements

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2008

establishes accounting and reporting standards for a parent company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary (previously referred to as a minority
interest). This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 with early adoption prohibited. Once adopted, the Company will report minority interest as a component of equity in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R) “Business Combinations” (“Statement
141(R)”). This Statement, among other things, establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree. This Statement also establishes disclosure requirements of the acquirer to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the effect of the business combination. This Statement is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and early adoption is prohibited. The impact on the Company’s financial statements and its co-investment partnerships’ financial statements will be reflected at the time
of any acquisition after the implementation date that meets the requirements above.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been
made to the 2007 and 2006 amounts to conform to classifications adopted in 2008.

2.

Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements

As
described further in Note 1(b), certain of the Company’s co-investment partnership agreements contain unilateral DIK provisions. Such provisions constitute in-substance call/put options on properties sold to co-investment partnerships with
unilateral DIK provisions and are a form of continuing involvement under Statement 66. As a result, the Company has adopted and applied the Restricted Gain Method, which maximizes gain deferral on partial sales of real estate to DIK-JV’s. The
Company previously recognized gains from such sales to all co-investment partnerships to the extent of the percentage interest sold and deferred gains to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest in the co-investment partnerships.

The Company also previously recognized any remaining deferred gain as equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships when a
property was sold by a co-investment partnership to a third party. This policy will no longer be applied to any DIK-JV. Instead, the property received upon dissolution will be recorded at the Company’s investment in the DIK-JV, reduced by the
deferred gain. The Company sold properties to DIK-JV’s during 2008 and the years 2001 to 2005. The Company did not sell any properties to DIK-JV’s during 2007 or 2006.

The Company’s January 1, 2006 opening balance of distributions in excess of net income has been restated in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss) by $27.6 million related to additional gain deferrals on partial sales to DIK-JV’s of $27.1 million, net of tax and minority interest in exchangeable operating partnership
units, and the reversal of gains of approximately $511,000 associated with subsequent DIK-JV property sales to third parties to reflect the retrospective application of the Restricted Gain Method. The Company’s December 31, 2007
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet has been corrected to reflect the adjustments associated with the application of the Restricted Gain Method prior to 2006; accordingly, its investments in real estate partnerships has been decreased



Index to Financial Statements

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2008

by $31.0 million, its net deferred tax asset recorded in other assets has been increased by $2.8 million, its minority interest in exchangeable partnership
units has been decreased by approximately $620,000, and its distributions in excess of net income have been decreased by $27.6 million. There was no effect on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows for 2007 or 2006.

During 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized deferred gains of $2.1 million and approximately $117,000,
respectively, related to the subsequent sale of four properties by DIK-JV’s to third parties. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008 the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment as an immaterial out-of-period correction to its equity in
income of real estate partnerships of $2.2 million to reverse the recognition of previously deferred gains. As further described in Note 18, the Company also corrected the gains reported in its September 30, 2008 Form 10-Q by a reduction of
$10.6 million, net of minority interest in exchangeable operating partnership units, or $.15 per diluted share related to partial sales to a DIK-JV that occurred in September 2008.

3.

Real Estate Investments

During 2008, the Company did not
have any acquisition activity other than through its investments in real estate partnerships. During 2007, the Company acquired five shopping centers for a purchase price of $106.0 million which included the assumption of $42.3 million in debt,
recorded net of a $1.2 million debt discount. Acquired lease intangible assets and acquired lease intangible liabilities of $9.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively, were recorded for these acquisitions. The acquisitions in 2007 were accounted
for in accordance with the provisions of Statement 141 and their results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

4.

Discontinued Operations

The Company maintains a
conservative capital structure to fund its growth program without compromising its investment-grade ratings. This approach is founded on a self-funding business model which utilizes center “recycling” as a key component and requires
ongoing monitoring of each center to ensure that it meets Regency’s investment standards. This recycling strategy calls for the Company to sell non-strategic assets and re-deploy the proceeds into new, high-quality developments and acquisitions
that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns.

During 2008, the Company sold 100% of its ownership
interest in seven properties in development and three operating properties for net proceeds of $86.2 million. The combined operating income and gains on sales of these properties and properties classified as held-for-sale were reclassified to
discontinued operations. The revenues from properties included in discontinued operations were $17.7 million, $19.3 million, and $28.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The operating income and gains
on sales of properties included in discontinued operations are reported both net of minority interest of exchangeable operating partnership units and income taxes, if the property is sold by the TRS, and are summarized as follows for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively (in thousands):

Investments in Real Estate Partnerships

The
Company’s investments in real estate partnerships were $383.4 million and $401.9 million (as restated) at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net income or loss from these partnerships, which includes all operating results and gains
on sales of properties within the joint ventures, is allocated to the Company in accordance with the respective partnership agreements. Such allocations of net income or loss are recorded in equity in income of investments in real estate
partnerships in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between the carrying amount of these investments and the underlying equity in net assets was $77.3 million and $58.1 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The net difference is accreted to income over the expected useful lives of the properties and other intangible assets, which range in lives from 10 to 40 years.

Cash distributions of earnings from operations from investments in real estate partnerships are presented in cash flows provided by operating activities
in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash distributions from the sale of a property or loan proceeds received from the placement of debt on a property included in investments in real estate partnerships are presented in cash
flows provided by investing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Investments in real estate partnerships
are primarily composed of co-investment partnerships where the Company invests with three co-investment partners and an open-end real estate fund (“Regency Retail Partners” or the “Fund”), as further described below. In addition
to earning its pro-rata share of net income or loss in each of these partnerships, the Company receives market-based fees for asset management, property management, leasing, investment, and financing services. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, the
Company received fees from these co-investment partnerships of $31.7 million, $29.1 million, and $22.1 million, respectively. Investments in real estate partnerships as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 consist of the following (in thousands):

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2008

Investments in real estate partnerships are reported net of deferred gains of $88.3 million and
$69.5 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. After applying the Restricted Gain Method as described in Note 1(b) and Note 2, cumulative deferred gains in 2007 have increased by $30.5 million to correct gains from partial sales
recorded during the periods 2001 to 2005 and have been noted as restated. Cumulative deferred gain amounts related to each co-investment partnership are described below.

The Company co-invests with the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund (“OPERF”) in three co-investment partnerships, two of which the Company has ownership interests of 20% (“Columbia” and
“Columbia II”) and one in which the Company has an ownership interest of 30% (“Cameron”). The Company’s investment in the three co-investment partnerships with OPERF totals $62.0 million (as restated) and represents 1.5% of
the Company’s total assets at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Columbia co-investment partnerships had total assets of $762.7 million and net income of $11.0 million and the Company’s share of its total assets and net
income was $164.8 million and $2.2 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, Columbia owned 14 shopping centers, had total

Company recognizes on property sales to Columbia. During 2006 to 2008, the Company did not sell any properties to Columbia. Since its inception in 2001, the Company has recognized gain of $2.0 million on partial sales to Columbia and deferred gain
of $4.3 million. In December 2008, the Company earned and recognized a $19.7 million Portfolio Incentive Return fee from OPERF based on Columbia’s outperformance of the cumulative NCREIF index since the inception of the partnership and a
cumulative hurdle rate as outlined in the partnership agreement.

As of December 31, 2008, Columbia II owned 16 shopping centers, had
total assets of $327.5 million, and net income of $1.1 million for the year ended. During 2008, Columbia II purchased one operating property from a third party for a purchase price of $28.5 million and the Company contributed $5.7 million for its
proportionate share. The Company has a unilateral DIK right to liquidate the partnership; therefore, the Company has applied the Restricted Gain Method to determine the amount of gain that the Company recognizes on property sales to Columbia II. In

September 2008, Columbia II acquired three completed development properties from the Company for a purchase price of $83.4 million, and as a result, the
Company recognized gain of $9.1 million and deferred gain of $15.7 million. As more thoroughly described in Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the amount of gain previously recorded during September 2008 was subsequently
adjusted by a reduction of $10.6 million and the Company will file a Form 10Q/A to correct its previous filing. During 2006 and 2007, the Company did not sell any properties to Columbia II. Since the inception of Columbia II in 2004, the Company has
recognized gain of $9.1 million on partial sales to Columbia II and deferred $15.7 million. During 2008, Columbia II sold one shopping center to an unrelated party for $13.8 million and recognized a gain of approximately $256,000.

As of December 31, 2008, Cameron owned one shopping center, had total assets of $113.3 million, and a net loss of approximately $187,000 for the year
ended. The partnership agreement does not contain any DIK provisions that would require the Company to apply the Restricted Gain Method. Since its inception in 2004, the Company has not sold any properties to Cameron.

The Company co-invests with the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (“CalSTRS”) in a joint venture (“RegCal”) in which
the Company has a 25% ownership interest. As of December 31, 2008, RegCal owned seven shopping centers, had total assets of $158.1 million, and net income of $5.9 million for the year ended. The Company has a unilateral DIK right to liquidate
the partnership; therefore, the Company has applied the Restricted Gain Method to determine the amount of gain that the Company recognizes on property sales to RegCal. During 2006 to 2008, the Company did not sell any properties to RegCal. Since its
inception in 2004, the Company has recognized gain of $10.1 million on partial sales to RegCal and deferred gain of $3.4 million. During 2008, RegCal sold one shopping center to an unrelated party for $9.5 million and recognized a gain of $4.2
million.

The Company co-invests with Macquarie CountryWide Trust of Australia (“MCW”) in five co-investment partnerships, two in
which the Company has an ownership interest of 25% (collectively “MCWR I”), two in which the Company has an ownership interest of 24.95% (“MCWR II” and “MCWR III”), and one in which the Company has an ownership interest
of 16.35% (“MCWR-DESCO”). The Company’s investment in the five co-investment partnerships with MCW totals $235.0 million and represents 5.7% of the Company’s total assets at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the
MCW co-investment partnerships had total assets of $3.4 billion and net income of $11.6 million and the Company’s share of its total assets and net income was $823.9 million and $2.1 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, MCWR I owned 42 shopping centers, had total assets of $593.9 million, and net income of $11.1 million for the year ended.
The Company has a unilateral DIK right to liquidate the partnership; therefore, the Company has applied the Restricted Gain Method to determine the amount of gain the Company recognizes on property sales to MCWR I. During 2006 to 2008, the Company
did not sell any properties to MCWR I. Since its inception in 2001, the Company has recognized gains of $27.5 million on partial sales to MCWR I and deferred gains of $46.9 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, under the terms of the MCWR I
partnership agreement, MCW elected to dissolve the partnership. In January 2009, the Company began liquidating the partnership through a DIK, which provides for distributing the properties to each partner under an alternating selection process,
ultimately in proportion to the value of each partner’s respective partnership interest as determined by appraisal. Total value of the properties based on appraisals, net of debt, is estimated to be approximately $482.7 million. The properties
which the Company receives through the DIK will be recorded at the amount of the carrying value

of the Company’s equity investment, net of deferred gain. The dissolution is expected to be completed during 2009 subject to required lender consents
for ownership transfer.

As of December 31, 2008, MCWR II owned 85 shopping centers, had total assets of $2.4 billion and net income of
$5.6 million for the year ended. During 2008, MCWR II sold a portfolio of seven shopping centers to an unrelated party for $108.1 million and recognized a gain of $8.9 million. At December 31, 2008, the partnership agreement did not contain any
DIK provisions that would require the Company to apply the Restricted Gain Method. However, in January 2009, the partnership agreement was amended to include DIK provisions; therefore, the Company will apply the Restricted Gain Method if additional
properties are sold to MCWR II in the future. During the period 2006 to 2008, the Company did not sell any properties to MCWR II. Since its inception in 2005, the Company has recognized gain of $2.3 million on partial sales to MCWR II and deferred
gain of approximately $766,000. In June 2008, the Company earned additional acquisition fees of $5.2 million (the “Contingent Acquisition Fees”) deferred from the original acquisition date since the Company achieved the cumulative targeted
income levels specified in the Amended and Restated Income Target Agreement between Regency and MCW dated March 22, 2006. The Contingent Acquisition Fees recognized were limited to that percentage of MCWR II, or 75.05%, of the joint venture not
owned by the Company and amounted to $3.9 million.

As of December 31, 2008, MCWR III owned four shopping centers, had total assets of
$67.5 million, and a net loss of approximately $238,000 for the year ended. At December 31, 2008, the partnership agreement did not contain any DIK provisions that would require the Company to apply the Restricted Gain Method. However, in
January 2009, the partnership agreement was amended to include DIK provisions; therefore, the Company will apply the Restricted Gain Method if additional properties are sold to MCWR III in the future. Since its inception in 2005, the Company has
recognized gain of $14.1 million on partial sales to MCWR III and deferred gain of $4.7 million.

As of December 31, 2008, MCWR-DESCO
owned 32 shopping centers, had total assets of $395.6 million and recorded a net loss of $4.9 million for the year ended primarily related to depreciation and amortization expense, but produced positive cash flow from operations. The partnership
agreement does not contain any DIK provisions that would require the Company to apply the Restricted Gain Method. Since its inception in 2007, the Company has not sold any properties to MCWR-DESCO.

The Company co-invests with Regency Retail Partners (the “Fund”), an open-ended, infinite life investment fund in which the Company has an
ownership interest of 20%. As of December 31, 2008, the Fund owned nine shopping centers, had total assets of $381.2 million, and recorded a net loss of $2.1 million for the year ended. During 2008, the Fund purchased one shopping center from a
third party for $93.3 million that included $66.0 million of assumed mortgage debt and the Company contributed $18.7 million for the Company’s proportionate share of the purchase price. During 2008, the Fund also acquired one property in
development from the Company for a sales price of $74.5 million and the Company recognized a gain of $4.7 million after excluding its ownership interest. The partnership agreement does not contain any DIK provisions that would require the Company to
apply the Restricted Gain Method. Since its inception in 2006, the Company has recognized gains of $71.6 million on partial sales to the Fund and deferred gains of $17.9 million.

Income Taxes

The net book basis of the Company’s
real estate assets exceeds the tax basis by approximately $97.5 million and $161.2 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily due to the difference between the cost basis of the assets acquired and their carryover basis
recorded for tax purposes.

The following summarizes the tax status of dividends paid during the respective years:

Regency Realty Group, Inc. (“RRG”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RCLP, is a Taxable REIT
Subsidiary (“TRS”) as defined in Section 856(l) of the Code. RRG is subject to federal and state income taxes and files separate tax returns. Income tax expense is included in other expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements
of Operations and consists of the following for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 (in thousands):

Income tax (benefit) expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income
tax rate of 34% to pretax income of RRG for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively as follows (in thousands):

All other items principally represent the tax effect of gains associated with the sale of
properties to unconsolidated ventures.

RRG had net deferred tax assets of $17.1 million and $11.6 million (as restated) at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the deferred tax assets relate to deferred gains, deferred interest expense, and tax costs capitalized on projects under development. No valuation allowance was provided and the Company
believes it is more likely than not that the future benefits associated with these deferred tax assets will be realized.

Included in the
income tax (benefit) expense disclosed above, the Company has approximately $600,000 of state income tax expense at RCLP for the Texas Gross Margin Tax recorded in other expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations in both 2007
and 2008.

The Company accounts for uncertainties in income tax law in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). Under FIN 48, tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be
sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax
authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate
for all open tax years (after 2004 for federal and state) based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.

During 2008, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) commenced an examination of the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for 2006 and 2007 which
should be complete by June 2009. The IRS has not proposed any significant adjustments to the open tax years under audit.

Notes Payable and Unsecured Credit Facilities

The
Company’s outstanding debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007 consists of the following (in thousands):



Index to Financial Statements

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2008

During 2008, the Company placed a $62.5 million mortgage loan on a property. The loan has a
nine-year term and is interest only at an all-in coupon rate of 6.0% (or 230 basis points over an interpolated 9-year US Treasury).

On
March 5, 2008, Regency entered into a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank and a group of other banks to provide the Company with a $341.5 million, three-year term loan facility (the “Term Facility”). The Term Facility includes a
term loan amount of $227.7 million plus a $113.8 million revolving credit facility that is accessible at the Company’s discretion. The term loan has a variable interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 105 basis points which was 3.330% at
December 31, 2008 and the revolving portion has a variable interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 90 basis points. The proceeds from the funding of the Term Facility were used to reduce the balance on the unsecured line of credit (the
“Line”). The balance on the Term Facility was $227.7 million at December 31, 2008.

During 2007, RCLP completed the sale of
$400.0 million of ten-year senior unsecured notes. The 5.875% notes are due June 15, 2017 and were priced at 99.527% to yield 5.938%. The net proceeds were used to reduce the unsecured line of credit (the “Line”).

On February 12, 2007, Regency entered into a new loan agreement under the Line with a commitment of $600.0 million and the right to expand the Line
by an additional $150.0 million subject to additional lender syndication. The Line has a four-year term with a one-year extension at the Company’s option and a current interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points subject to maintaining corporate
credit and senior unsecured ratings at BBB+.

Contractual interest rates were 1.338% and 5.425% at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, based on LIBOR plus 40 basis points and LIBOR plus 55 basis points, respectively. The balance on the Line was $70.0 million and $208.0 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Including both the Line commitment and the Term Facility (collectively, “Unsecured credit facilities”), Regency has $941.5 million of total
capacity and the spread paid is dependent upon the Company maintaining specific investment-grade ratings. The Company is also required to comply with certain financial covenants such as Minimum Net Worth, Ratio of Total Liabilities to Gross Asset
Value (“GAV”) and Ratio of Recourse Secured Indebtedness to GAV, Ratio of Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) to Fixed Charges, and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured
financing. As of December 31, 2008, the Company is in compliance with all financial covenants for the Unsecured credit facilities. The Unsecured credit facilities are used primarily to finance the acquisition and development of real estate, but
are also available for general working-capital purposes.

Notes payable consist of secured mortgage loans and unsecured public debt. Mortgage loans may be
prepaid, but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums. Mortgage loans are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest, and mature over various terms through 2018, whereas, interest on unsecured public debt is payable
semi-annually and the debt matures over various terms through 2017. The Company intends to repay mortgage loans at maturity with proceeds from the Unsecured credit facilities. Fixed interest rates on mortgage notes payable range from 5.22% to 8.95%
and average 6.32%. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had one variable rate mortgage loan with an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points maturing in 2009.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses
derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to interest rate risks. In order to manage the volatility relating to interest rate risk, the Company may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. None of the
Company’s derivatives are designated as fair value hedges and the Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

All interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting under Statement 133 as cash flow hedges. Realized losses associated with the swaps settled in 2004 and 2005 and unrealized gains or losses associated with the swaps
entered into in 2006 have been included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Unrealized gains or losses will not be amortized until such
time that the probable debt issuances are completed in 2010 and 2011 as long as the swaps continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The unamortized balance of the realized losses is being amortized as additional interest expense over the original
ten year terms of the hedged loans. The adjustment to interest expense recorded in 2008, 2007, and 2006 related to previously settled swaps is $1.3 million and the unamortized balance at December 31, 2008 and 2007 is $7.8 million and $9.1
million, respectively.

Terms and conditions for the outstanding derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges as of
December 31, 2008 were as follows (dollars in thousands):



Index to Financial Statements

Regency Centers Corporation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2008

The Company has $428.3 million of fixed rate debt maturing in 2010 and 2011 that has a weighted
average fixed interest rate of 8.07%, which includes $400.0 million of unsecured long-term debt. During 2006 the Company entered into four forward-starting interest rate swaps (the “Swaps”) totaling $396.7 million with fixed rates of
5.399%, 5.415%, 5.399%, and 5.415%. The Company designated these Swaps as cash flow hedges to fix the future interest rates on $400.0 million of the financing expected to occur in 2010 and 2011. As a result of a decline in 10 year Treasury interest
rates since the inception of the Swaps, the fair value of the Swaps as of December 31, 2008 is reflected as a liability of $83.7 million in the Company’s accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. It remains highly probable that the
forecasted transactions will occur as projected at the inception of the Swaps and therefore, the change in fair value of the Swaps is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. To the
extent that future 10-year treasury rates (at the future settlement dates) are higher than current rates, this liability will decline. If a liability exists at the dates the Swaps are settled, the liability will be amortized over the term of the
respective debt issuances as additional interest expense in addition to the stated interest rates on the new issuances. In the case of $196.7 million of the Swaps, Regency continues to expect to issue new secured or unsecured debt for a term of 7 to
12 years during the period between June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2010. In the case of $200.0 million of the Swaps, Regency continues to expect to issue new debt for a term of 7 to 12 years during the period between March 30, 2010 and
March 30, 2011. The Company continuously monitors the capital markets and evaluates its ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund its commitments. Based upon the current capital markets, Regency’s current credit ratings, and
the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that it owns which could collateralize borrowings, the Company expects that it will successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund its obligations. However, in the current environment,
interest rates on new issuances are expected to be significantly higher than on historical issuances. An increase of 1.0% in the interest rate of new debt issues above that of maturing debt would result in additional annual interest expense of $4.3
million in addition to the impact of the annual amortization that would be incurred as a result of settling the Swaps.

Fair Value Measurements

Derivative Financial
Instruments

The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow
analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, and implied
volatilities. To comply with the provisions of Statement 157, the Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair
value measurements.

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2
of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its



Index to Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties.

The following disclosures represent additional fair value measurements of assets and liabilities
that are not recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Notes Payable

The carrying value of the Company’s variable rate notes payable and the Unsecured credit facilities are based upon a spread above LIBOR
which is lower than the spreads available in the current credit markets, causing the fair value of such variable rate debt to be below its carrying value. The fair value of fixed rate loans are estimated using cash flows
discounted at current market rates available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities. Fixed rate loans assumed in connection with real estate acquisitions are recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at fair
value at the time of acquisition. Based on the estimates used by the Company, the fair value of notes payable and the Unsecured credit facilities was approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Minority Interests

As of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, Regency had 468,211 and 473,611 redeemable OP Units outstanding, respectively. The redemption value of the redeemable OP Units is based on the closing market price of Regency’s common stock, which was $46.70 and
$64.49 per share as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, an aggregated redemption value of $21.9 million and $30.5 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2008, the Company held a majority interest in four consolidated entities with specified termination dates through 2049. The minority owners’ interests in these entities will be settled upon
termination by distribution or transfer of either cash or specific assets of the underlying entities. The estimated fair value of minority interests in entities with specified termination dates was approximately $9.5 million and $10.2 million at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Their related carrying value was $6.3 million and $5.7 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively which is recorded in limited partners’ interest in consolidated partnerships in
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

compensation in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 as follows, the components of which are further described below (in thousands):

The recorded amounts of stock-based compensation expense represent amortization of deferred
compensation related to share-based payments in accordance with Statement 123(R). During 2008, compensation expense declined as a result of the Company reducing estimated payout amounts related to incentive compensation tied directly to Company
performance. The Company recorded a cumulative adjustment during 2008 of $12.7 million relating to this change in estimate of which $4.1 million had been previously capitalized. Compensation expense specifically identifiable to development and
leasing activities is capitalized and included above. During the three years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 compensation expense of approximately $3.6 million, $7.6 million, and $6.9 million, respectively, was capitalized.

The Company established the Plan under which the Board of Directors may grant stock options and other stock-based awards to officers, directors, and
other key employees. The Plan allows the Company to issue up to 5.0 million shares in the form of common stock or stock options, but limits the issuance of common stock excluding stock options to no more than 2.75 million shares. At
December 31, 2008, there were approximately 2.3 million shares available for grant under the Plan either through options or restricted stock. The Plan also limits outstanding awards to no more than 12% of outstanding common stock.

Stock options are granted under the Plan with an exercise price equal to the stock’s price at the date of grant. All stock options
granted have ten-year lives, contain vesting terms of one to five years from the date of grant and some have dividend equivalent rights. Stock options granted prior to 2005 also contained “reload” rights, which allowed an option holder the
right to receive new options each time existing options were exercised, if the existing options were exercised under specific criteria provided for in the Plan. In 2005 and 2007, the Company acquired the “reload” rights of existing
employees’ and directors’ stock options from the option holders, substantially canceling all of the “reload” rights on existing stock options in exchange for new options. These new stock options vest 25% per year and are
expensed ratably over a four-year period beginning in year of grant in accordance with Statement 123(R). Options granted under the reload buy-out plan do not earn dividend equivalents.

December 31, 2008

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton
closed-form (“Black-Scholes”) option valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data and other factors to estimate option exercises
and employee terminations within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free
rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company believes that the use of the Black-Scholes model meets the fair value measurement objectives of
Statement 123(R) and reflects all substantive characteristics of the instruments being valued. No stock options were granted during 2008. The following table represents the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for options
granted in the respective year:

The following table reports stock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2008:

The weighted-average grant price for stock options granted during the years 2007 and 2006 was
$88.49 and $70.98, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $2.3 million, $20.2 million, and $17.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, there was
approximately $88,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted under the Plan all of which is expected to be recognized in 2009. The Company received cash proceeds for stock option exercises of $1.0 million, $2.4
million, and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,

2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company issues new shares to fulfill option exercises from its authorized shares available.

The following table presents information regarding non-vested option activity during the year ended December 31, 2008:

The Company grants restricted stock under the Plan to its employees as a form of long-term
compensation and retention. The terms of each grant vary depending upon the participant’s responsibilities and position within the Company. The Company’s stock grants can be categorized into three types: (a) 4-year vesting,
(b) performance-based vesting, and (c) 8-year cliff vesting.

•

The 4-year vesting grants vest 25% per year beginning on the date of grant. These grants are not subject to future performance measures, and if such vesting
criteria are not met, the compensation cost previously recognized would be reversed.

•

Performance-based vesting grants are earned subject to future performance measurements, which include individual goals, annual growth in earnings, compounded
three-year growth in earnings, and a three-year total shareholder return peer comparison (“TSR Grant”). Once the performance criteria are met and the actual number of shares earned is determined, certain shares will vest immediately while
others will vest over an additional service period.

•

The 8-year cliff vesting grants fully vest at the end of the eighth year from the date of grant; however, as a result of the achievement of future performance,
primarily growth in earnings, the vesting of these grants may be accelerated over a shorter term.

Performance-based
vesting grants and 8-year cliff vesting grants are currently only granted to the Company’s senior management. The Company considers the likelihood of meeting the performance criteria based upon managements’ estimates and analysis of future
earnings growth from which it determines the amounts recognized as expense on a periodic basis. The Company determines the grant date fair value of TSR Grants based upon a Monte Carlo Simulation model. Compensation expense is measured at the grant
date and recognized over the vesting period.

The following table reports non-vested restricted stock activity during the year ended
December 31, 2008:

The weighted-average grant price for restricted stock granted during the years 2008, 2007, and
2006 was $63.76, $84.52 and $63.75, respectively. The total intrinsic value of restricted stock vested during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $23.8 million, $29.7 million and $26.3 million, respectively. As of
December 31, 2008, there was $16.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock granted under the Plan, when recognized is recorded in additional paid in capital of the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss). This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the next four years, through 2012. The Company issues new restricted stock from its authorized shares available at the
date of grant.

The Company maintains a 401 (k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees, which permits participants to
defer up to the maximum allowable amount determined by the IRS of their eligible compensation. This deferred compensation, together with Company matching contributions equal to 100% of employee deferrals up to a maximum of $3,700 of their eligible
compensation, is fully vested and funded as of December 31, 2008. Costs related to the matching portion of the plan were approximately $1.5 million, $1.3 million, and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively.

Operating Leases

Future minimum rents under
non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2008, excluding both tenant reimbursements of operating expenses and additional percentage rent based on tenants’ sales volume, are as follows (in thousands):

The shopping centers’ tenant base includes primarily national and regional supermarkets, drug
stores, discount department stores and other retailers and, consequently, the credit risk is concentrated in the retail industry. There were no tenants that individually represented more than 6% of the Company’s annualized future minimum rents.

The Company has shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the
underlying land to Regency to construct and/or operate a shopping center. Ground leases expire through 2085 and in most cases provide for renewal options. In addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from
which it conducts its business. Office leases expire through 2017 and in most cases provide for renewal options. Leasehold improvements are capitalized, recorded as tenant improvements, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the
improvements or the lease term. The following table summarizes the future obligations under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands):

Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is involved in
litigation on a number of matters and is subject to certain claims which arise in the normal course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or liquidity. The Company is also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to real estate pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older
shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks. The Company believes that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations. The Company has placed environmental
insurance, when possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate its environmental risk. The Company monitors the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediates the sites.
The Company also has legal obligations to remediate certain sites and is in the process of doing so. The Company estimates the cost associated with these legal obligations to be approximately $3.2 million, all of which has been reserved in accounts
payable and other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company believes that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on its financial position, liquidity, or
operations; however, it can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to the shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material
environmental condition not known to it; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in
applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to the Company.

Restructuring Charges

In November 2008, the Company
announced a restructuring plan designed to further align employee headcount with the Company’s projected workload. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $2.4 million for employee severance and benefits related to employee
reductions across various functional areas in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The restructuring charges included severance benefits for 50 employees with no future service requirement
and were completed by January 2009 using cash from operations. The charges for the year ended December 31, 2008 associated with the restructuring program are as follows:

Summary of Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

The
following table sets forth selected Quarterly Financial Data for Regency on a historical basis as of and for each of the quarters and years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and has been derived from the accompanying consolidated financial
statements as reclassified for discontinued operations. As previously disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 12, 2009, the Company’s Audit Committee determined on March 12, 2009, after discussions with
management, that the Company’s previously-issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008 should no longer be relied upon because of an error in the Company’s calculation of
the gain on the sale of properties to certain co-investment partnerships. Such error came to light as a result of the determination that for certain of the Company’s co-investment partnerships, the in-kind liquidation provisions contained
within such co-investment partnership agreements constitute in-substance call/put options, a form of continuing involvement under Statement 66. As a result, the Company has reevaluated its accounting policy for such sales and has adopted a
Restricted Gain Method of gain recognition, as described more fully in Note 1(b), which considers the Company’s ability to receive property previously sold to a co-investment partnership upon liquidation. The revised method of recognizing gain
on sale of properties to co-investment partnerships with in-kind liquidation provisions has been applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As a result, in the financial data presented below, the Company
restated its reported gains on sales of properties in the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008 and reduced net income for those periods by $10.6 million or $.15 per share as detailed below. The Company also recorded a correction to
previously reported assets ($28.2 million reduction), minority interests ($620,000 reduction), and stockholders’ equity ($27.6 million reduction) in the 2006 opening consolidated balance sheet related to the cumulative correction of gains
reported as described in the note below. There was also no effect on the operating, financing or investing cash flows in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for any quarter of any year previously presented.

total assets decreased $28.2 million, minority interests decreased approximately $620,000, and stockholders’ equity decreased $27.6 million as of the end of each quarter presented.

Controls and Procedures

Management’s
Consideration of Controls over Property Sales to Co-Investment Partnerships

As a result of the error correction and restatement
described in Note 2 to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company re-evaluated the effectiveness of internal controls related to accounting for gains on property sales to co-investment partnerships prior to the
filing of this Form 10-K. As part of the re-evaluation, we considered the internal controls necessary to effectively ensure that complex business transactions are properly accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Relevant
internal controls should ensure that:

•

Complex business transactions and provisions are identified.

•

Appropriate personnel discuss important accounting matters.

•

Relevant GAAP is identified, including any significant guidance changes.

•

Professional judgment is exercised in applying GAAP to complex business transactions.

•

Professional judgment is evaluated objectively by the Audit Committee.

The Company identified internal controls related to gains on sales to co-investment partnerships and re-evaluated the effectiveness of those controls in
achieving the objectives noted above. The controls identified include:

•

Appropriate accounting personnel review co-investment partnership agreements prior to execution and amendments thereafter and property sales and distributions from
co-investment partnerships to identify accounting implications.

•

Accounting personnel communicate with senior management to identify all relevant matters.

•

Experienced accounting personnel review GAAP to identify relevant guidance.

•

Management reviews GAAP guidance internally to determine how to appropriately account for complex transactions.

•

After internal discussions, management consults with appropriate accounting and legal experts, determines the appropriate application of GAAP and prepares financial
statements.

•

Senior management communicates to the Audit Committee any significant changes in accounting policies as a result of new transactions or changes in GAAP. The
Committee reviews management’s assessment and concurs, if in agreement. Any differences in assessment would be re-evaluated by management and resubmitted to the Committee.

After re-evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of the controls noted above, management has determined that we have effective internal
controls to ensure that complex business transactions are properly accounted for under GAAP. Management has determined that the restatement as described in Note 18 does not indicate a material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting. Management has determined the restatement of quarterly financial information and cumulative balance sheet information was the result of a misinterpretation of relevant guidance in an area where clear guidance is not available and no
consensus on accounting treatment has been established among accounting or industry experts. Therefore, the Company applied its judgment based on the best information available.

In evaluating the gain treatment, the Company properly identified provisions with significant accounting implications; identified relevant GAAP,
including SFAS No. 66; discussed important accounting matters with internal personnel, and accounting and legal experts; and exercised professional judgment in applying GAAP to the partial gains on property sales to co-investment partnerships.



Index to Financial Statements

The Company has concluded that the controls noted above provide reasonable assurance that GAAP will be
applied appropriately to future complex business transactions.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

KPMG LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued a report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting.

Regency’s system of internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in
Internal Controls

In connection with the preparation of the year-end financial statements, management updated its policies and
procedures to implement the Restricted Gain Method as described in Note 1(b) to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Restricted Gain Method ensures maximum gain deferral on property sales to certain co-investment
partnership with distribution-in-kind provisions upon liquidation. The policy and procedure updates consist of new procedures and end user computing applications for the calculation of gain, and monitoring for distributions-in-kind and compliance
with the new policies.

Other than described above, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial
reporting identified in connection with this evaluation that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008 and that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.
