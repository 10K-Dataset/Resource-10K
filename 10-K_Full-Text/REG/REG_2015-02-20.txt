EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2014

of Regency Centers Corporation and Regency Centers, L.P.  Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Regency Centers Corporation” or the “Parent Company” mean Regency Centers Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries; and references to “Regency Centers, L.P.” or the “Operating Partnership” mean Regency Centers, L.P. and its controlled subsidiaries.  The term “the Company” or “Regency” means the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, collectively.

The Parent Company is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and the general partner of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units (“Units”).  As of

December 31, 2014

, the Parent Company owned approximately

99.8%

of the Units in the Operating Partnership and the remaining limited Units are owned by investors.  The Parent Company owns all of the Series 6 and 7 Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.

The Company believes combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:

•

Enhances investors' understanding of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;

•

Eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation; and

•

Creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

Management operates the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership as one business.  The management of the Parent Company consists of the same individuals as the management of the Operating Partnership.  These individuals are officers of the Parent Company and employees of the Operating Partnership.

The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company.  The Parent Company is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.  As a result, the Parent Company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership.  The Parent Company does not hold any indebtedness, but guarantees all of the unsecured public debt and approxim

ately

15%

of the

secured debt of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership holds all the assets of the Company and retains the ownership interests in the Company's joint ventures.  Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by the Parent Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company's business.  These sources include the Operating Partnership's operations, its direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of partnership units.

Stockholders' equity, partners' capital, and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and those of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units, as well as Series 6 and 7 Preferred Units owned by the Parent Company.  The limited partners' units in the Operating Partnership owned by third parties are accounted for in partners' capital in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and outside of stockholders' equity in noncontrolling interests in the Parent Company's financial statements.  The Series 6 and 7 Preferred Units owned by the Parent Company are eliminated in consolidation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and are classified as preferred units of general partner in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership.

In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, there are sections in this report that separately discuss the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, including separate financial statements, controls and procedures sections, and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications.  In the sections that combine disclosure for the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company.

As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership.  Therefore, while stockholders' equity and partners' capital differ as discussed above, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.

Such risks and uncertainties are described further in the Item 1A.

Risk Factors

below.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto of Regency Centers Corporation and Regency Centers, L.P. appearing elsewhere herein.  We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to such forward-looking statements to reflect events or uncertainties after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of uncertain events.

PART I

Item 1.    Business

Regency Centers began its operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993, and currently owns direct or partial interests in 322 shopping centers, the majority of which are grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers.  Our centers are located in the top markets of 23 states and the District of Columbia, and contain 38.2 million square feet of gross leasable area, or 28.4 million square feet when including only our pro rata share of the 120 centers partially owned through co-investment partnerships.

Our mission is to be the preeminent grocery-anchored shopping center owner and developer through:

•

First-rate performance of our exceptionally merchandised and located national portfolio;

•

Value-enhancing services of the best team of professionals in the business;

•

Creation of superior growth in shareholder value.

Our Strategy is to:

•

Sustain average annual 3% net operating income (“NOI”) growth from a high-quality portfolio of community and neighborhood shopping centers;

•

Develop new high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program;

•

Cost-effectively enhance our already strong balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital, provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns;

•

Engage a talented and dedicated team that operates efficiently and is recognized as a leader in the real estate industry and sustainability initiatives.

Sustain average annual 3% NOI growth from high-quality portfolio of community and neighborhood shopping centers:

•

Own and develop centers that are located at key corners in our nation’s most attractive metro areas;

•

Target trade areas characterized by their strong demographics and consumer buying power, and draw shoppers to our centers with highly productive anchor tenants;

•

Attract the best national, regional and local retailers and restaurants;

•

Pursue initiatives that reinforce the underlying quality of our portfolio and maximize long-term growth such as “Fresh Look,” an operating philosophy that guides our merchandising and place-making programs;

•

Fortify future NOI growth by rigorously reviewing our portfolio to identify low growth assets for disposition;

•

Opportunistically upgrade our portfolio by acquiring high quality shopping centers with superior upside in NOI growth funded from the sale of low growth assets.

Develop new high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program:

•

We have an existing presence in our key markets with in-house expertise and anchor relationships;

•

Long-term ownership of shopping center developments located in desirable infill markets;

•

Anchor developments with dominant, national and regional chains and high volume specialty grocers;

•

Limit size of program to manage total development exposure and risk;

•

Create additional value through redevelopment of existing centers to benefit the operating portfolio;

•

Fund development program primarily from the sale of low-growth assets in the existing portfolio.

Cost-effectively enhance an already strong balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital, provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns:

•

We have access to multiple sources of debt and equity through the capital markets and co-investment partnerships;


•

Fund development and acquisitions from free cash flow, a disciplined match-funding strategy of selling low growth assets, and accessing favorably priced equity;

•

Further reduce leverage when appropriate through organic growth in earnings and accessing the capital markets prudently;

•

Rigorously manage our $800 million line of credit and maintain substantial uncommitted capacity;

•

Maintain a large pool of unencumbered assets and excellent relationships with mortgage lenders;

•

Maintain a well laddered debt maturity profile.

Engage a talented and dedicated team that operates efficiently and is recognized as a leader in the real estate industry and sustainability initiatives:

•

We reflect our values by executing and successfully meeting our commitments to our people and our communities, a tradition we have embraced for over 50 years;

•

Foster a values-based culture, offering a comprehensive benefits package and an engaging workplace environment;

•

Believe in unwavering standards of honesty and integrity and build our reputation by maintaining the highest ethical principles.

•

Offer a challenging, safe and dynamic work environment and support the professional development and the personal life of each employee.

•

Encourage employees to achieve their personal health goals through a robust wellness program focused on education, awareness and prevention.

•

Contribute to the betterment of our communities by supporting philanthropic programs with employee contribution matching and paid time off to volunteer.

Sustainability

We recognize the importance of operating in a sustainable manner and are committed to reducing our environmental impact, including energy and water use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste.  We are committed to transparency with regard to our sustainability performance, risks and opportunities, and will continue to increase disclosure using industry accepted reporting frameworks.   We believe our commitment to sustainability supports the Company in achieving key strategic objectives, leads to better risk management, enhances our relationships with key stakeholders, and is in the best interest of our shareholders.

Competition

We are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues, number of properties, GLA, and market capitalization.  There are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets, including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers.  This results in competition for attracting anchor tenants, as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites.  We believe that our competitive advantages are driven by:

•

our locations within our market areas;

•

the design and high quality of our shopping centers;

•

the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers;

•

our relationships with our anchor tenants and our side-shop and out-parcel retailers;

•

our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers; and,

•

our ability to source and develop new shopping centers.

Employees

Our headquarters are located at One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida.  We presently maintain 17 market offices nationwide, where we conduct management, leasing, construction, and investment activities.  As of

December 31, 2014

, we had 370 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Compliance with Governmental Regulations

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  The cost of required remediation and the owner's liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner.  The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral.  While we have a number of properties that could require


or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation, known environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation, various state-regulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state, and existing accrued liabilities for remediation.

Executive Officers

Our executive officers are appointed each year by our Board of Directors.  Each of our executive officers has been employed by us in the position indicated in the list or positions indicated in the pertinent notes below.  Each of our executive officers has been employed by us for more than five years.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Risk Factors Related to Our Industry and Real Estate Investments

A shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to internet sales may have an adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow.

Many retailers operating brick and mortar stores have made Internet sales a vital piece of their business.  Although many of the retailers in our shopping centers either provide services or sell groceries, such that their customer base does not have a tendency toward online shopping, the shift to internet sales may adversely impact our retail tenants' sales causing those retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future.  This shift could adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates, which would impact our revenues and cash flows.

Downturns in the retail industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow.

Our properties consist primarily of grocery-anchored shopping centers.  Our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space.  The market for retail space could be adversely affected by any of the following:

•

Weakness in the national, regional and local economies, which could adversely impact consumer spending and retail sales and in turn tenant demand for space and lead to increased store closings;

•

Adverse financial conditions for grocery and retail anchors;

•

Continued consolidation in the retail sector;

•

Excess amount of retail space in our markets;

•

Reduction in the demand by tenants to occupy our shopping centers as a result of reduced consumer demand for certain retail categories;

•

The growth of super-centers and warehouse club retailers, such as those operated by Wal-Mart and Costco, and their adverse effect on traditional grocery chains;

•

The impact of changing energy costs on consumers and its consequential effect on retail spending; and

•

Consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States.

To the extent that any of these conditions occur, they are likely to impact market rents for retail space, occupancy in the operating portfolios, our ability to sell, acquire or develop properties, and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders.

Our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected if economic or market conditions deteriorate where our properties are geographically concentrated, which may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties.

The economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated greatly influence our financial performance.  During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, our properties in

California

,

Florida

, and

Texas

accounted for

30.6%

,

11.3%

, and

10.0%

, respectively, of our net operating income from Consolidated Properties plus our pro-rata share from Unconsolidated Properties ("pro-rata basis").  Our revenues and cash available to pay expenses, maintain our properties, and for distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions, such as supply of or demand for retail space, deteriorate in

California

,

Florida

, or

Texas

relative to other geographic areas.

Our success depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants.

Anchor tenants occupy large amounts of square footage, pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property.

We derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as

Kroger

,

Publix

, and

Safeway

, who accounted for

4.5%

,

3.8%

, and

2.3%

, respectively, of our total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis, for the year ended

December 31, 2014

.  Our net income could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a significant tenant:

•

Becomes bankrupt or insolvent;

•

Experiences a downturn in its business;

•

Materially defaults on its leases;

•

Does not renew its leases as they expire; or

•

Renews at lower rental rates.


Some anchors have the right to vacate and prevent re-tenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term.  Vacated anchor space, including space owned by the anchor, can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant's customer drawing power.  If a significant tenant vacates a property, co-tenancy clauses in select centers may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations.  Co-tenancy clauses have several variants: they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores; they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration; or more commonly, they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center.

A significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants and our net income could be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful.

A significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants (those occupying less than 10,000 square feet).  Smaller shop tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than larger tenants.  Such tenants continue to face increasing competition from non-store retailers and growing e-commerce. In addition, some of these retailers may seek to reduce their store sizes as they increasingly rely on alternative distribution channels, including internet sales, and adjust their square footage needs accordingly. The types of smaller shop tenants vary from retail shops to service providers.  If we are unable to attract the right type or mix of smaller shop tenants into our centers, our net income could be adversely impacted.

We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy.

Although minimum rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores.  In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by that party.

Our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges.

Our long-lived assets, primarily real estate held for investment, are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.  We evaluate whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  Through the evaluation, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated holding periods, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results.  Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.  To the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.

The fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach.   Such cash flow projections consider factors, including expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore are subject to management judgment.  Changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.

These subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income.  There can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets.  Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our net income in the period in which the charge is taken.

Adverse global market and economic conditions could cause us to recognize additional impairment charges or otherwise harm our performance.

We are unable to predict the timing, severity, and length of adverse market and economic conditions.  Adverse market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses, maintain properties, pay distributions to our stock and unit holders, and refinance debt.  During adverse periods, there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation of our properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in their value.  No


assurance can be given that we would be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments in the future.  Our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock.

Unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could have a direct impact on our revenues, revenue growth, and/or net income.

We actively pursue development opportunities.  Development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay the development process.  We may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received.  We incur other risks associated with development activities, including:

•

The risk that we may be unable to lease developments to full occupancy on a timely basis;

•

The risk that occupancy rates and rents of a completed project will not be sufficient to make the project profitable;

•

The risk that development costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project unprofitable;

•

The risk that delays in the development and construction process could increase costs;

•

The risk that we may abandon development opportunities and lose our investment in such opportunities;

•

The risk that the size of our development pipeline will strain the organization's capacity to complete the developments within the targeted timelines and at the expected returns on invested capital;

•

Changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity could have an adverse impact on operating results by reducing the amount of capitalizable internal costs for development projects;  and

•

The lack of cash flow during the construction period.

Our acquisition activities may not produce the returns that we expect.

Our investment strategy includes investing in high-quality shopping centers that are leased to market-dominant grocers, category-leading anchors, specialty retailers, or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities.  The acquisition of properties and/or companies entails risks that include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations:

•

Properties we acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we estimate, which may result in the properties' failure to achieve the returns we projected;

•

Our pre-acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired, which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs or decrease cash flow from the property;

•

Our investigation of a company, property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representations we may receive from such seller, may fail to reveal various liabilities, which could reduce the cash flow from the acquisition or increase our acquisition costs;

•

Our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short,  either of which could result in the property failing to achieve the returns we have projected, either temporarily or for a longer time;

•

We may not recover our costs from an unsuccessful acquisition;

•

Our acquisition activities may distract our management and generate significant costs; and

•

We may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully.

We may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or re-leasing space.

We derive most of our revenue from rent received from our tenants.  We are subject to the risks that, upon expiration or termination of leases, leases for space in our properties may not be renewed, space may not be re-leased, or the terms of renewal or re-lease, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than current lease terms.  As a result, our results of operations and our net income could be adversely impacted.


We may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid.

Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly.  Our inability to respond promptly to unfavorable changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders.

Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business vulnerable to natural disasters and severe weather conditions, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and operating results.

A significant portion of our property gross leasable area is located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, and other natural disasters.  As of

December 31, 2014

, approximately

23.6%

,

15.0%

, and

10.5%

of our property gross leasable area, on a pro-rata basis, was located in

California

,

Florida

, and

Texas

, respectively.  Intense weather conditions during the last decade have caused our cost of property insurance to increase significantly.  We recognize that the frequency and / or intensity of extreme weather events may continue to increase due to climate change, and as a result, our exposure to these events could increase.  These weather conditions also disrupt our business and the business of our tenants, which could affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of residents to remain in or move to the affected area.  Therefore, as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, we face risks, including higher costs, such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums, and disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants.

Should we decide in the future to expand into new markets, we may not be successful, which could adversely affect our

financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

If opportunities arise, we may explore acquisitions of properties in new markets. Each of the risks applicable to our

ability to acquire and integrate successfully and operate properties in our current markets is also applicable in new markets. In

addition, we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and market conditions of the new markets we may

enter, which could adversely affect the results of our expansion into those markets, and we may be unable to achieve our desired return on our investments in new markets. If we are unsuccessful in expanding into new markets, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties could subject us to loss of capital or revenue on those properties.

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage, rental loss, and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties.  We believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate and consistent with industry standards.  There are, however, some types of losses, such as losses from hurricanes, terrorism, wars or earthquakes, for which the insurance levels carried may not be sufficient to fully cover catastrophic losses impacting multiple properties.  In addition, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons or damage to personal or real property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted by tenants or their agents on the properties (including without limitation any environmental contamination), and at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. However, our tenants may not properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles associated with such policies.  Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, such properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.

Loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our business and operations.

We depend on the efforts of our key executive personnel.  Although we believe qualified replacements could be found for our key executives, the loss of their services could adversely affect our business and operations.


We face competition from numerous sources, including other REITs and other real estate owners.

The ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented.  We face competition from other REITs and well capitalized institutional investors, as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition, ownership, and leasing of shopping centers.  We also compete to develop shopping centers with other REITs engaged in development activities as well as with local, regional, and national real estate developers.  This competition may:

•

reduce the number of properties available for acquisition or development;

•

increase the cost of properties available for acquisition or development;

•

hinder our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates and/or reduced rents; and

•

adversely affect our ability to minimize our expenses of operation.

If we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets, our cash flow, and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders, may be adversely affected.

Costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders.

Under various federal, state and local laws, an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.  The cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party. The presence of, or the failure to properly remediate, hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to use the property as collateral for a loan.  Any of these developments could reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.

Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures.

All of our properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities.  Compliance with ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers, and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both.  While the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected.  In addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties.  We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements, and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders.

If we do not maintain the security of tenant-related information, we could incur substantial costs and become subject to litigation.

We have implemented an online payment system where we receive certain information about our tenants that depends upon secure transmissions of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.  A compromise of our security systems that results in information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties.  In addition, a security breach could require us to expend significant resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations.

We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business and disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business.

Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems.  Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees.  If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim.  Any


material interruption in both of our computer systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

Risk Factors Related to Our Co-investment Partnerships and Acquisition Structure

We do not have voting control over our joint venture investments, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued.

We have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of joint venture investments for the acquisition or development of properties.  These investments involve risks not present in a wholly-owned project as we do not have voting control over the ventures, although we do have approval rights over major decisions.  The other partner may (i) have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or (ii) otherwise impede our objectives.  The other partner also may become insolvent or bankrupt.  These factors could limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates.

The termination of our co-investment partnerships could adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.

If co-investment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason, we would lose the asset and property management fees from these co-investment partnerships, which could adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders.

Risk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital Structure

Higher market capitalization rates for our properties could adversely impact our ability to sell properties and fund developments and acquisitions, and could dilute earnings.

As part of our funding strategy, we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile.  These sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments, redevelopments and acquisitions.  An increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale, which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated.  In order to meet the cash requirements of our development program, we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned, which could have a negative impact on our earnings.

We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.

To qualify as a REIT, the Parent Company must, among other things, distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (excluding any net capital gains).  Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations.  We therefore will have to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings.  Our access to debt depends on our credit rating, the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets.  In addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us, we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our joint ventures are eligible to refinance.

In addition, our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing, such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements.  Additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders' interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage.

Without access to external sources of capital, we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales.  Our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate.  If we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales, we may be forced to reduce the amount of, or eliminate altogether, our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business.


Our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.  In addition, we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due.  If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced (i) to dispose of properties, which might result in losses, or (ii) to obtain financing at unfavorable terms, either of which could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders.  If we cannot make required mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage.

Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition.

Our unsecured notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants, including compliance with financial ratios, such as ratio of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio.  Fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders.  Our debt arrangements also restrict our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control.  These covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities.  Moreover, if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements, and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, even in the absence of a payment default.  Many of our debt arrangements, including our unsecured notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured line of credit are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations.  As a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations, and the market value of our stock.

Increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations.

Although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facilities.  Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates.  In addition, increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures, to the extent we have not hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.  This would reduce our future earnings and cash flows, which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders.

We may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax-deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets.

We may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for

partnership interests in our operating partnership, which may result in stockholder dilution. This acquisition structure may have

the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired

properties, and may require that we agree to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through

restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to

maintain their tax bases. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable

absent such restrictions.

Hedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will

not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which could adversely affect us.

From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements that

involve risk, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, and that these

arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes. There can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations. Should we desire to terminate a hedging agreement, there could be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging agreement. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.


Risk Factors Related to the Market Price for Our Debt and Equity Securities

Changes in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our securities.

The market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, many of which are out of our control, including:

•

Actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;

•

Changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;

•

Publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry in general and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REIT's;

•

The ability of our tenants to pay rent and meet their other obligations to us under current lease terms and our ability to re-lease space as leases expire;

•

Increases in market interest rates that drive purchasers of our stock to demand a higher dividend yield;

•

Changes in market valuations of similar companies;

•

Adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;

•

Any future issuances of equity securities;

•

Additions or departures of key management personnel;

•

Strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;

•

Actions by institutional stockholders;

•

Changes in our dividend payments;

•

Speculation in the press or investment community; and

•

General market and economic conditions.

These factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects.  It is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities, including our common stock, will not fall in the future. A decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets. Selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders.

We cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.

Our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:

•

Our financial condition and results of future operations;

•

The terms of our loan covenants; and

•

Our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.

If we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock, it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities.

Changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial results.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), in conjunction with the SEC, has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions, including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the International Accounting Standards Board.  At this time, we are unable to predict with certainty which, if any, proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements, our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants.

Risk Factors Related to Federal Income Tax Laws

If the Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.

We believe that the Parent Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT.  If the Parent Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders.  Many REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex.  The determination that the Parent Company is a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances, some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which


involve questions of interpretation.  For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from specific passive sources, like rent, that are itemized in the REIT tax laws.  There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the REIT requirements.  We are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding capital gains.  The fact that we hold many of our assets through co-investment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements.  Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings, that make it more difficult, or impossible, for the Parent Company to remain qualified as a REIT.

Also, unless the IRS granted relief under certain statutory provisions, the Parent Company would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year it first failed to qualify.  If the Parent Company failed to qualify as a REIT (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we would have to pay significant income taxes, reducing cash available to pay dividends, which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities.  In addition, we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders.  Although we believe that the Parent Company qualifies as a REIT, we cannot assure you that the Parent Company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes.

Even if the Parent Company qualifies as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to pay certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.  For example, if we have net income from “prohibited transactions,” that income will be subject to a 100% tax.  In general, prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.  The determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale.  While we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years, we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions, but there can be no assurance that the IRS would not contend otherwise.

Dividends paid by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.

Subject to limited exceptions, dividends paid by REITs (other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends or returns of capital) are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by "C" corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including the shares of our capital stock.

Foreign stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a "domestically controlled" REIT.

A foreign person disposing of a U.S. real property interest, including shares of a U.S. corporation whose assets consist principally of U.S. real property interests is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition. This tax does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a REIT if the REIT is "domestically controlled." In general, we will be a domestically controlled REIT if at all times during the five-year period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock, less than 50% in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons. If we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled REIT, gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock.

Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.

The REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Generally, income from a hedging transaction we enter into either to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings incurred or to be incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets, or to manage the risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain (or any property which generates such income or gain) that constitutes “qualifying income” for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests applicable to REITs, does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the Code and Treasury Regulations. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, or fail to make the proper tax identifications, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS. The use of a TRS could increase the cost of our hedging activities (because our TRS would be subject to tax on income or gain resulting from hedges entered into by it) or expose us to greater risks than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, net losses in a TRS will generally not provide any tax benefit except for being carried forward for use against future taxable income in the TRS.


Risk Factors Related to Our Ownership Limitations and the Florida Business Corporation Act

Restrictions on the ownership of the Parent Company's capital stock to preserve its REIT status could delay or prevent a change in control.

Ownership of more than 7% by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited, with certain exceptions, by the Parent Company's articles of incorporation, for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a REIT.  This 7% limitation may discourage a change in control and may also (i) deter tender offers for our capital stock, which offers may be attractive to our stockholders, or (ii) limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7% of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control.

The issuance of the Parent Company's capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control.

The Parent Company's articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 10,000,000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued.  The issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.  The provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders.

The following table is a list of the shopping centers, summarized by state and in order of largest holdings, presented for Consolidated Properties (excludes properties owned by unconsolidated co-investment partnerships):

Certain Consolidated Properties are encumbered by mortgage loans of

$541.6 million

, excluding debt premiums and discounts, as of

December 31, 2014

.

The weighted average annual effective rent for the consolidated portfolio of properties, net of tenant concessions, is

$18.30

and

$17.40

per square foot ("SqFT") as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively.


The following table is a list of the shopping centers, summarized by state and in order of largest holdings, presented for Unconsolidated Properties (includes properties owned by unconsolidated co-investment partnerships):

Certain Unconsolidated Properties are encumbered by mortgage loans of

$1.4 billion

, excluding debt premiums and discounts, as of

December 31, 2014

.

The weighted average annual effective rent for the unconsolidated portfolio of properties, net of tenant concessions, is

$17.85

and

The following table summarizes the largest tenants occupying our shopping centers for Consolidated Properties plus our pro-rata share of Unconsolidated Properties, as of

December 31, 2014

, based upon a percentage of total annualized base rent exceeding or equal to 0.5% (GLA and dollars in thousands):

(1)

Stores owned by anchor tenant that are attached to our centers.

Our leases for tenant space under 5,000 square feet generally have terms ranging from three to five years.  Leases greater than 10,000 square feet generally have lease terms in excess of five years, mostly comprised of anchor tenants.  Many of the anchor leases contain provisions allowing the tenant the option of extending the term of the lease at expiration.  Our leases provide for the monthly payment in advance of fixed minimum rent, additional rents calculated as a percentage of the tenant's sales, the tenant's pro-rata share of real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance (“CAM”) expenses, and reimbursement for utility costs if not directly metered.


The following table summarizes lease expirations for the next ten years and thereafter, for our Consolidated and Unconsolidated Properties, assuming no tenants renew their leases (GLA and dollars in thousands):

(1)

Leases currently under month-to-month rent or in process of renewal.

(2)

Minimum rent includes current minimum rent and future contractual rent steps, but excludes additional rent such as percentage rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance reimbursements.

During


, we have a total of


leases expiring, representing

1.8 million

square feet of GLA.  These expiring leases have an average base rent of

$22.07

per SqFT.  The average base rent of new leases signed during


was

$22.02

per SqFT.  During periods of recession or when occupancy is low, tenants have more bargaining power, which may result in rental rate declines on new or renewal leases.  In periods of recovery and/or when occupancy levels are high, landlords have more bargaining power, which generally results in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases.  Based on current economic trends and expectations, and pro-rata percent leased of

95.4%

, we expect to see an overall increase in rental rate on new and renewal leases during


.  Exceptions may arise in certain geographic areas or at specific shopping centers based on the local economic situation, competition, location, and size of the space being leased, among other factors.  Additionally, significant changes or uncertainties affecting micro- or macroeconomic climates may cause significant changes to our current expectations.

Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

O

ur common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "REG."  The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices and the cash dividends declared on our common stock by quarter for


and


.

We have determined that the dividends paid during


and


on our common stock qualify for the following tax treatment:

As of January 27,


, there were approximately 12,436 holders of common equity.

We intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to Regency Centers Corporation's common stockholders.  Future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon cash generated by operating activities, our financial condition, capital requirements, annual dividend requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant.  In order to maintain Regency Centers Corporation's qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are generally required to make annual distributions at least equal to 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year.  Under certain circumstances, which we do not expect to occur, we could be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distributions in order to meet such requirements.  We have a dividend reinvestment plan under which shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividends automatically in common stock.  Under the plan, we may elect to purchase common stock in the open market on behalf of shareholders or may issue new common stock to such shareholders.

Under the loan agreement of our line of credit, in the event of any monetary default, we may not make distributions to stockholders except to the extent necessary to maintain our REIT status.

There were no unregistered sales of equity securities, and we did not repurchase any of our equity securities during the quarter ended

December 31, 2014

.


The following table represents information with respect to purchases by the Parent Company of its common stock during the months in the three month period ended

See Exhibit 12.1 for additional information regarding the computations of ratio of earnings to fixed charges and ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preference dividends.

(3)

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized a gain on remeasurement of investment in real estate partnership of

$18.3 million

, which is included in

Total other expense (income)

and

Income from continuing operations

, upon the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in a single operating property, resulting in consolidation of the property as a business combination.  The gain on remeasurement was calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the previously held equity interest.

(4)

On January 1, 2014, the Company prospectively adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations.  Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations.  No property disposals in 2014 qualify as discontinued operations, therefore prior period amounts were not reclassified for 2014 property sales.


Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Regency Centers Corporation began its operations as a REIT in 1993 and is the managing general partner of Regency Centers, L.P.   All of our operating, investing, and financing activities are performed through the Operating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through its co-investment partnerships.  As of

December 31, 2014

, the Parent Company owned approximately

99.8%

of the outstanding common partnership units of the Operating Partnership.

As of

December 31, 2014

, we directly owned


Consolidated Properties located in


states representing

23.2 million

square feet of GLA.  Through co-investment partnerships, we own partial ownership interests in


Unconsolidated Properties located in


states and the District of Columbia representing

15.0 million

square feet of GLA.

We earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores, major retail anchors, restaurants, side-shop retailers, and service providers, as well as ground leasing or selling out-parcels to these same types of tenants.  We experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers.

We grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development.  We will continue to use our development capabilities, market presence, and anchor relationships to invest in value-added new developments and redevelopments of existing centers.  We fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including operating cash flow, property sales, equity offerings, new financing, and co-investment real estate partnerships.  Co-investment real estate partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions, developments, and redevelopments, as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management, property management, and other investing and financing services.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements.  The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period.  These accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical and expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards.  They are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates.  We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.

Accounts Receivable and Straight Line Rent

Minimum rent, percentage rent, and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are the Company's principal source of revenue.  As a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants.  We are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables.  To address the collectability of these receivables, we analyze historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve.  Although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.


Real Estate Investments

Acquisition of Real Estate Investments

Upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date.  Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities.  Fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  If, up to one year from the acquisition date, information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis.  The Company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred.

We strategically co-invest with partners to own, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop operating properties.  We analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated.  If it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities (“VIEs”), we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be VIEs, we do not have voting control, and/or the limited partners (or non-managing members) have substantive participatory rights, then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity.  Management uses its judgment when making these determinations.  We use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own 20% or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest, or if we own less than 20% of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence.  Under the equity method, we record our investments in and advances to these entities as investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets, and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.

Development of Real Estate Assets and Cost Capitalization

We capitalize the acquisition of land, the construction of buildings, and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in properties in development in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Other specifically identifiable development costs include pre-development costs essential to the development process, as well as, interest, real estate taxes, and direct employee costs incurred during the development period.  Once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy, these indirect costs are no longer capitalized.

•

Pre-development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits, legal, engineering, and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center.  If we determine it is probable that a specific project undergoing due diligence will not be developed, we immediately expense all related capitalized pre-development costs not considered recoverable.

•

Interest costs are capitalized to each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended.  We cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business.  During the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


, and


, we capitalized interest of

$7.1 million

,

$6.1 million

, and

$3.7 million

, respectively, on our development projects.

•

Real estate taxes are capitalized to each development project over the same period as we capitalize interest.

•

We have a staff of employees who directly support our development program.  All direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project.  The capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring.  During the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


, and


, we capitalized

$16.1 million

,

$11.7 million

, and

$10.3 million

, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program.

Valuation of Real Estate Investments

We evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  If such indicators occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate


disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction.  If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.  Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.

We evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators, including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired.  An investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an other-than-temporary basis. Cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors, such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors.  We consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary.  These factors include the age of the real estate partnerships, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks.  If we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, no impairment charge is recorded.  If our analysis indicates that there is an other-than-temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership, the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment.

The fair value of real estate investments is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods.  Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore are subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.

Derivative Instruments

The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage risks associated with changing interest rates. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company's borrowings.   For additional information on the Company’s use and accounting for derivatives, see Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company assesses effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity. Our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and LIBOR rate.  If a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.

The fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.

The following table summarizes general information related to the Unconsolidated Properties owned in co-investment partnerships in our shopping center portfolio (GLA in thousands):

(1)

Net of tenant concessions.

The following table summarizes pro-rata occupancy rates of our combined Consolidated and Unconsolidated shopping center portfolio:

Leasing activity was strong in


with pro-rata occupancy gains of 70 basis points driven primarily by new leasing in the less than 10,000 SqFT category, but also supported by high renewal activity of expiring leases in both categories as summarized in the leasing activity table below, and lower than historical move-out rates.  We believe our high-quality, grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated, desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants.  Improvements in the economy, combined with historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand, allow us to focus on merchandising of our centers to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers, which draws more retail customers to our centers.


The following table summarizes leasing activity for the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


, including our pro-rata share of activity within the portfolio of our co-investment partnerships:

(1)

Number of leasing transactions reported at 100%; all other statistics reported at pro-rata share.

(2)

Totals for base rent, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions reflect the weighted average per square foot ("PSF").

In the greater than or equal to 10,000 SqFT category, base rent PSF on new leases remained constant in 2014.  In the under 10,000 SqFT category for both new new leases and renewals, base rent PSF continued to increase on leases executed in 2014.

Significant Tenants and Concentrations of Risk

We seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property, market, or tenant.  The following table summarizes our three most significant tenants, each of which is a grocery tenant, occupying our shopping centers at

December 31, 2014

:

(1)

Includes stores owned by grocery anchors that are attached to our centers.

(2)

Includes our pro-rata share of Unconsolidated Properties and excludes those owned by anchors.


In January 2015, Safeway Inc. and AB Acquisition LLC (Albertsons) completed their proposed merger announced in March 2014.  In addition to the centers anchored by Safeway above, we have 12 shopping centers anchored by Albertsons, representing 1.4% of company owned GLA and 1.0% of annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis.  The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") is requiring that they divest 168 stores.  Of these, six are in our shopping centers and are under contract to be purchased by Haggen.

Bankruptcies

Although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy may have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. We monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers, especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition, business practice, and store closings in other locations.  We are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues, and no tenant represents more than 5% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis.

Our management team devotes significant time to monitoring consumer preferences, shopping behaviors, and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants. As a result of our findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our Parent Company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our Operating Partnership.  The Parent Company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional partnership units.  All debt is issued by our Operating Partnership or by our co-investment partnerships.  The following table represents the remaining available capacity under our at the market ("ATM") equity program and our unsecured credit facilities as of

December 31, 2014

(in thousands):

In January 2015, the Parent Company entered into an underwritten public offering for

2.875 million

shares of its common stock at a price of

$67.40

per share which will result in gross proceeds of approximately

$193.8 million

, before any underwriting discount and offering expenses.  In connection with this offering, the Parent Company entered into a forward sale agreement with an affiliate of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC for the underwritten shares.  The forward sale agreement will settle on one or more dates occurring no later than approximately 12 months after the date of the offering.

Net cash provided by operating activities

:

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by

$27.0 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2014

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2013

due to:

•

$27.9 million

increase in cash from operating income; offset by

•

$3.0 million

net decrease in cash due to timing of cash receipts and payments related to operating activities;

•

$2.6 million

decrease in operating cash flow distributions from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships due to liquidating three partnerships and reinvesting cash in another; and

•

$4.6 million

received upon settlement of the treasury hedges in May 2014 in connection with our bond issuance.

We operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our common and preferred stock and unit holders, which were

$194.0 million

and

$189.2 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively.  Our dividend distribution policy is set by our Board of Directors who monitor our financial position.  Our Board of Directors recently declared our common stock quarterly dividend of

$0.485

per share, payable on March 5,


.  Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability.  We plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

Net cash used in investing activities:

Net cash used in investing activities increased by

$200.5 million

due to lower real estate dispositions during


within our consolidated and unconsolidated portfolio coupled with a slight increase in acquisitions and development activity, which were funded from sales proceeds and financing activity.

Significant investing and divesting activities included:

•

We acquired four shopping centers in


, compared to three during


;

•

We sold

eleven

shopping centers and

six

out-parcels in


, compared to

twelve

shopping centers and

ten

out-parcels during


;

•

We received proceeds of

$27.4 million

upon the collection and sale of notes receivable in


;


•

We invested

$23.6 million

in our unconsolidated partnerships to acquire an operating property and to fund redevelopment activity during


.  In


, we invested

$10.9 million

primarily for mortgage maturities, one operating property acquisition, and redevelopment activity.

•

Distributions from our unconsolidated partnerships in


were primarily driven by real estate sales proceeds of $32.1 million and $5.1 million from refinancing a loan.  Distributions in


were primarily from real estate sales proceeds of $32.7 million, $6.9 million net proceeds from debt refinancing, and $47.5 million distributions upon redemption of preferred interest.

•

Acquisition of securities and proceeds from sale of securities include investments in equity securities.  In


, we paid $14.3 million for the acquisition of AmREIT, Inc. ("AmREIT") common stock, and received $22.1 million in proceeds upon the subsequent sale. The remaining securities investing activity, during both


and


, primarily relates to our deferred compensation plan.

We plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for long-term investment purposes and have a staff of employees who directly support our development and redevelopment program.  Internal costs attributable to these development and redevelopment activities are capitalized as part of each project.  During


, we paid

$238.2 million

for the development, redevelopment, and improvement of our real estate properties as comprised of the following (in thousands):

•

During


we acquired

six

land parcels for new development projects as compared to five in


.

•

Building and tenant improvements decreased

$7.4 million

during the

year ended December 31, 2014

primarily related to timing of capital projects and renovations.

•

The

$28.9 million

increase in redevelopment costs were due to an increase in the number and magnitude of redevelopments, primarily driven by our Westlake and Westchester redevelopment projects.

•

The

$6.3 million

decrease in our development projects expenditures was due to the size of and progress on developments.  See the tables below for a detail of current and recently completed development projects.

•

Capitalized direct compensation represents overhead costs of our development and construction team directly related to the development projects, with the majority of capitalizable direct compensation costs incurred at or near inception of a development project.  The increased number and size of projects starting in


as compared to


resulted in the increase in capitalized compensation costs.  During


we started $239.2 million of development and redevelopment projects as compared to $194.3 million in


.  Changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development and redevelopment projects that may be capitalized.  A 10% reduction in development and redevelopment activity without a corresponding reduction in the compensation costs directly related to our development and redevelopment activities could result in an additional charge to net income of approximately $1.6 million.


As of

December 31, 2014

, we had

seven

development projects that were either under construction or in lease up, compared to

six

such development projects as of

Net cash used in financing activities

:

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by

$148.2 million

primarily due to proceeds from the net issuance of unsecured notes in


and net repayments on the credit facilities in


.  The following table presents changes in our primary categories of financing activity:


Significant financing activities during the year ended

December 31, 2014

include:

•

During


, the Parent Company issued approximately 1.7 million shares of common stock through our ATM program at an average price of

$60.00

per share, as compared to 1.9 million shares at

$53.35

per share in


.  In both years, the proceeds were used to fund investment activities.

•

The

$6.8 million

change in net distributions to limited partners is primarily related to 2014 distribution of proceeds from sales and debt financing.

•

During


we increased our dividend distribution rates on our common stock and operating partnership units.

•

During


, we paid down our Line and Term Loan

$95.0 million

, net.

•

The

$222.6 million

net change in debt issuance is primarily related to the $250 million of new 3.75% ten-year unsecured public debt issued in May 2014, which matures in June 2024.  In connection with the bond offering, we settled the previously locked forward starting interest rate swaps, receiving net cash proceeds of $4.6 million.  These proceeds will offset bond interest expense over the life of the bonds, resulting in a lower effective interest rate of 3.59%.

•

The

$160.1 million

net change in debt repayment is primarily driven by the repayment of $150 million of 4.95% ten-year unsecured public debt at maturity. in April 2014.

We endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets.  As of

December 31, 2014

, 76.8% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered.  Such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain significant availability on the Line.  Our coverage ratio, including our pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 2.5 times for the year ended

December 31, 2014

, as compared to 2.4 times for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.  We define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest, taxes, investment transaction profits net of deal costs, depreciation and amortization (“Core EBITDA”) divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders.

Through


, we estimate that we will require approximately $622.7 million of cash, including $179.2 million to complete in-process developments and redevelopments, $426.2 million to repay maturing debt, and approximately $17.3 to fund our pro-rata share of estimated capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships for repayment of debt.  If we start new developments or redevelop additional shopping centers, our cash requirements will increase.  If we refinance maturing debt, our cash requirements will decrease.  To meet our cash requirements, we will utilize cash generated from operations, borrowings from our Line and Term Loan, proceeds from the sale of real estate, cash receipts from our forward equity offering, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity and the issuance of debt.

We have $350.0 million of fixed rate, unsecured debt maturing in August 2015 and $400.0 million of fixed rate, unsecured debt maturing in June 2017.  In order to mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility, we previously entered into $220.0 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in 2015 and an additional $220.0 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in 2017.  These interest rate swaps lock in the 10-year treasury rate and swap spread at a weighted average fixed rate of 2.67% and 3.48%, respectively.  A current market based credit spread applicable to Regency will be added to the locked in fixed rate at time of issuance that will determine the final bond yield.  We will cash settle these forward starting interest rate swaps when we issue the new debt.  The actual cash settlement may differ from the current fair value of these interest rate swaps based on movements in interest rates.

We continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments. Based upon the current capital markets, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings, we currently expect that we will successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund our obligations, as needed.

Our Line, Term Loan, and unsecured loans require we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We are in compliance with these covenants at

December 31, 2014

and expect to remain in compliance.


Investments in Real Estate Partnerships

As of

December 31, 2014

and


, we had investments in real estate partnerships of

$333.2 million

and

$358.8 million

, respectively, as discussed further in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following table is a summary of unconsolidated combined assets and liabilities of these co-investment partnerships and our pro-rata share as of

December 31, 2014

and


(dollars in thousands):

(1)

Pro-rata financial information is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with GAAP.  However, management believes that providing such information is useful to investors in assessing the impact of its investments in real estate partnership activities on our operations, which includes such items on a single line presentation under the equity method in its consolidated financial statements.

(2)

The difference between our share of the net assets of the co-investment partnerships and our investments in real estate partnerships per the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets relates primarily to differences in inside/outside basis as further described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In  addition to earning our pro-rata share of net income or loss in each of these co-investment partnerships, we receive fees, as shown below, for each of the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


, and


(dollars in thousands):


Contractual Obligations

We have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans, unsecured notes, unsecured credit facilities and interest rate swap obligations as described further below and in Note 9 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center.  In addition, we have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business.

The following table of Contractual Obligations summarizes our debt maturities, including our pro-rata share of obligations within co-investment partnerships, (in thousands) as of

December 31, 2014

, and excludes the following:

•

Recorded debt premiums or discounts that are not obligations;

•

Obligations related to construction or development contracts, since payments are only due upon satisfactory performance under the contracts;

•

Letters of credit of

$5.9 million

issued to cover performance obligations on certain development projects, which will be satisfied upon completion of the development projects; and,

•

Obligations for retirement savings plans due to uncertainty around timing of participant withdrawals, which are solely within the control of the participant, and are further discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1)

Includes interest payments.

(2)

We are obligated to contribute our pro-rata share to fund maturities if they are not refinanced.  We believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements.  In the event that a co-investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co-investment partnership, we would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our co-investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities, not previously discussed.  Our co-investment partnership properties have been financed with non-recourse loans.  We have no guarantees related to these loans.

Results from Operations

Comparison of the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


:

Our revenues increased in


, as compared to


, as summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Minimum rent increased as follows:

•

$29.1 million increase due to the acquisitions of operating properties and operations beginning at development properties;

•

$9.9 million increase in minimum rent from same properties, which was driven by rental rate and occupancy growth and increases from contractual rent steps in existing leases.  Same property includes operating properties owned for the entirety of both periods being presented;

•

These increases were offset by a $2.2 decrease from operating properties sold in


that no longer are reported as discontinued operations.

Recoveries from tenants and other income represent reimbursements from tenants for their pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers, as well as other income earned at our operating properties.  Increases are due to the following:

•

$6.9 million increase due to the acquisition of operating properties and operations beginning at development properties during


and


; and,

•

$6.2 million increase in recoveries at same properties, which was driven by an increase in occupancy and by an increase in recoverable costs, and $1.4 million increase in other income primarily related to settlements and termination fees;

•

Offset by a $1.4 million decrease from operating properties sold in 2014 that no longer are reported as discontinued operations.

We earned fees, at market-based rates, for asset management, property management, leasing, acquisition, and financing services that we provided to our co-investment partnerships and third parties as follows (in thousands):

Asset and property management fees decreased due to the liquidation of one unconsolidated real estate partnership consisting of nine properties during the third quarter of 2013, partially offset by higher asset and property management fees from our other partnerships.


Our operating expenses increased in


, as compared to


, as summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Depreciation and amortization increased

$17.2 million

.  The increase is largely attributable to the following:  $9.9 million from acquisitions, $5.5 million from new development operations and $2.6 million at same properties due to redevelopments and capital improvements, offset by a decrease of approximately $800,000 from disposals.

Operating and maintenance increased

$6.8 million

.  The increase relates to the following:  $2.0 million from acquisitions, $2.6 million from new development operations, and $2.4 million at same property driven by an increase in snow removal costs, offset by approximately $200,000 from sold properties.

General and administrative expenses decreased approximately

$1.0 million

largely due to greater capitalization of development overhead costs by $4.4 million, stemming from higher volume of development projects, offset by an increase of $4.6 million of higher incentive compensation expense during 2014.   Additionally, changes in participant obligations within the deferred compensation plan resulted in a $1.9 million decrease in expense.

Real estate taxes increased

$5.3 million

.  The increase largely consists of the following: $2.6 million from acquisitions, $1.6 million from new development operations, and $1.4 million at same properties from higher assessed values, partially offset by approximately $300,000 from sold properties.

The following table presents the components of other expense (income) (in thousands):

See table below for a discussion of interest expense.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we recognized a $175,000 impairment on two parcels of land held and $1.1 million of loss on the disposal of one operating property and one land parcel.  During the year ended

December 31, 2013

, we recognized a

$6.0 million

impairment on a single operating property.

Net investment income increased

$6.2 million

, largely driven by an $8.1 million gain realized on the sale of available for sale securities offset by a $1.9 million decrease in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we acquired the remaining

50%

interest and gained control of a previously unconsolidated investment in real estate partnership that owns a single operating property.  As the operating property constitutes a business, acquisition of control was accounted for as a step acquisition, and the net assets acquired were recognized at fair value.  The gain of

$18.3 million

was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the Company's previously held equity interest, using an income approach to measure fair value.


The following table presents the change in net interest expense (in thousands):

Our total interest expense increased mainly due to the $77.8 million of mortgage debt assumed with the Fairfield Portfolio acquisition in the first quarter of 2014.

Our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships increased in


, as compared to


, as follows (in thousands):

The decrease in our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships is principally due to the following:

•

$947,000 of pro-rata gains on one operating property disposed of within GRIR.

•

$1.0 million decrease within Columbia II due to $424,000 of pro-rata impairment losses recognized upon sale of two properties in 2014 and $830,000 of gains recognized in 2013 on the sale of 4 operating properties and one land parcel;

•

$654,000 of pro-rata gains on one operating property disposed of within RegCal in 2014;

•

The Fund sold all its operating properties in August 2013 for pro-rata gains of $7.4 million.  The only activity in 2014 was collection of remaining receivables and the final distribution;

•

$4.5 million

decrease from liquidating our ownership interest in BRET in October 2013; and,

•

$11.2 million

increase within our Other investment partnerships driven by the 2014 gains on sale of two land parcels and two operating properties.


The following represents the remaining components that comprised net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders for the year ended

December 31, 2014

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2013

, (in thousands):

A $1.0 million tax benefit was recognized in 2014 upon the receipt of a state tax refund from amending our prior tax returns. We recognized $55.1 million of gains on sale of real estate, net of taxes, in 2014 attributable to the sale of eleven operating properties and six land parcels.

Comparison of the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


:

Our revenues increased as summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Minimum rent increased as follows:

•

$22.5 million increase due to the acquisitions of operating properties and operations beginning at development properties; and

•

$8.2 million increase in minimum rent from same properties, which was driven by rental rate and occupancy growth and increases from contractual rent steps in existing leases.  Same property includes operating properties owned for the entirety of both periods being presented.

•

These increases were offset by a $17.8 million decrease due to the sale of a 15-property portfolio in July 2012 not considered discontinued operations.

Recoveries from tenants and other income represent reimbursements from tenants for their pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers, as well as other income earned at our operating properties. Increases are due to the following:

•

$4.7 million increase due to the acquisition of operating properties and operations beginning at development properties during


and


; and

•

$6.1 million increase in recoveries at same properties, which was driven primarily by an increase in occupancy and an increase in recoverable costs.


•

These increases were offset by a $5.1 million decrease due to the sale of a 15-property portfolio in July 2012 not considered discontinued operations.

Other income decreased by $2.2 million as a result of final distributions from our terminated third party managed captive insurance program and establishing a consolidated captive insurance subsidiary during 2012.

We earned fees, at market-based rates, for asset management, property management, leasing, acquisition, disposition and financing services that we provided to our co-investment partnerships and third parties as follows (in thousands):

Asset and property management fees decreased approximately $815,000 due to the liquidation of two unconsolidated real estate partnerships during 2013, resulting in $1.1 million reduction in asset and property management fees, partially offset by higher asset and property management fees from our other partnerships.  Leasing commissions and other fees decreased during 2013, as compared to 2012, due to the two liquidations discussed above and a decrease in leasing activities performed for co-investment partnerships and third parties during 2013, as occupancy levels stabilize and less vacant GLA was available for lease.

Our operating expenses increased as summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Depreciation and amortization increased

$11.6 million

.  The increase is largely attributable to the following:  $8.3 million from acquisitions, $6.5 million at same properties, and $4.7 million from new development operations, offset by $7.5 million decrease from the sale of a 15 property portfolio in July 2012 not considered discontinued operations.

Operating and maintenance increased

$4.3 million

.  The increase substantially relates to the following:  $4.0 million from acquisitions, $1.6 million from new development operations, and $3.0 million at same properties, offset by $4.3 million from the sale of a 15 property portfolio in July 2012 not considered discontinued operations.

General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $466,000 largely due to greater capitalization of development overhead costs of approximately $1.4 million, due to higher volume of development projects, offset by a decrease in capitalization of leasing overhead costs of $1.2 million as occupancy levels stabilize and less vacant GLA was available to lease.  The net change in compensation and other overhead costs resulted in additional savings of approximately $200,000.

Real estate taxes increased approximately

$815,000

.  The increase largely consists of the following: $2.4 million from acquisitions and new development operations, $1.3 million at same properties from higher assessed values, offset by $2.9 million from the sale of a 15 property portfolio in July 2012 not considered discontinued operations.

Other operating expenses increased approximately

$892,000

primarily due to an increase in environmental remediation reserves, offset by decreases in bad debt expense and acquisition and pursuit costs.


The following table presents the components of other expense (income) (in thousands):

See table below for a discussion of interest expense.

During the year ended

December 31, 2013

, we recognized a $6.0 million impairment on a single operating property. During the year ended

December 31, 2012

, we recognized total impairments of $20.3 million, including $18.1 million related to the 15-property portfolio sold in July 2012, and $2.2 million related to three land parcels.

During 2013, we repaid two mortgages early with minimal remaining unamortized loan costs.  On July 20, 2012, we repaid $150.0 million of our Term Loan, and as a result of this early extinguishment of debt, we expensed approximately $852,000 in remaining unamortized loan costs.

The

$1.2 million

increase in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets from

December 31, 2012

to

December 31, 2013

and is consistent with the change in plan liabilities, included in general and administrative expenses above.

The following table presents the change in interest expense (in thousands):

Our interest expense decreased primarily due to paying down our unsecured credit facilities and mortgages, coupled with greater interest capitalization on development projects, driven by the increase in cumulative development project costs over the prior year.


Our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships increased in


, as compared to


, as follows (in thousands):

The increase in our equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is principally due to the following:

•

$3.5 million

increase from the GRIR partnership due to various factors, including: increased tenant percentage rent, recovery revenue rates, and settlement proceeds; coupled with lower interest expense as a result of paying off debt in 2012 and the loss on debt extinguishment and provision for impairment in 2012 that did not occur in 2013.  These increases are offset by higher depreciation expense from redevelopments.

•

$6.8 million

decrease from the Columbia I partnership primarily due to our $6.9 million pro-rata gain on sale of an operating property that was sold in April 2012,

•

$7.5 million

increase from the Fund due to recognizing $7.4 million pro-rata gain on the sale of all operating properties within the Fund in August 2013, and

•

$2.3 million

increase from our ownership interest retained in BRET, as part of the 15-property portfolio sale completed in July 2012, which we redeemed 100% of our ownership interest for cash in October 2013.


The following represents the remaining components that comprised net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, as compared to the year ended

December 31, 2012

, (in thousands):

The decrease in income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiary is due to the large expense recognized during 2012 as a full valuation allowance was established on the balance of our deferred tax assets.

Income from discontinued operations of $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $58.0 million in gains, net of taxes, from the sale of twelve properties and the operations of the shopping centers sold.  Loss from discontinued operations of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 included the operations of the shopping centers sold during 2012 and 2013, and $21.9 million in gains, net of taxes, from the sale of five properties; offset by $54.5 million of impairment losses.

The decrease in preferred stock dividends is attributable to the $9.3 million non-cash charges recognized during 2012 upon redemption of the Series 3, 4 and 5 Preferred Stock.


Supplemental Earnings Information

We use certain non-GAAP performance measures, in addition to the required GAAP presentations, as we believe these measures are beneficial to us in improving the understanding of our operational results among the investing public.  We believe such measures make comparisons of other REITs' operating results to ours more meaningful.  We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.

The following are our definitions of Same Property Net Operating Income ("NOI"), Funds from Operations ("FFO"), and Core FFO, which we believe to be beneficial non-GAAP performance measures used in understanding our operational results:

Ÿ

NOI

is calculated as total property revenues (minimum rent, percentage rents, and recoveries from tenants and other income) less direct property operating expenses (operating and maintenance and real estate taxes) from the properties owned by us, and excludes corporate-level income (including management, transaction, and other fees), for the entirety of the periods presented.  NOI excludes straight-line rental income, net of reserves, above and below market rent amortization, banking charges, and other fees

•

Pro-Rata

information includes 100% of our consolidated properties plus our ownership interest in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships.

•

Sa

me Property

information is provided for operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared and excludes all Properties in Development and Non-Same Properties.  A Non-Same Property is a property acquired during either period being compared, a development completion that is less than 90% funded and 95% leased or features less than two years of anchor operations.  Same Property also excludes projects in development, which represent projects owned and intended to be developed, including partially operating properties acquired specifically for redevelopment and excluding land held for future development.  See note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for an expanded definition of properties in development.

•

Same Property NOI

includes NOI for Same Property, which is a key measure used by management in evaluating the performance of our properties.

•

FFO

is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable property, net of tax, excluding operating real estate impairments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We compute FFO for all periods presented in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Many companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions. Since FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions, and impairments, it can provide a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore, should not be considered an alternative for cash flow as a measure of liquidity.

•

Core FFO

is an additional performance measure used by Regency as the computation of FFO includes certain non-cash and non-comparable items that affect the Company's period-over-period performance.  Core FFO excludes from FFO, but is not limited to: (a) transaction related gains, income or expense; (b) impairments on land; (c) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; and (d) other non-core amounts as they occur.  The Company provides a reconciliation of FFO to Core FFO below.

$13.0 million

, driven by $5.1 million increase in contractual rent steps and $7.9 million increase in rental rate growth and changes in occupancy.


Pro-rata same property recovery revenue increased

$7.5 million

due to greater recovery rates driven by market rates and occupancy improvements, as well as increases in recoverable costs.

Pro-rata same property operating expenses increased

$5.5 million

due to increases in real estate tax assessments and increased common area expenses primarily related to snow removal costs associated with the inclement winter weather in 2014.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks.  We believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations.  Generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems.  Where available, we have applied and been accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs.  We have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination.  We have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk.  We monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites.  We also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.

As of

December 31, 2014

we had accrued liabilities of

$10.2 million

for our pro-rata share of environmental remediation.  We believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations; however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.

Inflation/Deflation

Inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, inflation may become a greater concern in the future.  Substantially all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.  Most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.  In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates.  However, during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness, minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines.  Occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market Risk

We are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk:

•

We have an

$800.0 million

Line commitment and a

$165.0 million

Term Loan commitment, as further described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our Line commitment has a variable interest rate that is based upon an annual rate of

LIBOR plus 117.5 basis points

and our Term Loan has a variable rate of

LIBOR plus 115 basis points

and both are subject to a fee on the undrawn balances.  LIBOR rates charged on our Line and Term Loan (collectively our "unsecured credit facilities") change monthly.  The spread on the unsecured credit facilities is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings.  If our credit ratings are downgraded, the spread on the unsecured credit facilities would increase, resulting in higher interest costs.

•

We are also exposed to changes in interest rates when we refinance our existing long-term fixed rate debt.  The objective of our interest rate risk management program is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs.  To achieve these objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument.  We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.  Our interest rate swaps are structured solely for the purpose of interest rate protection.

We have

$350.0 million

and

$400.0 million

of fixed rate, unsecured debt maturing in August


and June


, respectively.  In order to mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility, we previously entered into $220.0 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in


and an additional $220.0 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in


.  These interest rate swaps lock in the 10-year treasury rate and swap spread at a weighted average fixed rate of 2.67%


and 3.48%, respectively.  A current market based credit spread applicable to Regency will be added to the locked in fixed rate at time of issuance that will determine the final bond yield.

We continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments.  Based upon the current capital markets, our current credit ratings, our current capacity under our unsecured credit facilities, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings, we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques.  The table below presents the principal cash flows, weighted average interest rates of remaining debt, and the fair value of total debt as of

December 31, 2014

(dollars in thousands).  The table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes.  Although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table, those rates represent rates that existed as of

December 31, 2014

and are subject to change on a monthly basis.  Further, the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of

December 31, 2014

and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date.  Since firm commitments are not presented, the table has limited predictive value.  As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time, and actual interest rates.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Regency Centers Corporation:

We have audited Regency Centers Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Regency Centers Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Regency Centers Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Regency Centers Corporation and subsidiaries as of

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Unit Holders of Regency Centers, L.P. and

the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Regency Centers Corporation:

We have audited Regency Centers, L.P.'s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Regency Centers, L.P.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Regency Centers, L.P. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Regency Centers, L.P. and subsidiaries as of

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)    Organization and Principles of Consolidation

General

Regency Centers Corporation (the “Parent Company”) began its operations as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) in


and is the general partner of Regency Centers, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”).  The Parent Company engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, and development of retail shopping centers through the Operating Partnership, and has no other assets or liabilities other than through its investment in the Operating Partnership.  As of

December 31, 2014

, the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (the "Company” or “Regency”) directly owned


retail shopping centers and held partial interests in an additional


retail shopping centers through investments in real estate partnerships (also referred to as "joint ventures" or "co-investment partnerships").

Estimates, Risks, and Uncertainties

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The most significant estimates in the Company's financial statements relate to the carrying values of its investments in real estate, including its shopping centers, properties in development, and its investments in real estate partnerships, and accounts receivable, net. It is possible that the estimates and assumptions that have been utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements could change significantly if economic conditions were to weaken.

Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and consolidated partnerships in which the Company has a controlling interest.  Investments in real estate partnerships not controlled by the Company are accounted for under the equity method.  All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Ownership of the Parent Company

The Parent Company has a single class of common stock outstanding and two series of preferred stock outstanding (“Series 6 and 7 Preferred Stock”).  The dividends on the Series 6 and 7 Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable in arrears quarterly.

Ownership of the Operating Partnership

The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units.  As of

December 31, 2014

, the Parent Company owned approximately

99.8%

or

94,108,061

of the

94,262,231

outstanding common Partnership Units of the Operating Partnership.  Net income and distributions of the Operating Partnership are allocable to the general and limited common Partnership Units in accordance with their ownership percentages.

Investments in Real Estate Partnerships

Investments in real estate partnerships not controlled by the Company are accounted for under the equity method.  The accounting policies of the real estate partnerships are similar to the Company's accounting policies.  Income or loss from these real estate partnerships, which includes all operating results (including impairment losses) and gains on sales of properties within the joint ventures, is allocated to the Company in accordance with the respective partnership agreements.  Such allocations of net income or loss are recorded in


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2014

equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The net difference in the carrying amount of investments in real estate partnerships and the underlying equity in net assets is either accreted to income and recorded in equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations over the expected useful lives of the properties and other intangible assets, which range in lives from


to


years, or recognized at liquidation if the joint venture agreement includes a unilateral right to elect to dissolve the real estate partnership and, upon such an election, receive a distribution in-kind, as discussed further below.

Cash distributions of earnings from operations from investments in real estate partnerships are presented in cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash distributions from the sale of a property or loan proceeds received from the placement of debt on a property included in investments in real estate partnerships are presented in cash flows provided by investing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The Company evaluates the structure and the substance of its investments in the real estate partnerships to determine if they are variable interest entities.  The Company has concluded that these partnership investments are not variable interest entities.  Further, the joint venture partners in the real estate partnerships have significant ownership rights, including approval over operating budgets and strategic plans, capital spending, sale or financing, and admission of new partners.  Upon formation of the joint ventures, the Company, through the Operating Partnership, also became the managing member, responsible for the day-to-day operations of the real estate partnerships.  In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, the Company evaluated its investment in each real estate partnership and concluded that the other partners have kick-out rights and/or substantive participating rights and, therefore, the Company has concluded that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for these investments and they do not require consolidation.  Under the equity method of accounting, investments in real estate partnerships are initially recorded at cost, subsequently increased for additional contributions and allocations of income, and reduced for distributions received and allocations of loss.  These investments are included in the consolidated financial statements as investments in real estate partnerships.

Noncontrolling Interests

The Company consolidates all entities in which it has a controlling ownership interest.  A controlling ownership interest is typically attributable to the entity with a majority voting interest.  Noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity, in a subsidiary or consolidated entity, not attributable, directly or indirectly to the Company.  Such noncontrolling interests are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within equity or capital, but separately from stockholders' equity or partners' capital.  On the Consolidated Statements of Operations, all of the revenues and expenses from less-than-wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries are reported in net income, including both the amounts attributable to the Company and noncontrolling interests.  The amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the Company and to the noncontrolling interests are clearly identified on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Noncontrolling Interests of the Parent Company

The consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company include the following ownership interests held by owners other than the preferred and common stockholders of the Parent Company: (i) the limited Partnership Units in the Operating Partnership held by third parties (“Exchangeable operating partnership units”) and (ii) the minority-owned interest held by third parties in consolidated partnerships (“Limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships”).  The Parent Company has included all of these noncontrolling interests in permanent equity, separate from the Parent Company's stockholders' equity, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The portion of net income or comprehensive income attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in net income and comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) of the Parent Company.

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 480, securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets at the option of the holder, not solely within the control of the issuer, are classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests outside of permanent equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Parent Company has evaluated the conditions as specified under the FASB ASC Topic 480 as it relates to exchangeable operating partnership units outstanding and concluded that it has the right to satisfy the redemption requirements of the units by


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2014

delivering unregistered common stock.  Each outstanding exchangeable operating partnership unit is exchangeable for one share of common stock of the Parent Company, and the unit holder cannot require redemption in cash or other assets.  Limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships are not redeemable by the holders.  The Parent Company also evaluated its fiduciary duties to itself, its shareholders, and, as the managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, to the Operating Partnership, and concluded its fiduciary duties are not in conflict with each other or the underlying agreements.  Therefore, the Parent Company classifies such units and interests as permanent equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity.

Noncontrolling Interests of the Operating Partnership

The Operating Partnership has determined that limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships are noncontrolling interests.  The Operating Partnership has included these noncontrolling interests in permanent capital, separate from partners' capital, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Capital.  The portion of net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in net income and comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements Comprehensive Income (Loss) of the Operating Partnership.

(b)    Revenues and Accounts Receivable

Leasing Revenue and Receivables

The Company leases space to tenants under agreements with varying terms.  Leases are accounted for as operating leases with minimum rent recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease regardless of when payments are due.  The Company estimates the collectibility of the accounts receivable related to base rents, straight-line rents, expense reimbursements, and other revenue taking into consideration the Company's historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and remaining lease terms

.

The Company recorded the following provisions for doubtful accounts (in thousands):

The following table represents the components of accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):

Substantially all of the lease agreements with anchor tenants contain provisions that provide for additional rents based on tenants' sales volume ("percentage rent").  Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements.  Substantially all lease agreements contain provisions for reimbursement of the tenants' share of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance (“CAM”) costs.  Recovery of real estate taxes, insurance, and CAM costs are recognized as the respective costs are incurred in accordance with the lease agreements.


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2014

As part of the leasing process, the Company may provide the lessee with an allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements.  These leasehold improvements are capitalized and recorded as tenant improvements, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the remaining lease term.  If the allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event the Company is not considered the owner of the improvements, the allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease term as a reduction of minimum rent.  Factors considered during this evaluation include, among other things, who holds legal title to the improvements as well as other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement and provisions for substantiation of such costs (e.g. unilateral control of the tenant space during the build-out process).  Determination of the appropriate accounting for the payment of a tenant allowance is made on a lease-by-lease basis, considering the facts and circumstances of the individual tenant lease.  When the Company is the owner of the leasehold improvements, recognition of lease revenue commences when the lessee is given possession of the leased space upon completion of tenant improvements.  However, when the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant, the lease inception date is the date the tenant obtains possession of the leased space for purposes of constructing its leasehold improvements.

Real Estate Sales

Profits from sales of real estate are recognized under the full accrual method by the Company when: (i) a sale is consummated; (ii) the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property; (iii) the Company's receivable, if applicable, is not subject to future subordination; (iv) the Company has transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership; and (v) the Company does not have substantial continuing involvement with the property.

The Company sells shopping centers to joint ventures in exchange for cash equal to the fair value of the ownership interest of its partners.  The Company accounts for those sales as “partial sales” and recognizes gains on those partial sales in the period the properties were sold to the extent of the percentage interest sold, and in the case of certain real estate partnerships, applies a more restrictive method of recognizing gains, as discussed further below.

As of

December 31, 2014

,

five

of the Company's joint ventures (“DIK-JV”) give each partner the unilateral right to elect to dissolve the real estate partnership and, upon such an election, receive a distribution in-kind (“DIK”) of the assets of the real estate partnership equal to their respective capital account, which could include properties the Company previously sold to the real estate partnership.

Because the contingency associated with the possibility of receiving a particular property back upon liquidation is not satisfied at the property level, but at the aggregate level, no deferred gain is recognized on an individual property sold by the DIK-JV to a third party or received by the Company upon actual dissolution.  Instead, the property received upon dissolution is recorded at the carrying value of the Company's investment in the DIK-JV on the date of dissolution.  However, the deferred gain is recognized if and when all such properties in the DIK-JV are sold to a third party.

Management Services

The Company is engaged under agreements with its joint venture partners to provide asset management, property management, leasing, investing, and financing services for such joint ventures' shopping centers. The fees are market-based, generally calculated as a percentage of either revenues earned or the estimated values of the properties managed or the proceeds received, and are recognized as services are rendered, when fees due are determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.  The Company also receives transaction fees, as contractually agreed upon with a joint venture, which include fees such as acquisition fees, disposition fees, “promotes”, or “earnouts”, which are recognized as services are rendered, when fees due are determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

(c)    Real Estate Investments

Capitalization and Depreciation

Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the respective assets are recorded in operating and maintenance expense.  The Company does not have a capitalization threshold.

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of approximately


years for buildings and improvements, the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term subject to a maximum of


years for tenant improvements, and

three

to

seven

years for furniture and equipment.

Development Costs

Land, buildings, and improvements are recorded at cost.  All specifically identifiable costs related to development activities are capitalized into properties in development on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Properties in development are defined as properties that are in the construction or initial lease-up phase.  Once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy, costs are no longer capitalized.  The capitalized costs include pre-development costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, and allocated direct employee costs incurred during the period of development.  Interest costs are capitalized into each development project based upon applying the Company's weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended.  The Company discontinues interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would the Company capitalize interest on the project beyond


months after substantial completion of the building shell.

The following table represents the components of properties in development in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):

Construction in process represents developments where the Company (i) has not yet incurred at least

90%

of the expected costs to complete and is less than

95%

leased, and (ii) percent leased is less than

90%

and the project features less than

one

year of anchor tenant operations, and (iii) the anchor tenant has been open for less than

two

calendar years, and (iv) less than

three

years have passed since the start of construction.

Land held for future development represents projects not in construction, but identified and available for future development when the market demand for a new shopping center exists.

Pre-development costs represent the costs the Company incurs prior to land acquisition including contract deposits, as well as legal, engineering, and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center.  As of

December 31, 2014

and


, the Company had refundable deposits of approximately

$375,000

and

$680,000

, respectively, included in pre-development costs.  If the Company determines that the development of a particular shopping center is no longer probable, any related pre-development costs previously capitalized are immediately expensed.  During the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


, and


, the Company expensed pre-development costs of approximately

$2.3 million

,

$528,000

, and

$1.5 million

, respectively, in other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Acquisitions

The Company and the real estate partnerships account for business combinations using the acquisition method by recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values.  The Company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred.

The Company's methodology includes estimating an “as-if vacant” fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements.  In addition, the Company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases.

The value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period. The value of in-place leases is recorded to amortization expense over the remaining initial term of the respective leases.

Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.  The value of above-market leases is amortized as a reduction of minimum rent over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of below-market leases is accreted to minimum rent over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.  The Company does not assign value to customer relationship intangibles if it has pre-existing business relationships with the major retailers at the acquired property since they do not provide incremental value over the Company's existing relationships.

Held for Sale

The Company classifies an operating property or a property in development as held-for-sale upon satisfaction of the following criteria: (i) management commits to a plan to sell a property (or group of properties), (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such properties, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the property have been initiated, (iv) the sale of the property is probable and transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year, (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and (vi) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.

The Company generally considers assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by the appropriate level of management and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale such that the sale of the property within one year is considered probable.  It is not unusual for real estate sales contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract. In addition, certain other matters critical to the final sale, such as financing arrangements, often remain pending even upon contract acceptance.  As a result, properties under contract may not close within the expected time period, or may not close at all.  The Company must make a determination as to the point in time that it is probable that a sale will be consummated.  Generally this occurs when a sales contract is executed with no contingencies and the prospective buyer has significant funds at risk to ensure performance.

Operating properties held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.  The recording of depreciation and amortization expense is suspended during the held-for-sale period.  If circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and, as a result, the Company decides not to sell a property previously classified as held-for-sale, the property is reclassified as held and used and is measured individually at the lower of its (i) carrying amount before the property was classified as held-for-sale, adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used or (ii) the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.  The Company evaluated its property portfolio and


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2014

did not identify any properties that would meet the above mentioned criteria for held-for-sale as of

December 31, 2014

and


.

Discontinued Operations

On January 1, 2014, the Company prospectively adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, and all sales will be recorded in accordance with the ASU.  The amendments in the ASU change the requirements for reporting discontinued operations.  Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations.  Those strategic shifts should have a major effect on the organization's operations and financial results.  In addition, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations.

Prior to January 1, 2014, when the Company sold a property or classified a property as held-for-sale and would not have significant continuing involvement in the operation of the property, the operations of the property were eliminated from ongoing operations and classified in discontinued operations.  Its operations, including any mortgage interest and gain on sale, were reported in discontinued operations so that the operations were clearly distinguished.  Prior periods were also reclassified to reflect the operations of the property as discontinued operations.  When the Company sold an operating property to a joint venture or to a third party, and would continue to manage the property, the operations and gain on sale were included in income from continuing operations.

Impairment

We evaluate whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  Through the evaluation, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results.  Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.  To the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.  If such indicators are not identified, management will not assess the recoverability of a property's carrying value.  If  a property previously classified as held and used is changed to held-for-sale, the Company estimates fair value, less expected costs to sell, which could cause the Company to determine that the property is impaired.

The fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach.  Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore is subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, the Company generally uses market data and comparable sales information.

A loss in value of investments in real estate partnerships under the equity method of accounting, other than a temporary decline, must be recognized in the period in which the loss occurs.  If management identifies indicators that the value of the Company's investment in real estate partnerships may be impaired, it evaluates the investment by calculating the fair value of the investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected term of the investment.


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2014

The Company established the following provisions for impairment (in thousands):

Tax Basis

The net tax basis of the Company's real estate assets exceeds the book basis by approximately

$129.7 million

and

$156.8 million

at

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively, primarily due to the property impairments recorded for book purposes and the cost basis of the assets acquired and their carryover basis recorded for tax purposes.

(d)    Cash and Cash Equivalents

Any instruments which have an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents.  As of

December 31, 2014

and


,

$8.0 million

and

$9.5 million

, respectively, of cash was restricted through escrow agreements and certain mortgage loans.

(e)    Securities

The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date.  Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.  Marketable securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings.  Debt and marketable equity securities not classified as held to maturity or as trading, are classified as available-for-sale, and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in the determination of comprehensive income and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.  The fair value of securities is determined using quoted market prices.

(f)    Deferred Costs

Deferred costs include leasing costs and loan costs, net of accumulated amortization.  Such costs are amortized over the periods through lease expiration or loan maturity, respectively.  If the lease is terminated early, or if the loan is repaid prior to maturity, the remaining leasing costs or loan costs are written off.  Deferred leasing costs consist of internal and external commissions associated with leasing the Company's shopping centers.  The following table represents the components of deferred costs, net of accumulated amortization, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):

(1)

Consist of initial direct and incremental costs associated with financing activities.

(g)    Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments.  Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash

amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company's borrowings.

All derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.  Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.  Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.  Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.  The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.

The Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or forecasted transaction, and the Company designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) while the ineffective portion of the derivative's change in fair value is recognized in the Statements of Operations as interest expense.  Upon the settlement of a hedge, gains and losses remaining in OCI are amortized over the underlying term of the hedged transaction.

The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions.  The Company assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows and/or forecasted cash flows of the hedged items.

In assessing the valuation of the hedges, the Company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and termination costs at each balance sheet date.  All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.

The cash receipts or payments to settle interest rate swaps are presented in cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

(h)    Income Taxes

The Parent Company believes it qualifies, and intends to continue to qualify, as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).  As a REIT, the Parent Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders are at least equal to REIT taxable income.  Regency Realty Group, Inc. (“RRG”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is a Taxable REIT Subsidiary (“TRS”) as defined in Section 856(l) of the Code.  RRG is subject to federal and state income taxes and files separate tax returns.  As a pass through entity, the Operating Partnership's taxable income or loss is reported by its partners, of which the Parent Company, as general partner and approximately

99.8%

owner, is allocated its pro-rata share of tax attributes.

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2014

Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to stockholders, differs from net income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily because of differences in depreciable lives and cost bases of the shopping centers, as well as other timing differences.

Tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.  Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.  The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years (


and forward for federal and state) based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.

(i)    Earnings per Share and Unit

Basic earnings per share of common stock and unit are computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares and units, respectively, outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share and unit reflect the conversion of obligations and the assumed exercises of securities including the effects of shares issuable under the Company's share-based payment arrangements, if dilutive.  Dividends paid on the Company's share-based compensation awards are not participating securities as they are forfeitable.

(j)    Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants stock-based compensation to its employees and directors. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the award and the cost of the stock-based compensation is expensed over the vesting period.

When the Parent Company issues common shares as compensation, it receives a like number of common units from the Operating Partnership.  The Company is committed to contributing to the Operating Partnership all proceeds from the exercise of stock options or other share-based awards granted under the Parent Company's Long-Term Omnibus Plan (the “Plan”).  Accordingly, the Parent Company's ownership in the Operating Partnership will increase based on the amount of proceeds contributed to the Operating Partnership for the common units it receives.  As a result of the issuance of common units to the Parent Company for stock-based compensation, the Operating Partnership accounts for stock-based compensation in the same manner as the Parent Company.

(k)    Segment Reporting

The Company's business is investing in retail shopping centers through direct ownership or through joint ventures.  The Company actively manages its portfolio of retail shopping centers and may from time to time make decisions to sell lower performing properties or developments not meeting its long-term investment objectives.  The proceeds from sales are reinvested into higher quality retail shopping centers, through acquisitions or new developments, which management believes will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns.  It is management's intent that all retail shopping centers will be owned or developed for investment purposes; however, the Company may decide to sell all or a portion of a development upon completion.  The Company's revenues and net income are generated from the operation of its investment portfolio.  The Company also earns fees for services provided to manage and lease retail shopping centers owned through joint ventures.

The Company's portfolio is located throughout the United States. Management does not distinguish or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of allocating resources or capital.  The Company reviews operating and financial data for each property on an individual basis; therefore, the Company defines an operating segment as its individual properties.  The individual properties have been aggregated into one reportable segment based upon their similarities with regard to both the nature and economics of the centers, tenants and operational processes, as well as long-term average financial performance.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2014

(l)    Business Concentration

No single tenant accounts for

5%

or more of revenue and none of the shopping centers are located outside the United States.

(m)    Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.  Therefore, a fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.

•

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

•

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the Company's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.

The Company also remeasures nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new basis event, at fair value in subsequent periods.

(n)    Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2014, the Company prospectively adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, and all sales will be recorded in accordance with the ASU.  The amendments in the ASU change the requirements for reporting discontinued operations.  Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations.  Those strategic shifts should have a major effect on the organization's operations and financial results.  In addition, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(Topic 606), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017.  Early adoption is not permitted.  The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.

purchase price includes the consideration paid to purchase the other partners interest as well as Regency's carrying value in the partnership.

(3)

On December 16, 2014, Regency acquired the remaining

50%

interest and gained control of this previously unconsolidated investment in real estate partnership that owns a single operating property.  As the operating property constitutes a business, acquisition of control was accounted for as a step acquisition and the net assets acquired were recognized at fair value.  A gain of

$18.3 million

was recognized upon remeasurement as the difference between the fair value, of

$14.1 million

, and the carrying value of the Company's previously held equity interest.  The fair value was measured based on an income approach, using rental growth rate of

3.0%

, a discount rate of

and


, the net change in the total valuation allowance was

$3.3 million

and

$1.5 million

, respectfully.

The evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance requires the Company to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The Company's framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets includes weighing recent taxable income (loss), projected future taxable income (loss) of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax assets, the carryforward periods for the net operating loss, including the effect of reversing taxable temporary differences, and prudent feasible tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of deferred tax assets.  As of

December 31, 2014

, the projected future taxable income and unpredictable nature of potential property sales with built in losses within the TRS caused the Company to determine that it is still more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized.  As a result, the deferred tax asset continues to be fully reserved.

The Company accounts for uncertainties in income tax law in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, under which tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.  Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.  The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.  Federal and state tax returns are open from

Prior to issuing the bonds, the Company locked in the ten year treasury rate using forward starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising.  In connection with the issuance of the new bonds, the Company terminated and settled these swaps, resulting in net cash proceeds of

$4.6 million

.  These proceeds will offset bond interest expense over the life of the bonds, resulting in a lower effective interest rate of

3.59%

.

Derivatives in an asset position are included within Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, while those in a liability position are included within Accounts Payable and Other Liabilities.


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2014

These derivative financial instruments are all interest rate swaps, which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.  The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.  The Company has master netting agreements, however the Company does not have multiple derivatives subject to a single master netting agreement with the same counterparties.  Therefore none are offset in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company expects to issue new debt in


and


.  In order to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising before new borrowings are obtained, the Company previously entered into

$220 million

of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in


and another

$220 million

of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in


.  These interest rate swaps lock in the 10-year treasury rate and swap spread at a weighted average fixed rate of

2.67%

and

3.48%

, respectively.  A current market based credit spread applicable to Regency will be added to the locked in fixed rate at time of issuance that will determine the final bond yield.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings within interest expense.

The following table represents the effect of the derivative financial instruments on the accompanying consolidated financial statements (in thousands):

As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company expects

$8.7 million

of net deferred losses on derivative instruments accumulated in other comprehensive income to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months, of which

$8.0 million

is related to previously settled swaps.

However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The Company develops its judgments based on the best information available at the measurement date, including expected cash flows, appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates, and available observable and unobservable inputs.  Service providers involved in fair value measurements are evaluated for competency and qualifications on an ongoing basis.  The Company's valuation policies and procedures are determined by its Finance Group, which reports to the Chief  Financial Officer, and the results of material fair value measurements are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.  As considerable judgment is often necessary to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments, the fair values presented above are not necessarily indicative of amounts that will be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments:

Notes Receivable

The fair value of the Company's notes receivable is estimated by calculating the present value of future contractual cash flows discounted at interest rates available for notes of the same terms and maturities, adjusted for counter-party specific credit risk.  The fair value of notes receivable was determined primarily using Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy, which considered counter-party credit risk and loan to value ratio on the underlying property securing the note receivable.

Notes Payable

The fair value of the Company's notes payable is estimated by discounting future cash flows of each instrument at interest rates that reflect the current market rates available to the Company for debt of the same terms and maturities.  Fixed rate loans assumed in connection with real estate acquisitions are recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at fair value at the time the property is acquired.  The fair value of the notes payable was determined using Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.

Unsecured Credit Facilities

The fair value of the Company's unsecured credit facilities is estimated based on the interest rates currently offered to the Company by financial institutions.  The fair value of the credit facilities was determined using Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.

The following interest rates were used by the Company to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments:

(b)  Fair Value Measurements

The following financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Trading Securities Held in Trust

The Company has investments in marketable securities that are classified as trading securities held in trust on the  accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value of the trading securities held in trust was determined using quoted prices in active markets, considered Level 1 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Changes in the value


REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2014

of trading securities are recorded within net investment (income) loss in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Interest Rate Derivatives

The fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.  The Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its interest rate swaps.  As a result, the Company determined that its interest rate swaps valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The following table presents the placement in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):

The following tables present assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (in thousands):

Long-lived assets held and used are comprised primarily of real estate.  Fair value for the long-lived assets held and used measured using Level 3 inputs was determined through the use of market comparables to estimate anticipated sales value. The income approach estimates an income stream for a property (typically 10 years) and discounts this income plus a reversion (presumed sale) into a present value at a risk adjusted rate.  Yield rates and growth assumptions utilized in this approach are derived from property specific information, market transactions, and other financial and industry data.  The terminal cap rate and discount rate are significant inputs to this valuation.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2014

The Company established its stock-based compensation plan (the "Plan") under which the Board of Directors may grant stock options and other stock-based awards to officers, directors, and other key employees.  The Plan allows the Company to issue up to

4.1 million

shares in the form of the Parent Company's common stock or stock options.  As of

December 31, 2014

, there were

2.8 million

shares available for grant under the Plan either through stock options or restricted stock.

Stock Option Awards

Stock options are granted under the Plan with an exercise price equal to the Parent Company's stock's price at the date of grant.  All stock options granted have

ten

-year lives, contain vesting terms of

one

to

five

years from the date of grant and some have dividend equivalent rights.  The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton closed-form (“Black-Scholes”) option valuation model.  The Company believes that the use of the Black-Scholes model meets the fair value measurement objectives of FASB ASC Topic 718 and reflects all substantive characteristics of the instruments being valued.

Restricted Stock Awards

The Company grants restricted stock under the Plan to its employees as a form of long-term compensation and retention.  The terms of each restricted stock grant vary depending upon the participant's responsibilities and position within the Company.  The Company's stock grants can be categorized as either time-based awards, performance-based awards, or market-based awards.  All awards are valued at fair value, earn dividends throughout the vesting period, and have no voting rights.  Fair value is measured using the grant date market price for all time-based or performance-based awards.  Market based awards are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value based on the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the projected stock price at the time of payout, discounted to the valuation date over a three year performance period.  Assumptions include historic volatility over the previous three year period, risk-free interest rates, and Regency's historic daily return as compared to the market index.  Since the award payout includes dividend equivalents and the total shareholder return includes the value of dividends, no dividend yield assumption is required for the valuation.  Compensation expense is measured at the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period for the entire award.

The following table summarizes non-vested restricted stock activity during the year ended

December 31, 2014

:

(1)

Time-based awards vest

25%

per year beginning on the first anniversary following the grant date.  These grants are subject only to continued employment and are not dependent on future performance measures.  Accordingly, if such vesting criteria are not met, compensation cost previously recognized would be reversed.

(2)

Performance-based awards are earned subject to future performance measurements.  Once the performance criteria are achieved and the actual number of shares earned is determined, shares will vest over a required service period.  If such performance criteria are not met, compensation cost previously recognized would be reversed.  The Company considers the likelihood of meeting the performance criteria based upon management's estimates from which it determines the amounts recognized as expense on a periodic basis.

(3)

Market-based awards are earned dependent upon the Company's total shareholder return in relation to the shareholder return of peer indices over a

three

-year period (“TSR Grant”).  Once the market criteria are met and the actual number of shares earned is determined, 100% of the earned shares vest.  The probability of meeting the market criteria is considered when calculating the estimated fair value on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation.  These awards are accounted for as awards with market criteria, with compensation cost recognized over the service period, regardless of whether the market criteria are achieved and the awards are ultimately earned and vest.  The significant assumptions underlying determination of fair values for market-based awards granted were as follows:
