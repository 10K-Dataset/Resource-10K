PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Our principal business activity is the design, development, marketing and distribution of technologically advanced, branded performance products for men, women and youth. We design and sell a broad offering of apparel and accessories that
utilize a variety of synthetic microfiber fabrications. Our active wear and sports apparel accessories are designed to wick perspiration away from the skin, help regulate body temperature, enhance comfort and mobility and improve performance
regardless of weather condition.

Our products are offered worldwide in over 8,700 retail stores and can currently be purchased across the
United States, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom through large national and regional chains of retailers, as well as smaller, independent and specialty retailers. Our products are worn by professional football, baseball, basketball, hockey and
soccer players, as well as athletes in major collegiate and Olympic sports. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers operating in 19 countries. Most of our products are manufactured in facilities outside of the
United States.

Our revenues are generated primarily from sales to retail stores. We also derive revenue from the sale of our products
directly to athletes and other users through our sports marketing group, to consumers through our retail outlet stores and through our website and toll-free call center. During 2005, our net revenues grew 37% to $281.1 million from $205.2 million in
2004 and our income from operations increased 41% to $35.9 million in 2005 from $25.4 million in 2004. Our net income increased to $19.7 million in 2005 from $16.3 million in 2004.

We were incorporated in Maryland in 1996 as KP Sports, Inc. In March 2005, we changed our name to Under Armour, Inc. As used in this report, the terms
“we,” “us,” “Under Armour” and the “Company” refer to Under Armour, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. We have a number of registered marks, including Under Armour

Products

Our products are engineered to replace cotton in the world of athletics and fitness with performance alternatives designed and merchandised along
gearlines. Our products are offered in a variety of styles and fits intended to enhance comfort and performance. We offer products for men, women and youth that extend across the sporting goods, outdoor and active lifestyle markets. For 2005, sales
of mens, womens and youth products represented 67%, 19% and 7% of net revenues, respectively, with the remaining 7% divided equally between licensing and accessories. Within each gearline our garments come in three fit types: compression (tight
fitting), fitted (athletic cut) and loose (relaxed). We market our products at multiple price levels and seek to provide all consumers with what we believe to be a superior alternative to cotton and other traditional products.

Our three primary gearlines are marketed to tell a very simple story about our highly technical products. We market our products for consumers to choose
HeatGear when it is hot, ColdGear when it is cold and AllSeasonGear between the extremes.

HeatGear

HeatGear is designed to be worn
in warm to hot temperatures under equipment or as a single layer. Our first compression T-shirt was the original HeatGear product and remains our signature style. While a sweat- soaked cotton T-shirt can weigh two to three pounds, HeatGear is
engineered with a microfiber blend designed to wick moisture from the body which helps the body stay cool, dry and light. We offer HeatGear in a


variety of tops and bottoms in a broad array of colors and styles for wear in the gym or outside in warm weather, making it our top-selling year-round
gearline. Compression fit HeatGear, which is designed to reduce muscle fatigue, is particularly popular for training sessions and competition.

ColdGear

Because athletes sweat in cold weather as well as in the heat, ColdGear is designed to wick moisture from the body while circulating body heat from hotspots to help maintain core body temperature. Our ColdGear apparel
provides both dryness and warmth in a single light layer that can be worn beneath a jersey, uniform, protective gear or ski-vest and our ColdGear outerwear products protect the athlete (and the coach, fan and others) from the outside in. Our
ColdGear product offerings generally sell at higher price levels.

AllSeasonGear

AllSeasonGear is designed to be worn in changing
temperatures and uses technical fabrics to keep the wearer cool and dry in warmer temperatures while preventing a chill in cooler temperatures.

Performance Bags, Socks and Headwear

Our bags, socks and headwear are designed to be used and worn before, during and after competition, and feature performance advantages and functionality similar to our other product offerings. We
work with our licensees to develop accessories, including baseball caps, knit caps, visors, socks and performance bags. We currently have agreements with two accessory licensees: Moretz Sports manufactures performance socks under the Under Armour
brand, and JR286 manufactures Under Armour hats, bags and wristbands. Under Armour product, marketing and sales teams are actively involved in all steps of the design process in order to maintain brand standards and consistency.

Gloves

Our baseball batting gloves and football gloves are offered within our HeatGear and ColdGear lines and are designed with advanced
fabrications to provide the same level of performance as our other products. Our gloves provide moisture management, a secure fit, durability, protection and a better grip for the athlete.

We intend to enter the footwear market with a line of football cleats that we expect to offer for the fall 2006 season and a line of baseball cleats that
we expect to offer for the spring 2007 season.

Marketing and Promotion

Our performance products are designed for use in a variety of sports and other activities. We currently focus on marketing and selling our products to
consumers for use in athletics and outdoor activities. We maintain strict control over our brand image with an in-house marketing and promotions department that designs and produces all of our advertising campaigns. We seek to drive consumer demand
for our products by building brand identity and awareness, as a leading performance alternative to cotton and non-performance apparel and footwear.

Sports Marketing

Our marketing and promotion efforts begin with a strategy of selling our products to high performing
athletes and teams on the collegiate and professional levels. We implement this strategy through collegiate sponsorships, individual athlete agreements, and by selling our products directly to team equipment managers and to individual athletes. As a
result, our uniforms, batting gloves, socks and other items of apparel are seen on the field, giving our products exposure to various consumer audiences, through television, magazines and live at sporting events. This exposure to consumers helps us
establish on-field authenticity as consumers can see our products being worn by high-performing athletes. We are the official uniform supplier of the University of Maryland football team and the official outfitter of the Auburn University athletic
program. We supply uniforms, sideline apparel and fan gear for these teams. We also have sponsorship agreements with a limited number of individual athletes. While our roster of athletes has included established stars, like LaVar Arrington, Jake
Plummer and Martina Navratilova, our strategy has been and continues to be to find the next generation of stars, like 2005 tennis player Robby Ginepri, Major League Baseball (“MLB”) player Lance Berkman and 2005 MLB All-Star Alfonso
Soriano. In addition to individual athletes, we sell our products to teams domestically including professional football teams and Division I men’s and women’s collegiate athletic teams, including many of the 117 Division I college football
programs. We are a licensee of the National Hockey League, and an official


supplier to the U.S. Ski team and USA Rugby. Internationally, we are selling product to European football teams, and we are an official supplier of
performance apparel to the Fulham Football Club, and the England and Wales Cricket Board. We believe these relationships create significant on-field product and brand exposure that contributes to our on-field authenticity.

We seek to sponsor events to drive awareness and brand authenticity from a grassroots level. For example, we are a sponsor of the ESPY Awards Show each
July and use the national platform to launch our fall commercial campaigns, and we also sponsor ESPN’s Bassmasters Classic to reach hunting and fishing enthusiasts. In keeping with our “next great athlete” strategy, we also sponsor
several events such as the College Football All Star Challenge, which is broadcast nationally within Super Bowl programming and features the country’s top players headed for the NFL. In addition, we are the title sponsor of The Under Armour
(Baltimore) Marathon, and we make a significant brand appearance at numerous other major races.

Media and Promotion

We feature our men’s and women’s products in a variety of national publications such as

ESPN the Magazine

,

Maxim

and

People
Magazine

, and we also advertise regularly in several outdoor and sport-specific publications.

Our signature “Protect this
House” television campaign features several NFL players. The campaign runs in a variety of lengths and formats and is used in several NFL and collegiate stadiums during games as a crowd prompt. Our women’s campaign stars Heather Mitts of
the US Olympic soccer team and runs on cable and network television. Similarly, our ability to secure product placement in movies, television shows and video games has allowed us to reinforce our authenticity as well as establish our brand with
broader audiences who may not have been exposed to our advertising and brand efforts previously.

Retail Development and Product
Presentation

The primary component of our retail brand strategy is to increase floor space dedicated to our products. The design and
funding of in-store fixtures with our major retail accounts is a key initiative for securing prime floor space, establishing our brand and educating the consumer about our brand.

We use in-store fixtures and displays that highlight our logo and have a performance-oriented, athletic look across our many retailers. We provide
retailers with what we believe are aggressive, exciting and unique brand-building fixtures, such as our “Big E” mannequin, a life size mold of Eric Ogbogu, a 6’4”, 275 pound NFL defensive end, and the featured athlete in our
award-winning “Protect This House” campaign. To target women consumers, we use a complementary mannequin, the UA WOMAN, modeled after the star of our women’s campaign, Heather Mitts. These displays not only provide an easily
identifiable place for consumers to look for our products, they are intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinct from our competitors.

We work with our retailers to establish optimal placement for our products and to have the brand represented in the many departments of a traditional large national or regional chain. The fixtures and displays enable
us to achieve placement of our products throughout stores by providing retailers with outposts to use in various store sections.

Customers

Our products are offered in over 7,000 retail stores in North America and over 8,700 retail stores world wide, which we refer to as
wholesale distribution. We also sell our products directly to athletes and teams through our sports marketing group, to consumers through our website and toll-free call center, and through our retail outlet stores. We rely on our distribution
facility in Glen Burnie, Maryland for substantially all of our product distribution.


Wholesale Distribution

In 2005, 90.5% of our net revenues were derived from wholesale distribution. Our principal customers include regional retail chains, such as Dick’s
Sporting Goods, The Sports Authority, Academy Ltd., Modell’s Sporting Goods, Hibbett Sporting Goods; hunting and fishing, mountain sports and outdoor retailers such as REI, Gander Mountain, Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops; and The Army and Air
Force Exchange Service. In 2005, our two largest customers were, in alphabetical order, Dick’s Sporting Goods and The Sports Authority. These two customers accounted for approximately 36% of our net revenues, and each of these customers
individually accounted for at least 10% of our net revenues in 2005.

In 2005, 67% of our wholesale distribution was derived from large
format national and regional retail chains in North America. Additional wholesale distribution in 2005 was derived from independent and specialty retailers. These retailers are serviced by a combination of in-house sales personnel and third-party
commissioned manufacturer’s representatives. These retail stores continue to represent an important part of our product distribution strategy and help build on the authenticity of our products. In addition to reaching the general public, they
sell to institutional athletic departments, leagues and teams. Our independent sales also include sales to military specialists, fitness specialists, outdoor retailers and other specialty channels throughout the United States.

Direct Distribution

Approximately 6%
of our net revenues in 2005 were generated through direct sales, primarily through our website at our manufacturers suggested retail price. Direct sales also include sales through our retail outlet stores and sales by our sports marketing group for
use by professional and college athletes.

Product Licensing

In addition to generating revenues through wholesale and direct distribution, we generate revenues from licensing arrangements to manufacture and distribute Under Armour branded products to the market quickly. While
we have confidence in our ability to increase net revenues through arrangements with licensees, we carefully select each of our licensees and take measures to preserve our existing distribution channels. To date, we have formed product licensing
relationships with two domestic licensees, one for socks and one for accessories, and one Japanese licensee, which, in 2005 collectively accounted for 3.5% of our net revenues. In spring 2006, our net revenues will benefit from a third domestic
licensee who will distribute a limited assortment of our products to college bookstores and golf shops. In order to maintain consistent quality and performance, we pre-approve all products manufactured and sold by our product licensees and our
quality assurance team demands that the products meet the same quality and compliance standards as the products that we sell directly.

International
Revenues

We believe that the trend toward performance products is global, and we intend to introduce our products and simple
merchandising story to athletes throughout the world. In 2005, approximately 3% of our net revenues were generated in Canada; approximately 2% of our net revenues were generated in Japan; and 0.3% of our net revenues were generated in Europe. We
anticipate that our introduction of performance apparel internationally will be approached methodically, in a manner consistent with our past brand-building strategy—by selling our products directly to teams and individual athletes in these
markets, thereby providing us with product exposure to broad audiences of potential consumers in these markets.

We entered the Japanese
market in 1999 through a distribution arrangement with Dome Corporation. In 2002, we entered into a license agreement with this company, and it now produces, markets and sells our branded products. We work closely with this licensee to develop
variations of our products for the different sizes, sports interests and preferences of the Japanese consumer. Our branded products are now sold in Japan to professional sports teams, including baseball and soccer teams, to over 1,100 independent
specialty stores and through over 650 large sporting goods retailers, such as Mega Sports/Sports Authority, Alpen, Xebio and Sports Depot.


In late 2003, we formed a Canadian subsidiary through which we derive our Canadian revenues. Prior to
2003, our products had been sold in Canada by independent sales representatives. Our Canadian subsidiary sells directly to teams and retail chains and also distributes products through manufacturers’ representatives to independent sporting
goods dealers. The Canadian market is a natural extension of our products and our brand recognition in the United States. The extension into Canada was initially driven by our direct sales to several National Hockey League teams.

In 2005, we expanded our sales into Europe, beginning with the United Kingdom. We have sold our branded products to numerous players on European football
teams, on First Division clubs and multiple cricket clubs in the United Kingdom, on soccer teams in Italy, Holland, Ireland and Germany as well as on many of the Guinness Premiership rugby clubs. In addition, in January 2006, we announced the
opening of our European headquarters in Amsterdam, from which our European sales, marketing and logistics functions are operated.

Seasonality

Historically, we have recognized over 75% of our income from operations in the third and fourth quarters of the year driven by
increased sales volume of our products during the fall season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of our higher priced ColdGear line. Approximately 62% and 66% of our net revenues were generated during the last
two quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accordingly, we tend to have higher levels of receivables in the third and fourth quarters and higher levels of cash in-flows from these receivables in the first and fourth quarters. Nonetheless, we
believe that our seasonality in recent years may have been somewhat overstated due to our significant growth in net revenues.

Product Design and
Development

Our products are manufactured with sophisticated fabrics produced by third parties and designed in collaboration with our
development team. This approach enables us to select from the best, most technically advanced fabrics available, produced to our specifications, while focusing our product development efforts on design, fit and product use. Therefore, we do not
incur significant research and development costs and believe we have limited exposure to rapidly changing fabric technology.

We seek to
constantly upgrade and improve our gearlines with the latest in fabric technology, while extending our product offerings. Our goal, which is to deliver superior performance in all Under Armour gearlines and products, provides our developers and
licensees with a clear, overarching direction for the brand and helps them identify new opportunities to replace basic cotton products with our performance products. We design products with “visible technology,” utilizing color, texture
and fabrication to enhance our customers’ perception and understanding of product use and benefits.

Our product development team has
significant prior industry experience at leading fabric suppliers and branded athletic apparel and shoe companies throughout the world. This team works closely with our sports marketing, outdoors and tactical sales teams and professional and
collegiate athlete consumers to identify product trends and determine market needs. For example, these teams worked closely together to identify the opportunity and market for our UA Tech-T, a synthetic shirt which we introduced in 2005 that is
intended to look and feel like cotton, but that also includes our performance product attributes.

Sourcing, Manufacturing and Quality Assurance

Many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be
available, in the short term, from a limited number of sources. The fabric used to manufacture our products is sourced by our manufacturers from a limited number of suppliers pre-approved by us. In 2005, approximately 54% of the fabric used in our
products came from four suppliers: Joy Textiles in Mexico, McMurray Fabrics in the Dominican Republic, and United Knitting and Milliken & Company in the United States. Our largest single supplier during that period was Joy Textiles, which
supplied 20% of our total


fabric requirements. We continue to seek to add new suppliers and believe, although there can be no assurance, that this concentration will decrease over
time. The fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum based products, that may be subject to price fluctuations and shortages.

Substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers and, in 2005, three manufacturers produced approximately 35% of our
products. In 2005, our products were manufactured by 18 primary manufacturers, operating in 19 countries. During 2005, approximately 50% of our products were manufactured in Central and South America, with 43% in Asia and 7% manufactured in the
United States. All manufacturers are evaluated for quality systems, social compliance and financial strength by our quality assurance team prior to being selected and on an ongoing basis. We strive to qualify multiple manufacturers where appropriate
for particular product types and fabrications. We also actively seek out vendors that can perform multiple manufacturing stages, such as procuring fabric and providing finished products, helping us to reduce the cost of goods sold. We enter into a
variety of agreements with our manufacturers, including non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to a code of conduct regarding quality of manufacturing and working conditions and other
social concerns. We do not, however, have any long-term agreements requiring us to utilize any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products in the long term.

In December 2003, we opened a Hong Kong office to help support manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts in Asia. The employees in our
Hong Kong office apply the same principles as our domestic product development, sourcing and quality assurance teams, helping to maintain uniform quality for all products.

We also manufacture a limited number of products on-premises in our quick turn, Special Make-Up Shop located at our distribution facility in Glen Burnie,
Maryland. This 17,000 square-foot shop is stocked with our fabric in multiple colors to help us build and ship products on tight deadlines for high-profile athletes, leagues and teams as well as actors and other entertainers. While the products
manufactured in the quick turn, Special Make-Up Shop represent an immaterial portion of our total net revenues, we believe the facility helps us to provide superior service to the teams, athletes and entertainers whom we believe help drive consumer
demand for our products.

Order Fulfillment and Inventory Management

We package and distribute all of our products through our distribution facility in Glen Burnie, Maryland, approximately 15 miles from our Baltimore, Maryland headquarters, which is a cross-dock, high-bay facility
built in 2000. We currently occupy approximately 245,000 square feet for a five-year term, with increasing requirements to lease up to 359,000 square feet by April 2009. As a result of the improvements already made to the facility and the excess
available space, we believe the building will be adequate to meet our needs for the next several years.

Inventory management is important
to the financial condition and operating results of our business. We address inventory management by focusing our efforts on processes such as retail merchandising, strategic liquidation through our own retail outlet stores, and forecasting and
maximizing the flexibility of our supply chain to ensure rapid reaction to demands. We manage our inventory levels based on any existing orders, anticipated sales and the rapid-delivery requirements of our customers. Our practice, and the general
practice in the apparel industry, is to offer retail customers the right to return defective or improperly shipped merchandise. Because of the relatively long lead-times for production and design of our products, from time to time we commence
production of new products before we receive any orders for those products, which affects our inventory levels for new products.

Intellectual Property

We believe we own the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of all of our products, both
domestically and internationally, where our products are currently either sold or


manufactured. Our major trademarks include the Under Armour logo and design and Under Armour wordmark, both of which are registered in the United States, the
European Union, Japan, Taiwan, China and Canada, among other places. We also own trademark registrations for HeatGear

®

, ColdGear

®

, AllseasonGear

®

and Advantage is Undeniable

®

, and we have applied to register our Protect This House

™

, Under Armour logo/Metal, Duplicity

™

and Click-Clack

™

trademarks. We also own domain names for our primary trademarks and hold copyrights for our Good-Bye Girl and Protect this House commercials. We intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks and
copyrights we utilize today and those we develop in the future. We will continue to aggressively police our trademarks and pursue those who infringe, both domestically and internationally.

We believe that the distinctive marks that we use in connection with our products are important in building our brand image and distinguishing our
products from those of others. These marks are among our most valuable assets. In addition to our distinctive marks, we also place significant value on our trade dress, which is the overall image and appearance of our products, and we believe that
our trade dress helps to distinguish our products in the marketplace.

The intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and
processes used to manufacture our products generally are owned or controlled by our suppliers. As a result, our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently do not own any fabric or process patents, except for a
pending patent application that includes Kevin Plank as a co-inventor. We focus our efforts on obtaining patent protection for what we believe to be strategic, new product applications in the marketplace. We have filed patent applications in
connection with certain of our products that we believe offer a unique utility or function, such as the Duplicity Sports Bra, the Coldgear Hood and the Grippy Shirt. We will continue to file patent applications where we deem appropriate to protect
our inventions and designs.

Competition

The market for active sports apparel is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. The fabrics and
technology used in manufacturing our products are generally not unique to us, and we do not currently own any fabric or process patents or copyrights. Many of our competitors are large apparel and sporting goods companies with strong worldwide brand
recognition and significantly greater resources than us, such as Nike and Adidas. We also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoors and tactical apparel, and private label offerings of certain retailers, including
some of our customers.

In addition, purchasing decisions by retailers and their decisions regarding the limited use of floor space in
their stores means that we also must compete with others to develop relationships with retailers for their limited attention. We believe we have been successful in this area because of the good relationships we have developed and as a result of the
strong sales of our products. However, if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors’ products, they may favor the display and sale of those products.

We believe that we have been able to compete successfully because of our brand image and recognition, the performance and quality of our products and our selective distribution policies. We also believe that our
focused gearline merchandising story differentiates us from our competition. In the future we expect to compete for consumer preferences and expect that we may face greater competition on pricing, as well. This may favor larger competitors with
lower costs per unit of product produced that can spread the effect of price discounts across a larger array of products and across a larger customer base than ours. The purchasing decisions of consumers for our products also often reflect highly
subjective preferences that can be influenced by many factors, including advertising, media, product sponsorships, product improvements and changing styles.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, we had 610 employees, of which 596 were employed in the United States. Of the 596
U.S. employees, 138 were employed in sales and marketing, 34 were employed in sourcing and production,


213 were employed in distribution, 23 were employed in our quick turn, Special Make-Up Shop and the remaining 188 performed selling, general and
administrative functions, including, executive, finance, administration and business development. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work stoppages, and we believe our
relations with our employees are good.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Forward-Looking Statements

Some of the statements contained in this Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate to
expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts, such as statements regarding our future financial condition or results of
operations, our prospects and strategies for future growth, the development and introduction of new products, and the implementation of our marketing and branding strategies. In many cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such
as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “intends,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or the negative
of these terms or other comparable terminology.

The forward-looking statements contained in Form 10-K reflect our current views about
future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause events or our actual activities or results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Although we
believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future events, results, actions, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those factors described below under “Risk
Factors” and in “ Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk .” These factors include, without limitation:

•

our ability to manage our growth effectively;

•

our ability to maintain effective internal controls;

•

increased competition causing us to reduce the prices of our products or to increase significantly our marketing efforts in order to avoid losing market share;

•

changes in consumer preferences or the reduction in demand for performance apparel and other products;


•

our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products;

•

reduced demand for sporting goods and apparel generally;

•

failure of our suppliers or manufacturers to produce or deliver our products in a timely or cost-effective manner;

•

our ability to accurately anticipate and respond to seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our operating results;

•

our ability to effectively market and maintain a positive brand image;

•

the availability and effective operation of management information systems and other technology;

•

our ability to attract and maintain the services of our senior management and key employees; and

•

changes in general economic or market conditions, including as a result of political or military unrest or terrorist attacks.

The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K reflect our views and assumptions only as of the date of this Form 10-K. We undertake no
obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by numerous risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors
detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this Form 10-K. Should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted.

If we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to manage that growth effectively and our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline.

We have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $281.1 million in 2005 from
$19.7 million in 2001. Our substantial growth has placed a significant strain on our management systems and resources. If our operations continue to grow, we will be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development
and distribution functions and to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology as well as obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. This expansion could increase the strain on these and other resources,
and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees, difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products,
and delays in production and shipments. These difficulties would likely result in the erosion of our brand image and a resulting decrease in net revenues, net income and the price of our Class A Common Stock.

We are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards.

We completed our initial public offering in 2005. We are spending a significant amount of management time and external resources to
comply with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”), new SEC regulations and NASDAQ Stock Market rules. Our management team has limited
experience operating a public reporting company. As a result, we will likely need to continue to improve our financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures.

Section 404 of SOX requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and attestations of the
effectiveness of these controls by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm. We are required by Section 404 to be compliant by December 31, 2006. We believe adequate resources and expertise, both internal and
external have been put in place to meet this


requirement. We intend to work closely with our independent registered public accounting firm during this process. Though we have taken efforts to become SOX
compliant by the end of 2006, there is no guarantee that it will result in management assurance or an attestation by the independent auditors that internal controls over financial reporting are adequate. In the event that our Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer or independent registered public accounting firm determines that our controls over financial reporting are not effective as required by Section 404 of SOX, investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected
and, among other things, this could cause a decline in the price of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, our overhead may increase and our net income may decline as a percentage of net revenues as a result of the additional costs associated
with complying with the complex legal regime associated with being a public reporting company.

Our profitability may decline as a result of increasing
pressure on margins.

Our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition,
consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline
if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. If our gross margin declines and we fail to sufficiently reduce our cost of goods sold or grow our net revenues, our profitability will decline, and we
could incur operating losses that we may be unable to fund or sustain for extended periods of time, if at all. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition and could result in a decline in
the price of our Class A Common Stock.

A decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of
revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth.

In 2005, approximately 36% of our net revenues were generated from sales to
our two largest customers, Dick’s Sporting Goods and The Sports Authority. The percentage of our net revenues attributable to these customers has increased in recent years as these customers opened new store locations and devoted an increased
portion of their floor space to our products. We expect this trend to continue in 2006. However, we do not enter into long-term sales contracts with these or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on
our position in the marketplace. As a result, we face the risk that one or more of these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with
us. The failure to increase our sales to these customers as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers’ business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and
net income.

Sales of performance products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business.

We believe that continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance products will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from
traditional alternatives, such as basic cotton T-shirts, to performance products. If consumers are not convinced that performance products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely
affected. In addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced that performance products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced that they are worth the extra
cost. If industry-wide sales of performance products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.

If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability.

Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to
changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer


acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products
altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. There can be no assurance that we will respond to changing preferences in a timely manner. Failure to anticipate and respond to changing
consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels.

Even if we are successful in anticipating
consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative products, and there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In addition,
there can be no assurance that our strategy of continuing to expand the range of performance products that we offer into new product categories will be well received by consumers or will not dilute our brand image and result in a shift of consumer
preferences away from our product lines. The failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition and result in a decline in the price of our Class A Common Stock.

If the financial condition
of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

We extend credit to
our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. We face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling
with economic uncertainty. A slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an
adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables, our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and our financial condition.

If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market would be adversely affected.

We rely on our distribution facility in Glen Burnie, Maryland, which became fully operational in July 2004, for substantially all of our product distribution. Our distribution facility includes computer
controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions or other
system failures. In addition, because substantially all of our products are distributed from one location, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution facility. We maintain business
interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facility, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. In
addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facility. If we encounter problems with our distribution facility, our ability to
meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.

We rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or
in sufficient quantity.

Many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third
parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. Substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2005, three manufacturers produced over 35% of our products. We have no
long-term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity.

There can be no assurance that there will not be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to locate alternative


suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be
able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increased demand, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing
capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand
existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. Any delays,
interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the
short and long term.

In addition, there can be no assurance that our suppliers and manufacturers will continue to provide fabrics and raw
materials and to manufacture products that are consistent with our standards. We have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. In that event, unless
we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. In addition, because we do not control our
manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace.

The cost of raw materials could affect our operating results.

The fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum-based products. Significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials may materially
adversely affect our cost of goods sold, results of operations and financial condition, and cause a decline in the price of our Class A Common Stock.

Sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image.

A key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. We previously gained significant publicity and brand name recognition from the perceived
sponsorships associated with professional and collegiate athletes and sports programs using our products. The use of our products by athletes and teams was frequently without our paying compensation or in exchange for our furnishing product at a
reduced cost or without charge and without formal arrangements. We also have licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel to a variety of sports leagues and Olympic teams. However, as competition in the performance apparel
industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have risen dramatically, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. There is no
assurance that we will be able to retain existing or attract new athletes or sports programs to wear or endorse our products or retain official supplier agreements at a reasonable cost, or at all. If we are unable to maintain our current association
with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products and may be required to modify and substantially increase the cost of our marketing plan. As a result, our brand image,
net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected.

We operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources
of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenues and gross profit.

The market for active sports apparel is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies
expanding their production and marketing of performance


products. Because we currently own no fabric or process patents or copyrights, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products
with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. Many of our competitors are large apparel and sporting goods companies with strong worldwide brand recognition, such as Nike and Adidas that have significantly greater
financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. Because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor and tactical apparel and private label offerings
of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. Many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger sales forces, bigger advertising budgets, better brand recognition among
consumers, greater economies of scale and long-term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. As a
result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by:

•

quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements;

•

readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities;

•

discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off;

•

devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement and product endorsement;

•

adopting aggressive pricing policies; and

•

engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes.

In addition, while a component of one of our key growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores, retailers have limited resources and floor space and we must compete with others to
develop relationships with them. Increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater
margins from our competitors’ products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. Our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross profit margin could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast
demand for our products.

To minimize purchasing costs and ensure supply, we generally place orders with our manufacturers at least
90-120 days prior to the time we need to deliver our products. However, we generally do not receive firm customer orders prior to 30 days before the date those orders are to be shipped. In addition, a significant portion of our net
revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our peak season from August through November. Because we place orders for products with our manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm
and because we receive a significant volume of at-once orders, if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers.

Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include:

•

an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products or for products of our competitors;

•

our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance for our new products;

•

new product introductions by competitors;

•

unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by
retailers;


•

weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and

•

terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials.

Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess
inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on gross margin. In addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could
result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory demand in order to
meet future order and reorder requirements.

The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of
operations and financial condition from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products is likely to result in an unexpected adverse effect on our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast
such effects with any certainty in advance.

Our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income,
which could adversely affect the price of our Class A Common Stock.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income. These variations are primarily related to increased sales of our products during the fall season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of sales
of our higher priced ColdGear line. Approximately 62% and 66% of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of the introduction of and advertising for new products and
changes in our product mix. Variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. For example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our ColdGear
line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations.

As a result of these seasonal and quarterly
fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. Any seasonal
or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. This could cause the price of our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate significantly.

Labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business.

Our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. As a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and
operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. Labor disputes at various ports, such as those experienced at western U.S. ports in 2002, or at our suppliers or manufacturers, create significant risks for
our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in cancelled
orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income.

The value of our brand, and sales of
our products, could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity.

We require that our suppliers, independent
manufacturers and licensees of our products operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other


standards and policies we impose on them. We do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. A violation of our
policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. Negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers, manufacturers
or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturing sources or licensees.

In addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an
official supplier. Actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues could also harm our brand image and result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net
income, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity and the price of our Class A Common Stock.

We rely
significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.

Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise
resource system and our warehouse management system, both of which were purchased from third parties and implemented in 2002. Since then, we have updated and supplemented these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems
with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, including difficulties with the operation or implementation of our new enterprise resource system software that is scheduled to become operational during 2006, or a breach in security of these
systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. We cannot assure you that such events will not occur.

Our international operations and the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could
harm our business.

In 2005, our products were manufactured by 18 primary manufacturers, operating in 19 countries. In 2005,
approximately 50% of our products were manufactured in Central and South America, with 43% in Asia and 7% manufactured in the United States. In addition, approximately 5% of our 2005 net revenues were generated through international sales and
licensing fees. As a result of our international manufacturing and sales, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including:

•

political unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured;

•

currency exchange fluctuations;

•

the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, as well
as trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds;

•

reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;

•

understanding foreign consumer tastes and preferences that may differ from those in the United States;

•

complying with foreign laws and regulations that differ from country to country;

•

disruptions or delays in shipments; and

•

changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers, suppliers or customers are located.


These and other factors beyond our control could interrupt our manufacturers’ production in offshore
facilities, influence the ability of our manufacturers to export our products cost-effectively or at all, inhibit our and our unaffiliated manufacturers’ ability to procure certain materials, increase our legal or compliance costs and influence
our ability to sell our products in international markets, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.

Risks Related to Our Management

Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our
senior management and other key employees.

Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior
management and other key employees, particularly Kevin A. Plank, our founder and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and
achieve our business goals.

We also may be unable to retain existing management, technical, sales and client support personnel that are
critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs.

If we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives.

Our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management and product design teams. However, to be successful
in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented employees with a range of skills and experience. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty
from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. With new additions to our senior management we may develop and implement changes in our product
development, merchandising, marketing and operational strategies. There can be no assurance that we would successfully assimilate new senior management and make strategic modifications to our past operating policies in a timely and efficient manner,
and if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain additional senior management with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business.

Risks Related to Proprietary Rights

Our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not
patented or copyrighted and can be imitated by our competitors.

The intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and
processes used to manufacture our products are owned or controlled by our suppliers, except as noted below, and are generally not unique to us. As a result, our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own no
fabric or process patents or copyrights, except for a pending patent application for performance sports garments formed from single-layer, double-faced performance warp knit fabric that includes Kevin Plank as a co-inventor. As a result, our current
and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. Because many of our competitors, such as Nike, Adidas and Reebok, have significantly greater financial,
distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. If our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower
prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.


Our trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be
prevented from selling some of our products.

Our success depends in large part on our brand image. We believe that our registered and
common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. We cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as
we expand our product line and the geographic scope of our marketing. From time to time, we have received claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert intellectual property
claims against us, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. Any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant
monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. Any of these events
could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Our failure to protect our
intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues.

We
currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you
that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. In addition,
intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to
successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. If we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer.

From time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or
unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party’s products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand,
result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business.

We have licensed in the past, and
expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

Not
applicable.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our principal executive and administrative offices are located at 1020 Hull Street in Baltimore, Maryland. We expect that our current administrative offices are sufficient for our expansion plans over the next 24 months. We opened our
central distribution facility in Glen Burnie, Maryland in June 2004. We expect that, in light of our option for additional space, our distribution facility will be able to accommodate substantial growth of our operations.


The general location, use, approximate size and lease renewal date of our properties, none of which is
owned by us, are set forth below:

(1)

We are obligated to increase our leased space up to 265,000 by July 2006 and up to 359,000 square feet by April 2009.

(2)

As of December 31, 2005, we operated five retail outlet stores. We anticipate that we will be able to extend these leases that expire in the near future on satisfactory terms
or relocate to more desirable locations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, we have been involved in various legal proceedings. We believe that all such litigation is routine in nature and incidental to the
conduct of our business, and we believe that no such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operation.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

On November 12, 2005, at a special meting of our
stockholders, the following four matters were put to a vote of our stockholders:

•

Approval and adoption of the Articles of Amendment and Restatement of the Articles of Incorporation of Under Armour and the approval and adoption of an exchange agreement providing
for the issuance of 16,200,000 share of our Class B Convertible Common Stock in exchange for 16,200,000 share of our Class A Common Stock held by Kevin A. Plank and affiliated entities;

•

approval and adoption of our Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees;

•

approval and adoption of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan; and

•

approval and adoption of our 2005 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan.


PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Under Armour’s Class A Common Stock has been traded on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol “UARM” since

Dividends

On December 31, 2004, we declared a cash dividend of $5.0 million, which was paid in January 2005 to our common stockholders. We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings for use in
our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities

Between January 1, 2005 and November 18, 2005, we issued to our directors, officers, employees and consultants options to purchase 1,829,040 shares of our Class A Common Stock at a weighted average exercise price of $6.16 and
we issued 100,000 shares of restricted Class A Common Stock, of which 14,000 shares vested immediately, as compensation under our 2000 Stock Option Plan. The options vest ratably over four to five years. Restrictions on the remaining restricted
stock lapse over a two to five year period. During that same period, options under our 2000 Stock Option Plan were exercised to purchase 1,138,916 shares of our Class A Common Stock for aggregate consideration of $754,904. The issuances of the
securities described in this paragraph were deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance upon


Section 4(2) under the Securities Act of 1933 in that such issuances did not involve a public offering or under Rule 701 promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, in that they were offered and sold pursuant to a written compensatory plan relating to compensation, as provided by Rule 701.

In March 2005, we issued 37,500 shares of Class A Common Stock to our director Thomas J. Sippel for aggregate consideration of $100,000; in April 2005, we issued 37,500 shares of Class A Common Stock to each
of our directors Douglas E. Coltharp and Harvey L. Sanders for aggregate consideration from each of them of $100,000; in August 2005, we issued 9,285 shares of Class A Common Stock to our director A.B. Krongard for aggregate consideration
of $100,000; and in September 2005, we issued 9,285 shares of Class A Common Stock to our director William R. McDermott for aggregate consideration of $100,000. The issuances of the securities described in this paragraph were exempt from
registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance upon Section 4(2) as transactions not involving any public offering.

On
November 18, 2005, in connection with our initial public offering, 1,208,055 shares of a former class of our Class B Convertible Common Stock held by Rosewood Capital IV, LP and Rosewood Capital IV, which we refer to as Convertible Common Stock
held by Rosewood, were converted into an aggregate of 3,624,165 shares of our Class A Common Stock. No consideration was received by us in connection with the conversion of the Convertible Common Stock held by Rosewood. This issuance of
Class A Common Stock upon conversion of the Convertible Common Stock held by Rosewood was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance on Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933 as an exchange by an issuer
with an existing security holder exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange.

On November 18, 2005, in connection with our initial public offering and in exchange for 16,200,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock, we issued an aggregate of 16,200,000 shares of Class B Convertible
Common Stock to Kevin A. Plank and two Kevin A. Plank related entities. No consideration was received by us in connection with the exchange of Class A Common Stock for Class B Convertible Common Stock. Shares of Class B Convertible Common Stock
automatically convert into shares of Class A Common Stock, on a one-for-one basis, upon transfer to a holder other than Kevin A. Plank or a Kevin A. Plank related entity. In addition, all shares of Class B Convertible Common Stock will
convert into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis on the date upon which the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock beneficially owned by Kevin A. Plank and Kevin A. Plank related
entities, in the aggregate, represents less than 15% of the total number of shares of Class A and Class B Convertible Common Stock outstanding. The issuance of the Class B Convertible Common Stock described in this paragraph was exempt from
registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance on Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933 as an exchange by an issuer with an existing security holder exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given
directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange.

Issuer Purchases of Securities

In November 2005, in connection with our initial public offering, we redeemed all 1,200,000 outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for an
aggregate redemption price of $12.0 million.

Initial Public Offering and Use of Proceeds

On November 18, 2005, a registration statement (Registration No. 333-127856) relating to our initial public offering of our Class A Common
Stock was declared effective by the SEC. Under this registration statement, 9,500,000 shares were sold by us, 2,624,000 were sold by selling stockholders and 1,818,600 shares, representing the amount of shares covered by the over-allotment option,
were sold by the selling stockholders identified in the registration statement. All Class A Common Stock registered under the registration statement was sold at a price to the public of $13.00 per share. The offering closed on November 23,
2005. The managing underwriters were Goldman, Sachs & Co., CIBC World Markets Corp., Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, Piper Jaffray & Co. and Thomas Weisel Partners LLC.


The offering terminated after the sale of all of the shares registered on the registration statement. The
gross proceeds from the shares of Class A Common Stock sold by us were $123.5 million. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $112.7 million, after deducting an aggregate of $8.6 million in underwriting discounts and
commissions paid to the underwriters and $2.2 million in other expenses incurred in connection with the offering. We used $49.2 million of these proceeds to:

•

redeem all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $12.0 million; and

•

repay approximately $25.0 million of term debt and $12.2 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

We intend to use the remaining proceeds, or $63.5 million, for general corporate purposes including capital investments and working capital.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the information contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K under the captions “Risk Factors,”
“Selected Financial Data,” and “Business.”

Overview

We are a leading developer, marketer and distributor of branded performance products for men, women and youth. Since our founding in 1995, we have grown
and reinforced our brand name and image through sales to athletes and teams at the collegiate and professional level, as well as sales to consumers with active lifestyles. We believe that Under Armour is a widely recognized athletic brand known for
its performance and authenticity and is uniquely positioned as a performance alternative to cotton and non-performance apparel and footwear.

Our net revenues have grown to $281.1 million in 2005 from $19.7 million in 2001. We believe that our growth in net revenues growth has been driven by a growing interest in performance products and the strength of the Under Armour brand in
the marketplace relative to our competitors, as evidenced by the increases in sales of our men’s core product line as well as consumer acceptance of our new products. Our new products for 2005 included our Metal series, Fleece program, the
Duplicity sports bra and our Tech-T line.

We plan to increase our domestic net revenues by building upon our relationships with existing
customers and expanding our product offerings in new and existing retail stores. By the end of 2005, our products were offered in over 7,000 retail stores in North America, up from approximately 500 retail stores in 2000. In addition, we plan to
expand our product offerings to include additional men’s and women’s performance products as well as expanding further into off-field outdoor sports, including hunting, fishing, running, mountain sports, skiing and golf. We expect our new
product offerings in 2006 to include football and baseball cleats.

We believe that our products will appeal to athletes and consumers with
active lifestyles around the globe. As early as 1999, the Under Armour brand has been sold through a licensee in the Japanese market place. We began selling our products in Canada during 2003 and in the United Kingdom through independent sales
agents in 2005. We plan to increase net revenues internationally by adding product offerings through our Japanese licensee and expanding our Canadian and European distribution.

Our license revenues have grown to $9.8 million in 2005 from $84,000 in 2002. We have entered into licensing agreements with established,
high-quality manufacturers to produce and distribute Under Armour branded products to further reinforce our brand identity and increase our net revenues and gross profit. In exchange for the use of our trademarks, our licensees pay us license
revenues based on their net sales of core products of socks, hats, bags and other accessories. We seek to continue to grow our license revenues by working with our existing licensees to offer additional products and increase their distribution, and
by selectively entering into new licensing agreements.

We believe there is an increasing recognition in the United States of the health
benefits of an active lifestyle. We believe this trend provides us with an expanding consumer base for our products. We also believe there is a shift in consumer demand from basic cotton products to performance products such as those we offer, which
are intended to provide better performance by wicking perspiration away from the skin, helping to regulate body temperature and enhancing comfort. We believe that these shifts in consumer preferences and lifestyles are not unique to the United
States, but are occurring in a number of markets around the world, thereby increasing our opportunities to introduce our performance products to new consumer bases.


Although we believe these trends will facilitate our growth, we also face potential challenges that could
limit our ability to take advantage of these opportunities, including, among others, the risk that we may not be able to manage our rapid growth effectively. In addition, we may not consistently be able to anticipate consumer preferences and develop
new products that meet changing preferences in a timely manner. Furthermore, our industry is very competitive. Our profitability may decline if we experience increasing pressure on margins, if we lose one or more of our key customers or if our
competitors establish the brand loyalty of our current or potential consumers. While we seek to diversify the risk of interruptions in the supply of raw materials for our products and have what we believe is a diverse manufacturing base around the
world, we may still be susceptible to general economic changes such as increases in the costs of raw materials, including petroleum, which is a significant component of many of our products, or other disruptions in the economy or in international
trade. For a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, see “Risk Factors.”

Internal Controls

Since 2004, we have invested significant resources to comprehensively document and analyze our system of internal controls over financial reporting, which
included the hiring of a Director of Internal Audit and the formation of an Internal Audit Department, along with the initiation of a Company-wide internal controls improvement project. The focus of the improvement project, and the steering
committee founded to oversee the project, has been to design, implement and maintain a system of internal controls sufficient to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. Throughout 2005, we continued to document significant processes
and identify areas requiring some improvement, and we are in the process of designing enhanced processes and controls to address these concerns identified. We plan to continue these initiatives as well as prepare for our first management report on
internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”), for the year ending December 31, 2006. We have recently contracted with one of the four largest public accounting
firms, other than our independent registered public accounting firm, to assist us with these efforts. We feel this added expertise and experience will augment our internal resources.

We believe adequate resources and expertise, both internal and external, have been put in place to meet the Section 404 requirements. We intend to
work closely with our independent registered public accounting firm during this process. Though we have taken efforts to become SOX compliant by the end of 2006, there is no guarantee that our efforts will result in a management assurance, or an
attestation by our independent auditors, that the operating effectiveness and design of our internal controls are adequate.

General

Net revenues comprise both net sales and license revenues. Net sales comprise our four primary product categories, including mens, womens, youth and
accessories. For further detail, see “Results of Operations.”

Cost of goods sold consists primarily of product costs, inbound
freight and duty costs, handling costs to make products floor-ready to customer specifications, write downs for inventory obsolescence and since June 2004 overhead costs associated with our quick turn, Special Make-Up Shop. No cost of goods sold is
associated with license revenues. We do not include our distribution facility costs in the calculation of the cost of goods sold, but rather include these costs as a component of our selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result, our
gross profit may not be comparable to that of other companies that include distribution facility costs in the calculation of their cost of goods sold. We believe, however, that our distribution facility costs have not been of a sufficient magnitude
to materially affect our gross margin for purposes of comparison.

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of marketing
costs, selling costs, payroll and related costs (excluding those specifically related to marketing and selling) and other corporate costs. Our marketing costs are an important driver of our growth and throughout the year we manage our marketing
costs to be within a certain percentage of net revenues. Marketing costs include payroll costs specific to marketing,


commercials, print ads, league and player sponsorships and depreciation expense specific to our in-store fixture program. Selling costs consist primarily of
payroll costs specific to selling and commissions paid to third parties. Other corporate costs consist primarily of distribution and corporate facility costs and other Company-wide administrative expenses. Due to our significant growth year over
year, our selling general and administrative expenses have increased proportionately to support our growth and new sales initiatives. A majority of any leverage experienced in selling, general and administrative expenses is expected to be reinvested
into the Company.

Since becoming a “C” corporation effective January 2002, we have benefited from certain state tax credits,
which reduced the state portion of our provision for income taxes. For 2005, we have fully earned all existing available state income tax credits and therefore we expect our 2006 effective tax rate to approximate 41.5%.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth
key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues.


Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

Net revenues

increased $75.9 million, or 37.0%, to $281.1 million in 2005 from $205.2 million in 2004. This increase was the result
of increases in both our net sales and license revenues as noted in the product category table below.

Net sales

increased $70.4 million, or 35.1%, to $271.3 million in 2005 from
$200.9 million in 2004 as noted in the table above. The increases in the mens, womens and youth product categories noted above primarily reflect:

•

continued unit volume growth of our existing products sold to retail customers, while pricing of existing products remained relatively unchanged; and

•

new products introduced in 2005 accounted for $29.0 million of the increase in net sales which included the Metal series, Under Armour Tech-T line and our performance hooded
sweatshirt for mens, womens and youth, and our new women’s Duplicity sports bra.

License revenues

increased
$5.5 million to $9.8 million in 2005 from $4.3 million in 2004. This increase in license revenues was a result of increased sales by our licensees due to increased distribution, continued unit volume growth and new product offerings.

Gross profit

increased $40.5 million to $135.9 million in 2005 from $95.4 million in 2004. Gross profit as a percentage
of net revenues, or gross margin, increased 180 basis points to 48.3% in 2005 from 46.5% in 2004. This net increase in gross margin was primarily driven by the following:

•

a 70 basis point increase due to the $5.5 million increase in license revenues;

•

a 240 basis point increase due to lower product costs as a result of greater supplier discounts for increased volume and lower cost sourcing arrangements;

•

a 50 basis point decrease driven by larger customer incentives, partially offset by more accurate demand forecasting and better inventory management; and

•

a 70 basis point decrease due to higher handling costs to make products to customer specifications for immediate display in their stores and higher overhead costs associated with
our quick-turn, Special Make-Up Shop, which was instituted in June 2004.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased $29.9 million, or 42.7%, to $100.0 million in 2005 from $70.1 million in 2004. As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 35.6% in 2005 from 34.1% in 2004. This net increase was primarily
driven by the following:

•

Marketing costs increased $8.7 million to $30.5 million in 2005 from $21.8 million in 2004. The increase in these costs was due to increased advertising costs from our women’s
media campaign, marketing salaries, and depreciation expense related to our in-store fixture program. As a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs increased slightly to 10.9% in 2005 from 10.6% in 2004 due to the increased costs described above.


•

Selling costs increased $5.4 million to $17.1 million in 2005 from $11.7 million in 2004. This increase was due to increased headcount in our sales force and startup costs
associated with our international growth initiatives. As a percentage of net revenues, selling costs increased to 6.1% in 2005 from 5.7% in 2004 due to the increased costs described above.

•

Payroll and related costs (excluding those specifically related to marketing and selling) increased $8.6 million to $26.9 million in 2005, from $18.3 million in 2004. The increase
during 2005 was due to the following initiatives: we began to build our team to design and source our footwear line, which we expect to offer for the fall 2006 season, we added personnel to our information technology team to support our Company-wide
initiative to upgrade our information systems, we incurred equity compensation costs, we added personnel to operate our 3 new retail outlet stores, and we invested in the personnel needed to enhance our compliance function and operate as a public
company. As a percentage of net revenues, payroll and related costs (excluding those specifically related to marketing and selling) increased to 9.6% in 2005 from 8.9% in 2004 due to the items described above.

•

Other corporate costs increased $7.2 million to $25.5 million in 2005, from $18.3 million in 2004. This increase was attributable to higher costs in support of our footwear
initiative, freight and duty related to increased Canada sales, expansion of our leased corporate office space and distribution facility, and necessary costs associated with being a public company. As a percentage of net revenues, other corporate
costs were 9.1% in 2005, which is a slight increase from 8.9% in 2004 due to the items noted above.

Income from
operations

increased $10.5 million, or 41.4%, to $35.9 million in 2005 from $25.4 million in 2004. Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 12.7% in 2005 from 12.4% in 2004. This increase was a result of
an increase in gross margin partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues.

Interest expense, net

increased $1.6 million to $2.9 million in 2005 from $1.3 million in 2004. This increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings and a higher effective interest rate under our revolving
credit facility prior to being repaid in November 2005 with proceeds from the initial public offering.

Provision for income taxes

increased $5.5 million to $13.3 million in 2005 from $7.8 million in 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005 our effective tax rate was 40.2% compared to 32.3% in 2004. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our
effective state tax rate, which reflected reduced state tax credits earned as a percentage of income before taxes.

Net income

increased $3.4 million to $19.7 million in 2005 from $16.3 million in 2004, as a result of the factors described above.

Year Ended
December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Net revenues

increased $89.8 million, or 77.8%, to
$205.2 million in 2004 from $115.4 million in 2003. The increase was a result of increases in both our net sales and license revenues as noted in the product category table below.


Net sales

increased $87.1 million, or 76.6%, to $200.9 million in 2004 from
$113.8 million in 2003 as noted in the table above. The increases in mens, womens and youth product categories noted above primarily reflect:

•

unit volume growth driven largely by increased sales to the military and law enforcement as well as increased sales in Canada, while the pricing of our existing products remained
relatively unchanged; and

•

the introduction of new products, including men’s compression and running shorts, a line of men’s fleece, athletic gloves, a women’s sports bra and women’s
seamless underwear. These new products collectively accounted for $17.1 million of the increase in net sales.

License revenues

increased $2.6 million to $4.3 million in 2004 from $1.7 million in 2003. The increase in license revenues was primarily a result of increased sales by our domestic licensees.

Gross profit

increased $44.7 million to $95.4 million in 2004 from $50.7 million in 2003. Gross profit as a percentage of net
revenues, or gross margin, increased 260 basis points to 46.5% in 2004 from 43.9% in 2003. This net increase in gross margin was primarily driven by the following:

•

a 200 basis point increase due to more accurate demand forecasting and better inventory management;

•

a 100 basis point increase due to lower costs paid to our overseas manufacturers for our products as a result of volume discounts;

•

a 30 basis point increase related to the $2.6 million increase in license revenues; and

•

a 40 basis point decrease due to higher overhead costs associated with our quick-turn, Special Make-Up Shop.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased $29.4 million, or 72.1%, to $70.1 million in 2004 from $40.7 million in 2003. As a
percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 34.1% in 2004 from 35.3% in 2003. This net increase was primarily driven by the following:

•

Marketing costs increased $8.1 million to $21.8 million in 2004 from $13.7 million in 2003. The increase was attributable to higher headcount, along with increased depreciation
expense related to our in-store fixture program. Marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 10.6% of net revenues in 2004 from 11.9% in 2003 as we were able to leverage these costs with our growth in revenues.

•

Selling costs increased $5.1 million to $11.7 million in 2004 from $6.6 million in 2003. The increase in selling costs was attributable to increased headcount and sales commissions.
As a percentage of net revenues, selling costs stayed consistent at 5.7% in 2004 and 2003.

•

Payroll and related costs (excluding those specifically related to marketing and selling) increased $7.5 million to $18.3 million in 2004 from $10.8 million in 2003. The increase
was attributable to an increase in headcount to support our growth. As a percentage of net revenues, payroll and related costs (excluding those specifically related to marketing and selling) decreased to 8.9% in 2004 from 9.4% in 2003 as we were
able to experience leverage from our growth in net revenues during 2004.

•

Other corporate costs increased $8.7 million to $18.3 million in 2004 from $9.6 million in 2003. This increase was due to increased distribution and corporate facility costs to
support our growth. Due to these increased costs, as a percentage of net revenues, other corporate costs increased to 8.9% in 2004 from 8.3% in 2003.

Income from operations

increased $15.4 million, or 155.0%, to $25.4 million in 2004 from $10.0 million in 2003. Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 12.4% in 2004
from 8.6% in 2003. This increase was a result of the increase in gross margin and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the year as noted above.


Interest expense, net

decreased $0.9 million to $1.3 million in 2004 from
$2.2 million in 2003. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to our redemption of high-interest bearing subordinated debt with proceeds received from the sale of equity in the third quarter of 2003.

Provision for income taxes

increased $5.8 million to $7.8 million in 2004 from $2.0 million in 2003, resulting in an effective tax
rate of 32.3% in 2004 compared to 25.7% in 2003. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our effective state tax rate, which reflected reduced state tax credits earned as a percentage of income before taxes.

Net income

increased $10.6 million to $16.3 million in 2004 from $5.7 million in 2003, as a result of the factors above.

Seasonality

Historically, we have
recognized over 75% of our income from operations in the third and fourth quarters of the year, driven by increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality
of our higher priced ColdGear line. Approximately 62% and 66% of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. We
generally expect inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season. Accordingly, we tend to have higher levels of receivables in the third and fourth quarters
and higher levels of cash in-flows from these receivables in the first and fourth quarters. Nonetheless, we believe that our seasonality in recent years may have been somewhat overstated due to our significant growth in net revenues.

The following table sets forth certain unaudited financial information for the periods indicated. The data is prepared on the same basis as the audited
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. All recurring, necessary adjustments are reflected in the data below.

Financial Position, Capital Resources and Liquidity

Our cash requirements have principally been for working capital and capital expenditures. Working capital has historically been funded from available
revolving credit facilities. Our working capital requirements reflect the seasonality and growth in our business as we recognize a significant increase in sales during the fall selling season. Cash requirements for capital investments needed to grow
our business have historically been funded through subordinated debt and capital lease obligations. Our capital investments have included expanding our in-store fixture program, improvements to our distribution and corporate facilities to support
our growth, and more recently, the investment in a Company-wide initiative to upgrade our information systems.

Cash and cash equivalents
increased to $63.0 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2004 and our working capital increased to $134.1 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $16.7 million at December 31, 2004. This
significant improvement in our financial position is the result of our


initial public offering. In November 2005, we issued an additional 9,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, which provided us with cash that we have
placed in highly liquid investments with maturities of less than three months. In addition to the initial public offering, our financial position also improved due to better inventory management when compared to the increase in net revenues.

We believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings available to us under our senior secured credit and subordinated debt
facilities, together with the net proceeds from the initial public offering, will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.

Cash Flows

The following table presents the major
components of net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended:

Operating Activities

Operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, deferred income taxes, provision for doubtful accounts and other discounts and the effect of changes in
operating assets and liabilities, principally accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Cash provided by
operating activities increased $24.6 million to $15.8 million in 2005 compared to cash used in operating activities of $8.9 million in 2004. The increase was due to an increase in net operating income and non-cash items of $3.4 million and $5.5
million, respectively, coupled with lower cash outflows from operating assets and liabilities of $15.7 million. Non-cash items increased primarily as a result of higher depreciation and amortization from the acquisition of additional assets and
current period stock compensation. The net decrease in cash outflows from operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of improved inventory management due to better forecasting of sales and delivery of inventory which reduced the build
up of inventory levels year over year. Cash outflows from income taxes payable increased due to higher federal and state income tax payments during 2005 compared to tax payments made during 2004 and cash outflows from accrued expenses increased due
to higher bonus payments during 2005 compared to 2004.

Net cash used in operating activities was $8.9 million and $9.7 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net cash outflows primarily related to the buildup of inventories in anticipation of increased net sales in the spring and summer seasons, coupled with higher accounts receivable due to
higher net sales as compared to prior years. These cash outflows were partially offset by higher net income; increases in depreciation and amortization from the acquisition of additional assets; higher levels of allowances for doubtful accounts and
discounts from the increased levels of accounts receivable; and increases in accounts payable due to our suppliers from higher inventory levels.

Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities, which primarily represents capital expenditures, increased $2.2
million to $10.8 million in 2005 from $8.7 million in 2004. This increase in cash used in investing activities represents the


initial costs of our new enterprise resource system, or ERP, the continued investment in our in-store fixture program, enhancements to the distribution
facility and the buildouts of three additional retail outlet stores. Cash used in investing activities for 2004 and 2003 were $8.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Capital expenditures over these two years were due to the expansion
of our distribution center, the creation of the quick turn, Special Make-Up Shop, investing in our in-store fixture program, expansion of space related to our corporate headquarters, and the build-out of our first two retail outlet stores.

In June 2004, we moved our distribution facility to Glen Burnie, Maryland, approximately 15 miles from our Baltimore, Maryland
headquarters. As a result of the improvements already made to the facility and the excess available space, we believe the building will be adequate to meet our needs for the next several years.

As noted above, we entered into an agreement to license a new ERP system to support our growth. We have also signed an agreement with a consulting firm
as implementation partner of the ERP system. Implementation began in July 2005, and we expect to commence utilization of the system in 2006. Our total capital investment in connection with the implementation is expected to be approximately
$10.5 million over a five-year period.

Total capital investments were $13.0 million, $13.9 million and $3.5 million in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. Because we finance some capital investments through capital leases, total capital investments exceed capital expenditures as described above. Anticipated capital investments for 2006 are $15.0 - $16.0 million representing $8.0
million in our in-store fixture program, $4.0 million in a Company-wide initiative to upgrade our information systems, $1.5 million in improvements to our distribution facility, and investments in additional retail outlet stores and other general
corporate needs.

Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities increased $39.0 million to $57.0 million in 2005 from $18.0 million in 2004. This increase was primarily the result of proceeds from our initial public offering in November 2005. Through this
initial public offering, we issued an additional 9,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and received $112.7 million in proceeds net of $10.8 million in stock issue costs. Proceeds from our initial public offering were used to repay a $25.0
million term note, to repay the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility of $12.2 million, and to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate of $12.0 million. In addition, cash inflows for the year were slightly offset by
dividend payments made earlier in the year of $5.0 million.

In 2004, financing activities provided $18.0 million in cash primarily
from borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility. In 2003, financing activities provided $11.9 million in cash primarily from the net proceeds from the sale of equity and borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility, partially
offset by dividends paid.

Revolving Credit Facility Agreement

In September 2005, we entered into an amended and restated financing agreement with The CIT Group/Commercial Services, Inc (“CIT”), as agent for itself and other lenders, Wachovia Bank, National
Association, as documentation agent, and Sun Trust Bank, as syndication agent. The agreement comprised both a $25.0 million term note and a $75.0 million revolving credit facility. With proceeds from our initial public offering, the term note of
$25.0 million was repaid and terminated. The outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility, or $12.2 million, was also repaid.

We currently have available borrowings of up to $75.0 million through 2010 under the revolving credit facility based on our eligible inventory and accounts receivable balances. We have the option to increase the size of the revolving credit
facility up to $100.0 million if certain conditions are satisfied including compliance with certain financial covenants. The revolving credit facility bears interest based on the monthly average daily balance outstanding at our option of either
LIBOR plus an applicable margin (varying from 1.75% to 3.00%) or JP Morgan Chase Bank’s prime rate plus an applicable margin (varying from -0.75% to 0.50%). The applicable


margin is calculated quarterly and varies based on certain of our financial ratios as defined in the agreement. The revolving credit facility also carries a
line of credit fee for available but unused borrowings which can vary from 0.13% to 0.63% based on certain of our ratios as defined in the agreement.

This agreement contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to borrow money; pledge our accounts receivable, inventory, intellectual property and most of our other assets as security
in our borrowings or transactions; pay dividends on stock; redeem or acquire any of our securities; sell certain assets; make certain investments; guaranty certain obligations of third parties; undergo a merger or consolidation; or engage in any
activity materially different from those presently conducted by us.

This agreement also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce
the valuation of our inventory and receivables and thereby reduce our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility even if we are in compliance with all conditions of the agreement. In addition, we are required to comply with certain
financial covenants in the event we fail to maintain a minimum borrowing availability of $15.0 million. These covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. Failure to comply with any of
the covenants under our revolving credit facility could result in a default under the facility. This could cause the lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on essentially all of our assets, which would have a material
adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, because our revolving credit facility bears interest at variable interest rates, which we do not anticipate hedging against, increases in interest rates
would increase our cost of borrowing, resulting in a decline in our net income and cash flow, which could cause the price of our Class A Common Stock to decline. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2005.

Subordinated Debt and Lease Obligations

In March 2005, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Sun Trust Bank to finance the acquisition of up to $17.0 million of qualifying capital investments. This agreement is collateralized by a first lien on these assets and
is otherwise subordinate to the revolving credit facility. Through December 31, 2005, we have financed $5.8 million of capital investments under this agreement. Interest on outstanding borrowings accrues at an average rate of 5.9%. At
December 31, 2005, the outstanding principal balance was $4.7 million.

In December 2003, we entered into a master loan and
security agreement with Wachovia Bank N.A. which is subordinate to the revolving credit facility. Under this agreement, we borrowed $1.3 million for the purchase of qualifying furniture and fixtures. This agreement bears interest at 7.0% annually,
and principal and interest payments are due monthly through February 2006. At December 31, 2005, the outstanding principal balance was $96,000 which has been repaid in 2006.

We continually lease warehouse space, office facilities, space for our retail outlet stores and certain equipment under non cancelable operating and
capital leases.

Contractual Commitments and Contingencies

We lease certain buildings and equipment under non-cancelable capital and operating leases. The leases expire at various dates through 2010, excluding extensions at our option, and contain various provisions for
rental adjustments. The operating leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time. Our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 are summarized in the following table:


(1)

Excludes required interest payments.

(2)

We establish relationships with individual athletes and teams in order to promote our brand. Some of these agreements provide for additional incentives based on performance
achievements while wearing or using our products. It is not possible to determine the amounts we may be required to pay under these agreements as they are subject to variables. The amounts listed above are the known amounts required to be paid under
these contracts.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or financing activities with special-purpose entities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. To prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates also affect our reported
revenues and expenses. Judgments must be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities as well. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses the critical accounting
policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results.

Revenue Recognition

Net sales are
recognized upon the transfer of title and risk of ownership to customers and are recorded net of discounts, customer-based incentives and returns. Transfer of title and risk of ownership are based upon shipment under free on-board (FOB)
shipping-point contract terms for most goods. In some instances, transfer of title and risk of ownership takes place at the point of sale (e.g. at the Company’s retail outlet stores). Provisions for sales discounts earned and customer-based
incentives are based on contractual obligations with customers. Returns are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience. License revenues are recognized based upon shipment of licensed products sold by our licensees.

Sales Returns, Allowances and Discounts

We record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances and discounts. We base our
estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns and allowances that have not yet been received by us. We record reductions to gross sales for customer-based incentives,
which include volume-based discounts and cooperative advertising credits. We base our estimates for customer returns, allowances and discounts primarily on anticipated sales volume throughout the year. The actual amount of customer returns,
allowances and discounts, which is inherently uncertain, may differ from our estimates. If we determined that actual or expected returns, allowances or discounts were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would
record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which we made such a determination.

Reserve for
Uncollectible Accounts Receivable

We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In
determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Because we cannot predict future changes in the
financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve
might be required. In the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate, we would record a charge to selling, general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination. The risk associated with
uncollectible accounts receivable is mitigated by our Credit Approved Receivables Agreement. Under this agreement, we have the ability to transfer credit risk for certain customers approved by the lender. Within these


customers, we specifically identify individual invoices (“Approved Receivables”), up to a customer-specific maximum amount, for credit risk
coverage. We incur a fee for the amount of Approved Receivables to be covered. Only upon the financial inability of a covered customer to pay such invoices, and subject to us maintaining certain collection and reporting procedures, will the credit
risk associated with the Approved Receivables be transferred to the lender. Historically, we have not transferred such credit risk on any Approved Receivables. As such, no sales of receivables have ever been made to our lender under the Credit
Approved Receivables Agreement.

Inventory Valuation and Reserves

We value our inventory at standard costs which approximates the
lower of cost or market, using the first-in, first-out method of cost determination. Market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions. If we determine that the estimated market value of our
inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory, we provide a reserve for such difference as a charge to cost of goods sold. If actual market conditions are more or less favorable than those projected by us, further adjustments may be
required that would decrease or increase, as applicable, our cost of goods sold in the period in which they were recorded.

Long-Lived
Assets

The acquisition of long-lived assets, including furniture and fixtures, office equipment and software, plant equipment, leasehold improvements, computer hardware and software and in-store fixtures, is recorded at cost and this cost
is depreciated over the asset’s estimated useful life. We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining
balance may not be recoverable. These factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans or changes in anticipated cash flows. When factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible
impairment, we review long-lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using discounted cash flows. Impairments are recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value.

Income Tax Provision

We estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full year and record a quarterly income tax provision in
accordance with the anticipated effective annual tax rate. As the year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual process periodically results in a change to
our expected effective tax rate for the year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date provision equals the expected annual rate.

Stock-Based Compensation

We have not elected the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS 123”) as amended by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-based Compensation Transition and Disclosure,

(“SFAS 148”), for stock-based compensation granted to
employees and directors. We apply Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”) and related interpretations in accounting for stock-based compensation to
employees and directors. In accordance with APB 25, we do not recognize compensation expense for grants of stock rights to employees with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair market value of common stock at the date of the grant.
Compensation expense associated with grants of stock rights with fair market value in excess of the exercise price is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses ratably over the vesting period in accordance with Financial
Interpretation Number (“FIN”) 28,

Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans

(“FIN 28”). We recognized approximately $855,000 in compensation expense under APB 25 for the
year ended December 31, 2005. We account for grants of stock rights to non-employees at fair value in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 96-18,

Accounting for Equity
Instruments That are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services

(“EITF 96-18”). For the year ended December 31, 2005,we recognized consulting expense of approximately $322,000
related to grants of stock rights to non-employees. No compensation or consulting expense was recognized for grants of stock rights to non-employees or employees during the years ended December 31, 2004 or 2003.


New Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Staff Position No. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) 13-1,

Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During
a Construction Period

(“FSP SFAS 13-1”). FSP SFAS 13-1 concludes that there is no distinction between the right to use a leased asset during and after the construction period; therefore rental costs incurred during the construction
period should be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations. FSP SFAS 13-1 is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005; early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt FSP SFAS
13-1 in the first quarter of 2006 and does not expect FSP SFAS 13-1 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 05-6,

Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements

(“EITF 05-6”). EITF 05-6 addresses the amortization period for leasehold improvements in operating
leases that are either (a) placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the initial lease term or (b) acquired in a business combination. Leasehold improvements that are placed in service
significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably
assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. Leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and
renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition. This Issue was applied to leasehold improvements that were purchased or acquired in reporting periods after June 29, 2005. The application of EITF 05-6 did not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections

, (“SFAS 154”) which replaces APB Opinion No. 20,

Accounting Changes

, and SFAS No. 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements

. SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary
changes in accounting principle and requires retrospective application (a term defined by the statement) to prior periods’ financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine the effect of a change. It also applies to changes required
by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We plan to adopt SFAS 154 in the
first quarter of fiscal 2006.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123-revised 2004,

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123R”), which replaces SFAS 123, and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires all stock-based compensation to be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such cost be measured according to the fair
value of the award. SFAS 123R will be effective for our first quarter of 2006. We currently account for grants of stock rights in accordance with APB 25 and provide pro forma effects of SFAS 123 in accordance with SFAS 148. In March 2005, Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 107,

Share Based Payment,

(“SAB 107”) was issued to provide guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission to simplify some of the implementation challenges of SFAS 123R as this statement relates
to the valuation of the share based payment arrangements for public companies. We will apply the principles of SAB 107 in connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R. We are currently evaluating the effect of SFAS 123R and SAB 107 on our
consolidated financial statements with the intent of implementing this standard in the first quarter of 2006.

In November 2004, FASB
issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs

(“SFAS 151”) which is an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 43(“ARB 43”),

Inventory Pricing

. SFAS 151 amends ARB 43 to clarify
abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as current-period charges. This statement also requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be
based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of this statement in the first quarter of 2006 will have a material effect on our
consolidated financial statements.


Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Foreign Exchange

We currently generate a small amount
of our net revenues in Canada and the United Kingdom. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is U.S. dollars. To date, net revenues generated outside of the United States have not been significant. As a result, we have not
been impacted materially by changes in exchange rates and do not expect to be impacted materially for the foreseeable future. However, as our net revenues generated outside of the United States increase, our results of operations could be adversely
impacted by changes in exchange rates. For example, if we recognize international sales in local foreign currencies (as we currently do in Canada), as the U.S. dollar strengthens it would have a negative impact on our international results upon
translation of those results into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. We do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations and do not intend to do so for the foreseeable future.

Inflation

Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may
adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability
to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.

1. Description of the Business

Under Armour, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a developer,
marketer and distributor of branded performance products for men, women and youth under the label Under Armour

®

. Sales are targeted to athletes and teams at the collegiate and professional level as well as consumers with active lifestyles primarily in North America.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of inception to be cash equivalents.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that subject the Company to significant
concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. The majority of the Company’s accounts receivable is due from large sporting good retailers. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial
condition and collateral is not required. The Company is party to a Credit Approved Receivables Agreement. Under this agreement, the Company has the ability to transfer credit risk for certain customers approved by the lender. Within these
customers, the Company specifically identifies individual invoices (“Approved Receivables”), up to a customer-specific maximum amount, for credit risk coverage. The Company incurs a fee for the amount of Approved Receivables to be covered.
Only upon the financial inability of a covered customer to pay such invoices, and subject to the Company maintaining certain collection and reporting procedures, will the credit risk associated with the Approved Receivables be transferred to the
lender. Historically, the Company has not transferred such credit risk on any Approved Receivables. As such, no sales of receivables have ever been made to its lender under the Credit Approved Receivables Agreement.

The Company depends on certain large sporting good retailers for a majority of its net sales, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from
any of these customers would likely significantly reduce revenues. Customers that accounted for more than 10% of net revenues and accounts receivable are as follows:


Under Armour, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share amounts)

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoice price net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, discounts, and reserve for returns, and do not bear
interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. The Company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Receivable balances are written off
against the allowance when management believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.

Inventories

Inventories consist of
finished goods, raw materials and work-in-process, and are valued at standard costs which approximate the lower of cost or market, using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of cost determination. Costs of finished goods inventories
include all costs incurred to bring inventory to its current condition, including freight-in, duties and other costs. The Company does not include certain costs incurred to operate its distribution center in cost of goods sold. Historically, such
costs have not had a material impact on inventories, cost of goods sold, or gross profit.

The Company periodically reviews its inventories
and makes provisions as necessary for estimated obsolescence or damaged goods. The amount of such markdown is equal to the difference between cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demands, selling
prices, and market conditions.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the
Company’s assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, in the judgment of the Company’s
management, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets: 3 to 7 years for furniture and fixtures, office equipment and software, and plant equipment and 5 years for automobiles. Amortization of leasehold improvements is provided over the
shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. The cost of in-store apparel fixtures are capitalized, included in furniture and fixtures and depreciated over 3 years.

Upon retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses for that period. Major additions and betterments are capitalized to the asset accounts while maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the lives of assets, are expensed
as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not


Under Armour, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share amounts)

be recoverable. These factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or changes in anticipated cash flows.
When factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using discounted cash flows. Impairments are recognized in earnings to the extent
that the carrying value exceeds fair value.

Accrued Expenses

At December 31, 2005, accrued expenses included $7,840 of accrued bonuses. At December 31, 2004, accrued expenses included $5,560 and
$5,000 of accrued bonuses and dividends, respectively.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax.

Currency Translation

The functional
currency for the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is the applicable local currency. The translation of the foreign currency into U.S. dollars is performed for assets and liabilities using current exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate during the period. Capital accounts are translated at historical exchange rates. Unrealized translation gains and losses are included in stockholders’ equity
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Adjustments that arise from exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are included in selling, general and administrative expenses as
realized gains and losses.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

, which summarizes certain of the SEC staff’s views
in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific
industry.

Net revenues consist of both net sales and license revenues. Net sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including
passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. Transfer of title and risk of ownership is based upon shipment under free on board (FOB) shipping-point for most goods. In some instances, transfer of title and
risk of ownership takes place at the point of sale (e.g. at the Company’s retail outlet stores). Net sales are recorded net of sales discounts and customer-based incentives and reserve for returns. Provisions for sales discounts and
customer-based incentives are based on contractual obligations with customers. Returns are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience. License revenues are recognized based upon shipment of licensed products sold by our licensees.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement related to such production costs is run. Media (television, print and
radio) placement costs are expensed the month the advertisement appears. In addition,


Under Armour, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share amounts)

advertising costs include sponsorship expenses. Accounting for sponsorship payments is based upon specific contract provisions. Generally, sponsorship
payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. Prepayments made under contracts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
Advertising expense was $30,465, $21,753 and $13,728 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2004, prepaid advertising costs were $279. No amounts were prepaid as of December 31, 2005.

Shipping and Handling Costs

The Company charges certain customers shipping and handling fees. These revenues are recorded in net revenues. The costs associated with shipping goods to customers from our distribution center are recorded in selling, general and
administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, these shipping costs were $3,590, $1,667 and $1,533, respectively.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing the net income available
to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share are computed by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all
potentially dilutive stock options and awards. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 03-06:

Participating Securities and the Two Class Method Under SFAS 128

(“EITF 03-06”), the
Convertible Common Stock held by Rosewood entities has been included in the basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, as if the shares were converted into Class A Common Stock on a 3-for-1
basis. The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share:

Stock-based Compensation

The Company accounts for grants of stock rights to non-employees at fair value in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123

Stock-based Compensation

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share amounts)

Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services

(“EITF
96-18”). For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized consulting expense of $322 related to grants of stock rights to non-employees. No consulting expense was recognized for grants of stock rights to non-employees during
the years ended December 31, 2004 or 2003.

The Company accounts for grants of stock rights to employees and directors using the
intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, (“APB 25”). Under the intrinsic value method, no compensation expense is
recognized if the exercise price is equal to or greater than the market price of the underlying stock right on the date of grant. Compensation expense associated with grants of stock rights with fair market values in excess of the exercise price are
recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses ratably over the vesting period in accordance with Financial Interpretation Number No. 28,

Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Options or Award Plans

(“FIN 28”). In 2005, the Company granted stock options with exercise prices below fair market value on the date of grant and issued shares of restricted Class A Common Stock. For the year ended December 31 2005, the
Company recorded unearned compensation of $2,645 and recognized compensation expense of $855 in accordance with FIN 28. No compensation expense was recognized related to grants of stock rights to employees during the years ended December 31,
2004 or 2003.

In accordance with SFAS 123 as amended by SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based-Compensation Transition and Disclosure

(“SFAS 148”), the Company has disclosed pro forma net income and net income per share information as if the Company accounted for grants of stock rights to employees and directors using the fair value method.


Under Armour, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share amounts)

The weighted average fair value of an option granted for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004, and 2003 was $1.57, $0.32 and $0.89, respectively. The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

Management Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

The carrying amounts shown for the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate their fair values because of the short term maturity of those instruments. The fair value of the long term debt approximates its carrying value based on the variable nature of interest rates and current market rates available to the
Company.

Guarantees and Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, the Company may enter into service agreements with service providers in which it agrees to indemnify the service provider against certain losses and liabilities arising from the
service provider’s performance under the agreement. Generally, such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which the service provider is grossly negligent, engages in willful misconduct, or acts in bad faith. The Company was
not aware of any liability under such service agreements for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

In October 2005, the Federal Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS 13-1,

Accounting for
Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period

(“FSP SFAS 13-1”). FSP SFAS 13-1 concludes that there is no distinction between the right to use a leased asset during and after the construction period; therefore rental costs
incurred during the construction period should be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations. FSP SFAS 13-1 is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005; early adoption is
permitted. The Company plans to adopt FSP SFAS 13-1 in the first quarter of 2006 and does not expect FSP SFAS 13-1 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In June 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 05-6,

Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements

(“EITF
05-6”). EITF 05-6 addresses the amortization period for leasehold improvements in operating leases that are either (a) placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at


Under Armour, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share amounts)

or near the beginning of the initial lease term or (b) acquired in a business combination. Leasehold improvements that are placed in service
significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably
assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. Leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and
renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition. This Issue was applied to leasehold improvements that were purchased or acquired in reporting periods after June 29, 2005. The application of EITF 05-6 did not
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections

, (“SFAS 154”) which replaces APB Opinion No. 20,

Accounting Changes

, and SFAS No. 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements

. SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary
changes in accounting principle and requires retrospective application (a term defined by the statement) to prior periods’ financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine the effect of a change. It also applies to changes required
by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company will adopt SFAS 154
in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123-revised 2004,

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123R”), which replaces SFAS 123, and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires all stock-based compensation to be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such costs be measured according to the fair
value of the award. SFAS 123R will be effective for the Company’s first quarter of 2006. The Company currently accounts for grants of stock rights in accordance with APB 25 and provides pro forma effects of SFAS 123 in accordance with SFAS 148
as discussed in Note 2 above. In March 2005, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107,

Share Based Payment,

(“SAB 107”) was issued to provide guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission to simplify some of the
implementation challenges of SFAS 123R as this statement relates to the valuation of the share based payment arrangements for public companies. The Company will apply the principles of SAB 107 in connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R. The
Company is currently evaluating the effect of SFAS 123R and SAB 107 on its consolidated financial statements with the intent of implementing this standard in the first quarter of 2006.

In November 2004, FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs

(“SFAS 151”) which is an amendment of Accounting Research
Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 43,

Inventory Pricing

. SFAS 151 requires all companies to recognize a current-period charge for abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs and wasted materials. This statement also
requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. While the Company does
not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, it plans to implement SFAS 151 during the first quarter of 2006.

3. Inventories

Inventories consisted of the following:

4. Property and Equipment

Property and equipment consisted of the following:

Construction in progress primarily includes software costs relative to systems not yet placed in
use and in-store fixtures not yet placed in service.

Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment was $6,224,
$3,165 and $1,024 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

5. Revolving Credit Facility and Long Term Debt

In September 2005, the Company entered into an amended and restated financing agreement with a lending institution which terminates in
2010. Under this financing agreement, the Company is required to maintain prescribed levels of tangible net worth as defined in the agreement. This financing agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company. The Company
paid and recorded $1,061 in deferred financing costs as part of the financing agreement which was comprised of both a $25,000 term note and a $75,000 revolving credit facility.

In November 2005, the Company repaid the $25,000 term note plus interest with proceeds from the initial public offering (see note 8). The term note
portion of the financing agreement was then terminated and as such


Under Armour, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share amounts)

the Company expensed $265 of deferred financing costs. With the termination of the term note, the Company’s trademarks and other intellectual property
were released as a component of the collateral. The weighted average interest rate on the term note was 9.4%.

The Company has available
borrowings under the revolving credit facility up to $75,000 based on the Company’s eligible inventory and accounts receivable balances. The revolving credit facility bears interest based on the monthly average daily balance outstanding at the
Company’s choice of either LIBOR plus an applicable margin (varying from 1.75% to 3.00%) or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime rate plus an applicable margin (varying from -0.75% to 0.50%). The applicable margin is calculated quarterly and varies
based on certain Company financial ratios as defined in the agreement. The revolving credit facility also carries a line of credit fee for available but unused borrowings which can vary from 0.13% to 0.63% also based on certain Company ratios as
defined in the agreement. The Company has the option to increase the borrowings under the revolving credit facility up to $100,000 if certain conditions are satisfied including the compliance with certain financial covenants. With proceeds from the
initial public offering in November 2005, the Company paid the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility which was $12,200. As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s availability was $74,740 based on to the Company’s
eligible inventory and accounts receivable balances. Any balance on the revolving credit facility must be repaid in full in 2010.

This
agreement contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to borrow money; pledge our accounts receivable, inventory, intellectual property and most of our other assets as security in our borrowings or transactions; pay
dividends on stock; redeem or acquire any of our securities; sell certain assets; make certain investments; guaranty certain obligations of third parties; undergo a merger or consolidation; or engage in any activity materially different from those
presently conducted by us.

This agreement also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce the valuation of our inventory and
receivables and thereby reduce our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility even if we are in compliance with all conditions of the agreement. In addition, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants in the event we fail
to maintain a minimum borrowing availability of $15,000, which the Company is in compliance of as of December 31, 2005.

Prior to
amending and restating the revolving credit facility in September 2005, the Company was party to a revolving credit facility that was to expire April 2007. From January 2004 through September 2005, this agreement was periodically amended to increase
the available borrowings based on eligible inventory and accounts receivable not to exceed $60,000. Interest rates and covenants under these superseded revolving credit facilities were similar to the interest rates and covenants described above.

The weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facilities for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
5.5%, 4.0% and 3.8%, respectively.

In March 2005, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement to finance the acquisition
of up to $17,000 of qualifying capital investments. This agreement is collateralized by a first lien on these assets and is otherwise subordinate to the revolving credit facility. Through December 31, 2005, the Company has financed $5,796 of
furniture and fixtures under this agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 5.89% for the year ended December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, the outstanding principal balance was $4,739. Principal payments due for
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 are $1,871, $1,959, $773, $95, and $41, respectively.


Under Armour, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share amounts)

In December 2003, the Company entered into a master loan and security agreement that is
subordinate to the revolving credit facility. Under this agreement the Company borrowed $1,250 for the purchase of qualifying furniture and fixtures. This agreement bears interest at 6.97% annually, and principal and interest payments are due
monthly through February 2006. At December 31, 2005, the outstanding principal balance was $96 which will be repaid in 2006. At December 31, 2004, the outstanding principal balance was $733.

In 2001 and again in 2003, the Company entered into subordinated debt agreements, each for $3,000 maturing June 2008 and April 2006, respectively.
Interest accrued from 13.5% through 20.0% per year. In September 2003, the Company repaid all principal and interest due under both of these subordinated debt agreements with proceeds from the sale of Convertible Common Stock held by Rosewood
entities and Series A Preferred Stock (see note 8).

Interest expense for all debt was $3,188, $1,290 and $2,220 for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005 and 2003, in connection with the repayment of debt, $265 and $99, respectively, in deferred financing costs were written off and included in interest expense. For the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 the Company amortized and included in interest expense $57, $48 and $15, respectively, of deferred financing costs.

6. Obligations under Capital and Operating Leases

The Company leases warehouse space, office facilities, space for our
retail outlet stores and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating and capital leases. The leases expire at various dates through 2010, excluding extensions at our option, and certain various provisions for rental adjustments.

The following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for capital and non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2005:

Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $3,237, $1,881 and
$898, respectively, under the operating lease agreements.


Under Armour, Inc. and Subsidiaries

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share amounts)

The following summarizes the Company’s assets under capital lease agreements:

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, $1,397, $1,195 and $630, respectively,
of depreciation and amortization on assets under capital leases have been included in depreciation expense.

7. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is, from time to time, involved in routine legal matters incidental to its business. Management believes that the ultimate
resolution of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Certain key executives are party to employment agreements with the Company that include severance benefits upon involuntary termination or change in ownership of the Company.

8. Stockholders’ Equity

In November 2005,
the Company completed an initial public offering and issued an additional 9,500,000 shares of common stock. As part of the initial public offering, 1,208,055 outstanding shares of Convertible Common Stock held by Rosewood entities were converted to
Class A Common Stock on a three-for-one basis. The Company received proceeds of $112,676 net of $10,824 in stock issue costs, which it used to repay the $25,000 term note, the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility of $12,200,
and the Series A Preferred Stock of $12,000.

As part of a recapitalization in connection with the initial public offering, the
Company’s stockholders approved an amended and restated charter that provides for the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0003 1/3 per share, and permits amendments to the charter without stockholder approval
to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock authorized, or the number of shares of stock of any class or series of stock authorized, and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of stock.

The amended and restated charter divides the Company’s common stock into two classes, Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common
Stock. Except as provided for in the future with respect to any other class or series of stock, the holders of our common stock possess exclusive voting power. Holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock have identical
rights, except that the holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B Convertible Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share on all matters submitted to stockholder vote. Class B Convertible
Common Stock may only


Under Armour, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share amounts)

be held by our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), or a related party of our CEO, as defined in the amended and restated charter. Shares not held by our CEO, or a
related party of our CEO, as defined in the amended and restated charter, automatically converts into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if authorized and
declared out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends.

The Company had previously amended its charter on
September 30, 2003, to authorize a second class of common stock, or Convertible Common Stock held by Rosewood entities, and a Series A Preferred Stock. The amended charter authorized 1,208,055 shares of $.001 par value Convertible Common Stock
held by Rosewood entities which the Company sold for $7,644 in cash proceeds before stock issue costs of $233. The Convertible Common Stock held by Rosewood entities had voting rights equal to the holders of the Class A Common Stock. The
Convertible Common Stock held by Rosewood entities was convertible into Class A Common Stock at any time on a three-to-one basis (as amended for the May 2005 stock split as described below) and was mandatory convertible into Class A Common
Stock on a three-to-one basis upon an initial public offering or upon a change in control as defined in the amended charter.

Board of
Directors

—In 2005, certain directors exercised their right as directors to purchase shares of restricted Class A Common Stock. The Company issued 131,070 shares of restricted Class A Common Stock which vests ratably over two
years. In the event of forfeiture the Company has the option to repurchase these restricted shares of Class A Common Stock at the original purchase price. This repurchase feature terminates at the end of the vesting period. The Company has
recorded unearned compensation of $99 and recognized $37 in compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2005,

Dividends

—

On December 31, 2004, cash dividends of $5,000 were declared, which approximated $0.14 per share on outstanding Class A Common Stock and $0.42 per share on outstanding Convertible Common Stock held by
Rosewood entities. At December 31, 2004, these dividends were included in accrued expenses and were subsequently paid in January 2005. On September 29, 2003, $3,640 in dividends were declared which approximated $0.12 per share on the
common stock outstanding on that date. These dividends were paid on December 31, 2003.

Stock Split—

In March 2005, a
3-for-1 stock split was approved for all authorized, issued, and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, with an effective date of May 3, 2005. All Class A Common Stock shares presented in the consolidated financial statements and
the notes to the consolidated financial statements have been restated to properly reflect the May 3, 2005 stock split.

Stockholders’ Agreements

—

In connection with the sale of the Convertible Common Stock held by Rosewood entities and the Series A Preferred Stock in September 2003, the Company, each holder of the Class A Common
Stock, and the holders of the Convertible Common Stock held by Rosewood entities, entered into a stockholders’ agreement. The stockholders’ agreement, among other things, prescribed certain limitations on the transfer of stock, granted the
Company and the holders of the Convertible Common Stock held by Rosewood entities rights of first refusal and co-sale rights with respect to sales of stock, and provided for voting rights with respect to the elections of Board of Directors under
certain circumstances. The stockholders’ agreements terminated upon the initial public offering.

On September 30, 2003, the
Company and certain key Class A Common Stock stockholders entered into buy-sell agreements that required the Company to repurchase the Class A Common Stock upon the death of the stockholders. The Company was required to maintain insurance
policies to redeem at least a portion of the Class A Common Stock outstanding. The Company determined that equity classification, as opposed to liability


Under Armour, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share amounts)

classification was appropriate for all shares subject to the buy-sell agreements. The Agreements were not freestanding agreements and the current termination
clauses (

i.e.

, change in control and initial public offering effectiveness) were substantive enough to render the death redemption feature of the agreements, which was generally thought to be a certain event, to be an uncertain event since
the contingent events were being considered at the time the agreements were signed. The Company also determined that permanent equity classification, as opposed to mezzanine presentation was appropriate, in accordance with EITF Topic D-98,

Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities

, since the shares subject to the repurchase feature were funded through insurance agreements maintained by the Company. The buy-sell agreements and insurance policies were terminated
upon the initial public offering.

Notes Receivable from Stockholder

—In 2005 and in 2000, the Company made loans to
select employees to enable these employees to exercise vested stock options. These notes receivable are presented within the balance sheet as a component of stockholders’ equity. These notes receivable are collateralized by the Class A
Common Stock and are full recourse to the Company. The 2005 notes receivable accrue interest at 7.7% and have a five year term at which time both principal and interest are due. The 2000 notes receivable, which accrued interest at 5.5%, were repaid
including interest in 2005 as part of the initial public offering.

9. Mandatorily Redeemable Series A Preferred Stock

On September 30, 2003, the Company issued 1,200,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $4,356 in cash proceeds net of $133 in stock issuance
costs. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock had limited voting rights and certain protective rights regarding major business decisions of the Company and the payment of dividends to common stockholders. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock did
have the ability to appoint one member to the Company’s Board of Directors.

The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock were entitled
to receive cumulative preferential dividends at 8% of the stated redemption value of $10 per share compounded annually if declared by the Board of Directors. The Series A Preferred Stock was redeemable at the option of the holders in September 2008
at a redemption price of $10 per share, plus 125% of accrued but unpaid dividends plus 25% of any previously declared dividends that were not paid within 120 days after the respective year end (the “Redemption Price”). The Series A
Preferred Stock also carried a liquidation preference equal to its stated Redemption Price and could be redeemed by the Company at any time at the then stated Redemption Price. The amount of the Redemption Price, including issuance costs, was being
accreted to the value of the Series A Preferred Stock each year. For the years ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, $5,307, $1,994 and $475, respectively, had been accreted to the Redemption price of the Series A Preferred Stock during the
period.

As required, the Series A Preferred Stock was redeemed at the $10 stated value per share, or $12,000, upon the initial public
offering.

10. Provision for Income Taxes

The components of the provision for income taxes consisted of the following:

A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate
is as follows:

Historically, the Company has benefited from certain state tax credits which reduced the state
portion of our provision for income taxes in 2005, 2004 and 2003. During 2005, the Company fully earned all existing available state tax credits and therefore the Company’s 2005 effective state tax rate increased.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share amounts)

As of December 31, 2005, the Company has available state tax credits of $2,391 that can be
carried forward for thirteen to fourteen year periods.

11. Stock Compensation Plans

2005 Stock Compensation Plan

Approved in November 2005, the 2005 Stock Compensation Plan (the
“2005 Plan”) provides for the issuance of 2,700,000 shares of stock rights to employees and non-employees. The 2005 Plan may be amended, suspended, or terminated, contingent on approval from our stockholders, as to any shares of stock as
to which awards have not been made.

The stock rights available under the 2005 Plan include incentive stock options, non-qualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, unrestricted stock grants, dividend equivalent rights and performance and annual incentive awards. Generally, grants of these stock rights vest ratably over a two to five
year period. The exercise period for all stock options generally may not exceed five years from the date of grant. The Company will generally receive a tax deduction for any ordinary income recognized by a participant in respect of an award under
the 2005 Plan. In the case of incentive stock options that meet certain holding period requirements, the grantee will not recognize ordinary income; therefore, the Company will not receive a deduction.

The 2005 Plan terminates in 2015, ten years after initiation. The 2005 Plan supersedes the 2000 Stock Compensation Plan (the “2000 Plan”) and
remaining shares available for issuance under the 2000 Plan were cancelled. As of December 31, 2005, 2,442,900 shares of stock rights are reserved and available to be granted under the 2005 Plan.

2000 Stock Compensation Plan

Approved in March 2000,
the 2000 Stock Compensation Plan (the “2000 Plan”) provided for the issuance of shares of stock rights to employees and non-employees. The 2000 Plan could be modified or terminated at any time, contingent on approval from stockholders
based on certain requirements, as to any shares of stock as to which awards have not been made. The 2000 Plan was terminated and superseded by the 2005 Plan upon the Company’s November 2005 initial public offering.

The stock rights available under the 2000 Plan previously included incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights and
restricted stock awards. Generally, grants of these stock rights vested ratably over a two to five year period. The exercise period for all stock options generally did not exceed five years from the date of grant. The Company generally did not
receive a tax deduction for any ordinary income recognized by a participant in respect of an award under the 2000 Plan. In the case of incentive stock options that meet certain holding period requirements, the grantee did not recognize ordinary
income; therefore, the Company did not receive a deduction.

12. Other Employee Benefits

The Company offers a 401(k) Deferred Compensation plan for the benefit of eligible employees. Employee contributions are voluntary and subject to Internal
Revenue Service limitations. The Company matches a portion of the participant’s contribution and recorded expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, of $382, $130 and $99, respectively. Shares of the Company’s
Class A Common Stock are not an investment option in this plan.

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan was approved in 2005 and allows for
the purchase of Class A Common Stock by all eligible employees at a 15% discount from fair market value subject to certain limits as defined in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. There are 1,000,000 shares reserved for future issuance under
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Employees will be able to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan beginning in 2006. In 2005, a Deferred Compensation Plan was approved. This plan allows a select group of management or highly compensated
employees, as requested by the employee and approved by the Compensation Committee, to make an annual base salary and/or bonus deferral for that specific year. The employee shall be vested in all amounts credited to his or her account, as of the
date such amounts are credited to such employee’s account. At December 31, 2005, no amounts are included on the balance sheet relating to this plan.

principles or practices or financial disclosure required to be reported under this Item.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Based on that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is
(1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most
recent quarter ended December 31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 by our fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. The evidence of such compliance is due no later than the time we file our annual
report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. We believe adequate resources and expertise, both internal and external have been put in place to meet this requirement. However, there is no guarantee that our efforts will result in a
management assurance, or an attestation by the independent auditors, that internal controls over financial reporting are adequate.
