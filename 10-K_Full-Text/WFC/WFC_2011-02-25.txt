BUSINESS

Wells Fargo & Company is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware and a financial holding
company and a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (BHC Act). Its principal business is to act as a holding company for its subsidiaries.
References in this report to “the Parent” mean the holding company. References to “we,” “our,” “us”
or “the Company” mean the holding company and its subsidiaries that are consolidated for financial
reporting purposes.

On December 31, 2008, we acquired Wachovia Corporation (Wachovia) in a transaction valued at $12.5
billion to Wachovia common stockholders. Wachovia, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, was one of
the nation’s largest diversified financial services companies, providing a broad range of retail
banking, asset and wealth management, and corporate and investment banking products and services to
customers through 3,300 financial centers in 21 states from Connecticut to Florida and west to
Texas and California. It also provided nationwide retail brokerage, mortgage lending and auto
finance businesses.

At December 31, 2010, we had assets of $1.3 trillion, loans of $757 billion, deposits of $848
billion and stockholders’ equity of $126 billion. Based on assets, we were the fourth largest bank
holding company in the United States. At December 31, 2010, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was the
Company’s principal subsidiary with assets of $1.1 trillion, or 88% of the Company’s assets.

At December 31, 2010, we had 272,200 active, full-time equivalent team members.

Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and
amendments to those reports, are available free at www.wellsfargo.com (select “About Us,” then
“Investor Relations – More,” then “More SEC Filings”) as soon as reasonably practicable after they
are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They
are also available free on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

We provide other financial services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses,
principally: wholesale banking, mortgage banking, consumer finance, equipment leasing, agricultural
finance, commercial finance, securities brokerage and investment banking, insurance agency and
brokerage services, computer and data processing services, trust services, investment advisory
services, mortgage-backed securities servicing and venture capital investment.

We have three operating segments for management reporting purposes: Community Banking; Wholesale
Banking; and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement. The 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders includes
financial information and descriptions of these operating segments.

Competition

The financial services industry is highly competitive. Our subsidiaries compete with financial
services providers such as banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies,
mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, and mutual fund companies. They also face
increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses, as well as from financial
services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies. Many of these competitors enjoy
fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures.

Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may
acquire banks and other financial institutions. Combinations of this type could significantly
change the competitive environment in which we conduct business. The financial services industry is
also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to
provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository
institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.



REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

We describe below, and in Notes 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions) and 25 (Regulatory and
Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements included in the 2010 Annual Report to
Stockholders, the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us. The description
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and
policies that are described. Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under
review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies, and a change
in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material effect
on our business. The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to
protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers and the banking system as a whole,
and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the Company.

Statutes, regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of
financial services, acquire depository institutions, and pay dividends on our capital stock. They
may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks, maintain
capital balances in excess of those desired by management, and pay higher deposit insurance
premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository
institutions. See the “Risk Factors” section in the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders for
additional information.

General

Parent Bank Holding Company.

As a bank holding company, the Parent is subject to regulation under
the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and supervision by its primary regulator, the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB). The Parent is also subject
to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. As a listed company
on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Parent is subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed
companies.

Subsidiary Banks.

Our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination
primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and also by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FRB. The foreign branches and representative offices of our
subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective foreign
financial regulators as well as by the OCC and the FRB. Our state-chartered banks are subject to
primary federal regulation and examination by the FDIC and, in addition, are regulated and examined
by their respective state banking departments.

Nonbank Subsidiaries.

Many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FRB
and other applicable federal and state agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to
regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies, as well as the FRB. Our brokerage
subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and, in
some cases, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and state securities regulators. Our other
nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government and/or
the various states as well as foreign countries in which they conduct business.



Parent Bank Holding Company Activities

“Financial in Nature” Requirement.

We became a financial holding company effective March 13, 2000.
We continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other FRB regulations.
As a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the
BHC Act, we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other
activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are
financial in nature. “Financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting, dealing and
market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency;
merchant banking; and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S.
Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity.
“Complementary activities” are activities that the FRB determines upon application to be
complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk.

FRB approval is not required for us to acquire a company (other than a bank holding company, bank
or savings association) engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to
activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior FRB approval is required
before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or
substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company, bank or savings association.

Because we are a financial holding company, if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under
the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), of less than satisfactory, we will be
prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better, from engaging in new activities
or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies, banks or savings associations, except
that we could engage in new activities, or acquire companies engaged in activities, that are
closely related to banking under the BHC Act. In addition, if the FRB finds that any of our
subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed, we would be required to enter into an
agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which
may contain additional limitations or conditions. Until corrected, we could be prohibited from
engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely
related to banking under the BHC Act without prior FRB approval. If we fail to correct any such
condition within a prescribed period, the FRB could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or,
in the alternative, to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking
under the BHC Act.

Interstate Banking

. Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Act (Riegle-Neal Act),
a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state
requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to
exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company not control, prior to or
following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured
depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial
entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount
set by the state).

The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate
branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states where
authorized under the laws of those states.



Regulatory Approval.

In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank
regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition,
financial condition, and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and
levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws
and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring
institution’s record of compliance under the CRA, and the effectiveness of the acquiring
institution in combating money laundering activities.

Dividend Restrictions

The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other
subsidiaries. A significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and
principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the Parent’s subsidiaries. Various federal and
state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent’s subsidiary
banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. Federal bank regulatory
agencies have the authority to prohibit the Parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or
unsound practices in conducting their businesses. The payment of dividends, depending on the
financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. The
ability of the Parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently, and could be
further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines. For information about the
restrictions applicable to the Parent’s subsidiary banks, see Note 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend
Restrictions) to Financial Statements included in the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders.

The Parent’s Board reduced its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.05 per share in second quarter
2009 to retain current period earnings and build common equity. As a participant in the Supervisory
Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), the Parent must consult with the Federal Reserve staff before
increasing the level of dividends. The FRB published clarifying supervisory guidance in first
quarter 2009,

SR 09-4 Applying Supervisory Guidance and Regulations on the Payment of Dividends,
Stock Redemptions, and Stock Repurchases at Bank Holding Companies,

pertaining to the FRB’s
criteria, assessment and approval process for reductions in capital. As with all 19 participants in
the SCAP, under this supervisory letter, before raising our common stock dividend, the Parent must
consult with the Federal Reserve staff and demonstrate that its actions are consistent with the
existing supervisory guidance, including demonstrating that its internal capital assessment process
is consistent with the complexity of its activities and risk profile. In November 2010, the FRB
updated the SR 09-4 guidance to require the original 19 SCAP participants, including the Company,
to submit a Capital Plan Review (CPR) proposal to the FRB no later than January 7, 2011. The
Company has submitted a CPR to the FRB that outlines proposed capital actions by the Company
including per share dividend increases and share repurchases from the Company’s benefit plans and
in the open market. The Company cannot guarantee whether or when the
FRB will approve its CPR or
what other conditions the FRB may impose on the Company in order for the Company to increase its
common stock dividend or repurchase shares.



Holding Company Structure

Transfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks.

The Parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions
under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries
to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called “covered
transactions.” In general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit,
investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of
value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an
exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to
10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with
affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus. Also, loans and
extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral. A
bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length
terms.

Source of Strength.

The FRB has a policy that a bank holding company is expected to act as a
source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate
circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be
required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support.

The OCC may order an assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its national bank
subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three
months, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the
deficiency.

Capital loans by the Parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to
deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, in the event of the
Parent’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain
the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a
priority of payment.

Depositor Preference.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) provides that, in the event of
the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of
depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors)
and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over
other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails,
insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of
unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the Parent, with respect to any extensions of credit
they have made to such insured depository institution.

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions.

All of the Company’s subsidiary banks are insured
by the FDIC. FDIC-insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or
reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an FDIC-insured depository
institution controlled by the same bank holding company, and for any assistance provided by the
FDIC to an FDIC-insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled
by the same bank holding company. “Default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or
receiver. “In danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating
that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.



Dodd-Frank Act

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), enacted on July 21,
2010, will result in broad changes to the U.S. financial system and is the most significant
financial reform legislation since the 1930s. Although much of the impact is not yet known, we
anticipate the Dodd-Frank Act will affect most of our businesses in some way, either directly
through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks,
capital or liquidity. At the enterprise level, the many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding
enhanced supervision and regulation of large banking organizations and other systemically
significant firms are expected to significantly increase our compliance and regulatory
requirements.

The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes or requires numerous rulemakings by federal regulatory agencies on a
wide range of topics including the enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically significant
firms; the establishment of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, the Financial Stability
Oversight Council, and the Office of Financial Research; the application of federal preemption on
national banks and their operating subsidiaries; the development of the FDIC’s orderly liquidation
authority for covered financial companies; the exclusion of trust preferred securities from
treatment as Tier 1 capital (the Collins Amendment); changes to the method of calculating FDIC
assessments; the adoption of a number of corporate governance and executive compensation reforms;
the regulation of debit card interchange fees (the Durbin Amendment); the regulation of swaps and
other derivative activities; the repeal of limits on the payment of interest on business deposit
accounts; changes to asset-backed securities markets; restrictions on proprietary trading by
financial institutions (the Volcker Rule); additional regulation of securities brokers and
investment advisers; and additional regulation of the residential mortgage business. Although a
number of rulemaking proposals have already been issued by regulatory agencies, the great majority
of the rulemakings required or authorized under the Dodd-Frank Act will not become effective until
well into 2011 or thereafter. We have done considerable analysis to estimate the level of
operational or compliance impact of these rulemakings on different parts of our organization.
However, in the absence of specific final rules we cannot quantify the financial impacts of these
rulemakings on the Company.

Capital Requirements

We are subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the FRB, which are
substantially similar to those imposed by the OCC and the FDIC on depository institutions within
their jurisdictions. Under these guidelines, a depository institution’s or a holding company’s
assets and certain specified off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various
risk categories. Tier 1 capital is considered core capital and generally includes common
stockholders’ equity, qualifying preferred stock, and trust preferred securities, and
noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, reduced by goodwill, net of related taxes,
certain intangible and other assets in excess of prescribed limitations, and adjusted for the
aggregate impact of certain items included in other comprehensive income. Total capital includes
Tier 1 capital, subordinated debt and other components that do not qualify for Tier 1 capital, and
the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to a specified percentage of risk-weighted assets. In
addition to measures of Tier 1 and Total capital, a further measure of capital, Tier 1 common
capital, reflects common equity and retained earnings, less goodwill and certain other deductions.



Under the Dodd-Frank Act, trust preferred securities will be excluded from the calculation of Tier
1 capital pursuant to a provision known as the Collins Amendment. We will be required to phase
existing trust preferred securities out of Tier 1 capital over three years beginning January 1,
2013. We expect proposed rules implementing the Collins Amendment to provide additional clarity
regarding the timing of the phase out.

National banks and bank holding companies currently are required to maintain Tier 1 and Total
capital equal to at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of their total risk-weighted assets (including
certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit). The risk-based capital rules
state that the capital requirements are minimum standards based primarily on broad credit-risk
considerations and do not take into account the other types of risk a banking organization may be
exposed to (e.g., interest rate, market, liquidity and operational risks). The FRB may, therefore,
set higher capital requirements for categories of banks (e.g. systematically important firms), or
for an individual bank as situations warrant. For example, holding companies experiencing internal
growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above
the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. For these
reasons, we are expected to operate with a capital position well above the minimum ratios, with the
amount of capital held to be determined by us through an internal capital assessment that
corresponds to our broad risk exposure.

The regulatory capital rules state that voting common stockholders’ equity should be the dominant
element within Tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on
non-common equity elements. During 2009, in conjunction with the FRB’s SCAP stress test process,
the ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets became significant as a measurement of
the predominance of common equity in Tier 1 capital. There is currently no mandated minimum ratio.

In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision published new international guidelines for
determining regulatory capital that are designed to be more risk sensitive than the existing
framework and to promote enhanced risk management practices among large, internationally active
banking organizations. The United States federal bank regulatory agencies each approved a final
rule similar to the international guidelines in November 2007. This advanced capital adequacy
framework is known as “Basel II,” and is intended to more closely align regulatory capital
requirements with actual risks. Basel II incorporates three pillars that address (a) capital
adequacy, (b) supervisory review, which relates to the computation of capital and internal
assessment processes, and (c) market discipline, through increased disclosure requirements.
Embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk strategy, measurement and management that relate
to credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. Banking organizations are required to enhance
the measurement and management of those risks through the use of advanced approaches for
calculating risk-based capital requirements. Basel II includes safeguards that include a
requirement that banking organizations conduct a parallel run over a period of four consecutive
calendar quarters for measuring regulatory capital under the new regulatory capital rules and the
existing general risk-based capital rules before solely operating under the Basel II framework; a
requirement that an institution satisfactorily complete a series of transitional periods before
operating under Basel II without floors; and a commitment by the federal bank regulatory agencies
to conduct ongoing analysis of the framework to ensure Basel II is working as intended. Following a
successful parallel run period, a banking organization would have to progress through three
transitional periods (each lasting at least one year), during which there would be floors on
potential declines in risk-based capital requirements as calculated under the current rules. Those
transitional floors provide for



maximum cumulative reductions of required risk-based capital of 5% during the first year of
implementation, 10% in the second year and 15% in the third year. A banking organization will need
approval from its primary Federal regulator to move into each of the transitional floor periods,
and at the end of the third transitional floor period to move to full implementation. Wells Fargo
is implementing the advanced approach under Basel II, and has established a project management
infrastructure to implement the regulations and enter the parallel run in 2012 with regulatory
approval. Our delayed entry into the parallel run phase was approved by the FRB in 2010 as a result
of our acquisition of Wachovia.

In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies have established minimum leverage (Tier 1 capital
to adjusted average total assets) guidelines for banks within their regulatory jurisdiction. These
guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banks that meet certain specified
criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and the
highest regulatory rating. Institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a
leverage ratio of 4%. Our Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio as of
December 31, 2010, are included in Note 25 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to
Financial Statements included in the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders. At December 31, 2010, the
Company and each of its subsidiary banks were “well capitalized” under the applicable regulatory
capital adequacy guidelines.

In July 2009, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision published an additional set of international
guidelines for review known as Basel III, which were finalized in December 2010. The additional
guidelines were developed in response to the financial crisis of 2008 - 2010 and address many of
the weaknesses identified in the banking sector as contributing to the crisis, including excessive
leverage, inadequate and low quality capital and insufficient liquidity buffers. Basel III
fundamentals:

•

raise the quality of capital so banks are better able to absorb losses on both a going
concern and gone concern basis;

•

increase the risk coverage of the capital framework, specifically for trading
activities, securitizations, exposures to off-balance sheet vehicles, and counterparty
credit exposures arising from derivatives;

•

raise the level of minimum capital requirements;

•

establish an international leverage ratio;

•

develop capital buffers; and

•

raise standards for the supervisory review process (Pillar 2) and public disclosures
(Pillar 3).

The U.S. regulatory bodies are reviewing the final Basel III international standards and final U.S.
rulemaking is expected to be completed in 2011. Although uncertainty exists regarding the final
U.S. rules, we have used our best efforts to interpret and estimate the effects of Basel III on our
capital ratios.

In December 2010, the FRB determined to conduct a second stress test survey of the 19 original SCAP
participants to forecast capital levels for financial institutions under a FRB-defined set of
adverse economic assumptions. The stress test survey also required us to provide forecasts under
two additional firm-defined scenarios and provide a list of capital actions, including dividend
increases, share repurchases, and securities redemptions, that the Company would pursue if results
of the stress test survey were approved by the FRB. The Company
submitted its CPR by the January 7,
2011 deadline. The Company cannot guarantee whether or when the FRB
will approve its CPR or what
other conditions the FRB may impose in order for the Company to pursue its proposed capital
actions.



From time to time, the FRB and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)
propose changes and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital guidelines and
related reporting instructions. In addition, the FRB has closely monitored capital levels of the
institutions it supervises during the ongoing financial disruption, and may require such
institutions to modify capital levels based on FRB determinations. Such determinations, proposals
or interpretations could, if implemented in the future, affect our reported capital ratios and net
risk-adjusted assets.

As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions,
the FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital safety and
soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The
standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure,
executive compensation and risk management. The agencies are authorized to take action against
institutions that fail to meet such standards.

The FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with
respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. A
depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will
depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors,
as established by regulation.

Deposit Insurance Assessments

Our bank subsidiaries, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., are members of the Deposit Insurance Fund
(DIF) maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits of our banks up to
prescribed limits for each depositor. The DIF was formed March 31, 2006, upon the merger of the
Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Insurance Fund in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance
Reform Act of 2005 (the Act). The Act established a range of 1.15% to 1.50% within which the FDIC
board of directors may set the Designated Reserve Ratio (reserve ratio or DRR). The Act also
granted the FDIC Board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured
institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio.

The Dodd-Frank Act gave the FDIC greater discretion to manage the DIF, raised the minimum DRR to
1.35% and removed the upper limit. In October 2010, the FDIC Board adopted a Restoration Plan to
ensure that the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the
Dodd-Frank Act. At the same time, the FDIC Board proposed a comprehensive, long-range plan for DIF
management. In December 2010, as part of the comprehensive plan, the FDIC Board adopted a final
rule to set the DRR at 2%, and in February 2011, the FDIC Board approved the remainder of the
comprehensive plan. The Restoration Plan foregoes a 3 basis point increase in the annual assessment
rates that was to take effect January 1, 2011.

To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on their deposits
(assessment base) and their institutional risk category (assessment rate). The FDIC determines an
institution’s risk category by combining its supervisory ratings with its financial ratios and
other risk measures. For large institutions (assets of $10 billion or more), the FDIC generally
determines risk by combining supervisory ratings, the institution’s long-term debt issuer ratings
and, beginning April 1, 2009, certain financial ratios.



In 2009, the FDIC undertook several measures in an effort to replenish the DIF. On February 27,
2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule modifying the risk-based assessment system and set new initial
base assessment rates beginning April 1, 2009. Rates range from a minimum of 12 cents per $100 of
domestic deposits for well-managed, well-capitalized institutions with the highest credit ratings,
to 45 cents per $100 for those institutions posing the most risk to the DIF. Risk-based adjustments
to the initial assessment rate may lower the rate to 7 cents per $100 of domestic deposits for
well-managed, well-capitalized banks with the highest credit ratings or raise the rate to 77.5
cents per $100 for depository institutions posing the most risk to the DIF. On May 22, 2009, the
FDIC adopted a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special assessment on each insured depository
institution’s assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. The amount of the special assessment
for any institution was limited to 10 basis points times the institution’s assessment base for the
second quarter 2009. On November 17, 2009, the FDIC amended its regulations to require insured
institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for fourth quarter 2009,
and all of 2010, 2011, and 2012. For purposes of determining the prepayment, the FDIC used the
institution’s assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009. The combined prepayment amount for
our banking subsidiaries was $3.9 billion, of which $2.6 billion remains available to offset future
assessments.

On February 7, 2011, the FDIC Board approved a final rule on assessments, dividends, assessment
base and large bank pricing that will take effect on April 1, 2011. The final rule approves the
comprehensive plan for DIF management that was proposed in October 2010; changes the assessment
base for all institutions from deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible
equity, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act; and modifies the risk-based assessment system for large
institutions. Under the final rule, risk categories and long-term debt issuer ratings are
eliminated as factors for determining an institution’s assessment rate. The new system combines
supervisory ratings and certain financial measures into two scorecards, one for most of the large
institutions and another for highly complex institutions (those that are very large and are
structurally and operationally complex or that pose unique challenges and risks in the case of
failure). The score received by an institution will be converted into an assessment rate for the
institution. The FDIC retains the ability to adjust the total score of large institutions based
upon quantitative or qualitative measures not adequately captured in the scorecards. We estimate
these changes will result in additional quarterly deposit insurance assessments of $40 million
(after tax) beginning with the second quarter of 2011.

All FDIC-insured depository institutions must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest
payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a federal corporation chartered under the
authority of the Federal Housing Finance Board. The bonds (commonly referred to as FICO bonds) were
issued to capitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FDIC-insured depository
institutions paid approximately 1.04 to 1.06 cents per $100 of assessable deposits in 2010. The
FDIC established the FICO assessment rate effective for first quarter 2011 at 1.02 cents annually
per $100 of assessable deposits. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company’s FDIC deposit
insurance assessments, including FICO assessments, totaled $1.2 billion.

The FDIC may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the
institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in
unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition
enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for
one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings,
depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved.



Fiscal and Monetary Policies

Our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the
federal government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which
regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Among the instruments of monetary
policy available to the FRB are (a) conducting open market operations in United States government
securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing
or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits, and (d) imposing or
changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These
methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank
loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The
policies of the FRB may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Privacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Restrictions on Cross-Selling

Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act), have
adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic
information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy
policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain
personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect
how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and
conveyed to outside vendors. Federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the Fair
and Accurate Credit Transactions Act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting
period, after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers, before information can be shared
among different affiliated companies for the purpose of cross-selling products and services between
those affiliated companies.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented a broad range of corporate governance
and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for
accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by
improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws. We are subject
to Sarbanes-Oxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and/or its implementing
regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit
committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors (including
restrictions on the types of non-audit services our auditors may provide to us), imposed additional
responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders, required our
management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over
financial reporting, and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over
financial reporting.



Patriot Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law
enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety
of fronts. The Patriot Act has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers,
dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act required us to
implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to anti-money laundering, compliance,
suspicious activities, and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. The
Patriot Act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in
combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition.

Future Legislation or Regulation

In light of recent conditions in the U.S. and global financial markets and the U.S. and global
economy, legislators, the presidential administration and regulators have increased their focus on
the regulation of the financial services industry. Proposals that could substantially intensify the
regulation of the financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be
introduced in the U.S. Congress, in state legislatures and from applicable regulatory authorities.
These proposals may change banking statutes and regulation and our operating environment in
substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, these proposals could increase our cost of doing
business, affect our compensation structure, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the
competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial
institutions. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the
effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our business, results of operations
or financial condition.

of the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders provides the quarterly prices of, and
quarterly dividends paid on, the Company’s common stock for the two-year period ended December 31,
2010, and is incorporated herein by reference. Prices shown represent the daily high and low, and
the quarter-end sale prices of the Company’s common stock as reported on the NYSE Composite
Transaction Reporting System for the periods indicated. At January 31, 2011, there were 201,714

DIVIDENDS

The dividend restrictions discussions on page 5 of this report and in the 2010 Annual Report to
Stockholders under “Financial Statements – Notes to Financial Statements – Note 3 (Cash, Loan and
Dividend Restrictions)” are incorporated into this item by reference.

REPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

In September 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 25 million shares of our
common stock. The authorization covered shares repurchased to meet team member benefit plan
requirements. The Company maintains a variety of retirement plans for its team members and
typically is a net issuer of shares of common stock to these plans. From time to time, it also
purchases shares of common stock from these plans to accommodate team member preferences. Share
repurchases are subtracted from the Company’s repurchase authority without offset for share
issuances. Shares may be repurchased as part of employee stock option exercises, from the different
benefit plans or in the open market, subject to regulatory approval.

The amount and timing of stock repurchases will be based on various factors, such as management’s
assessment of our capital structure and liquidity, the market price of our common stock compared to
management’s assessment of the stock’s underlying value, and applicable regulatory, legal and
accounting factors. In addition, repurchases in connection with employees surrendering shares to
exercise employee stock options will depend upon the amount and timing of those option exercises.
In June 2010, our Board of Directors also authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of warrants
to purchase our common stock. The warrants are listed on the NYSE under the symbol “WFCWS.” The
amount and timing of warrant repurchases will be based on various factors including market
conditions. See the “Capital Management” section in the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders for
additional information about our common stock and warrant repurchases.

Material Features of Equity Compensation Plans Not Approved by Stockholders

The 2003 SIP

. The amended and restated Wachovia Corporation 2003 Stock Incentive Plan
(2003 SIP) was originally approved by Wachovia’s shareholders in 2003 and prior to the merger had
been used for equity awards to Wachovia’s executive officers and other key employees. We assumed
the 2003 SIP in the merger and in February 2009 used substantially all remaining available shares
for stock option grants to legacy Wachovia team members. No awards have been granted since then,
and no future awards will be granted under the 2003 SIP.



At December 31, 2010, only options and stock awards in the form of RSAs were outstanding under the
2003 SIP. The options generally expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date and vest ratably
over a three-year period from the grant date. The option price is payable to us in full by methods
the Board’s Human Resources Committee (HRC) designates, including, but not limited to, in cash or
its equivalent, by tendering or withholding shares of our common stock having a fair market value
at the time of exercise equal to the total option price, or by a combination of the foregoing.
Unless the HRC determines otherwise or except as prohibited by applicable law, options may also be
exercised by a “cashless exercise” where the participant gives irrevocable instructions to a broker
to promptly deliver to us the amount of sale proceeds from the shares covered by the option
exercised, together with any withholding taxes due to the Company. The proceeds from any cash
payments upon option exercise are added to our general funds and used for general corporate
purposes. The outstanding RSAs vest upon the achievement of the specified performance criteria.
Prior to vesting, the holders of RSAs may exercise full voting rights with respect to those shares
and are entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to those
shares. Each participant’s award agreement will state the extent, if any, to which the participant
may receive unvested stock awards following termination of employment.

PartnerShares Plan

. We used the PartnerShares Stock Option Plan (PartnerShares) from
1996-2002 primarily for equity awards to team members not eligible for grants under the LTICP. The
plan was in effect at December 31, 2010, only as to the issuance of common stock upon exercise of
outstanding options. No future awards may be granted under the PartnerShares Plan.

Options under the PartnerShares Plan are exercisable at the closing share price of our common stock
as of the trading day immediately before the grant date. All options granted under the plan were
vested at December 31, 2010. Options are exercisable for ten years from the grant date or one year
from the participant’s death, whichever occurs first. If a participant leaves the Company other
than because of death, permanent disability or discharge for cause, the option terminates
immediately or three months after termination, as specified in the grant terms. If a participant is
discharged for cause, the option terminates immediately. Participants can pay the exercise price in
cash or by cashless exercise through a broker.

Deferred Compensation Plan

. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan eligible team members may
defer receipt of salary, bonuses and certain other compensation subject to the terms of the plan.
Deferral elections are irrevocable once made except for limited re-deferral opportunities. We treat
amounts deferred by a participant as if invested in the earnings options selected by the
participant, and determine the deferred compensation benefit payable to the participant based on
the performance of those earnings options. The plan offers a number of earnings options, including
one based on our common stock with dividends reinvested. We generally distribute amounts allocated
to the common stock option in shares of common stock. Participants have no direct interest in any
of the earnings options and are general unsecured creditors of the Company with respect to their
deferred compensation benefits under the plan.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Independent Contractors

. Under the
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Independent Contractors participants who perform
qualifying investment or other financial services for participating affiliates as independent
contractors may defer all or part of their eligible compensation payable to them by the affiliate
subject to the terms of the plan. Deferral elections are irrevocable once made. Amounts deferred by
a participant are treated as if



invested in the earnings options selected by the participant, which determine the deferred
compensation benefit payable to the participant. The plan offers a number of earnings options,
including one based on our common stock with dividends reinvested. We generally distribute amounts
allocated to the common stock option in shares of common stock. The plan is sponsored by a wholly
owned subsidiary, WF Deferred Compensation Holdings, Inc. We have guaranteed its obligations under
the plan. Participants have no direct interest in any of the earnings options and are general
unsecured creditors of the plan sponsor and the Company with respect to their deferred compensation
benefits under the plan.

Norwest Corporation Directors’ Formula Stock Award Plan

. Under the Norwest Corporation
Directors’ Formula Stock Award Plan we awarded shares of common stock to non-employee directors.
The plan allowed participants to defer receipt of all or a portion of their awards, with dividends
reinvested, until a future year or years as selected by the participants subject to the terms of
the plan. Participants can elect one time to defer commencement of distribution of their deferral
accounts if the election is made sufficiently in advance of the original distribution commencement
date and the new distribution commencement date is sufficiently beyond the original distribution
commencement date. Participants have no direct interest in the shares deferred under the plan and
are general unsecured creditors of the Company with respect to payment of their deferred stock
awards under the plan. No future stock awards or deferrals may be made under this plan.

Norwest Corporation Directors’ Stock Deferral Plan

. Under the Norwest Corporation
Directors’ Stock Deferral Plan a participating director could defer receipt of all or part of the
annual cash retainer and meeting fees payable to the director until a future year or years as
selected by the director subject to the terms of the plan. A participating director could elect
distribution of his or her deferral account in a lump sum in either cash or whole shares of common
stock, or a combination of both. Alternatively, the director could elect to receive the
distribution in up to ten annual installments of cash. A participant can elect one time to defer
commencement of distribution of his or her deferral account if the election is made sufficiently in
advance of the original distribution commencement date and the new distribution commencement date
is sufficiently beyond the original distribution commencement date. No future deferrals may be made
under this plan.
