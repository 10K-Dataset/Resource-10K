ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Wells Fargo & Company is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware and a financial holding
company and a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (BHC Act). Its principal business is to act as a holding company for its subsidiaries.
References in this report to “the Parent” mean the holding company. References to “we,” “our,” “us”
or “the Company” mean the holding company and its subsidiaries that are consolidated for financial
reporting purposes.

We are the product of the merger of Norwest Corporation and the former Wells Fargo & Company,
completed on November 2, 1998. On completion of the merger, Norwest Corporation changed its name to
Wells Fargo & Company. On December 31, 2008, we acquired Wachovia Corporation (Wachovia)  in a transaction valued at $12.5 billion to Wachovia
shareholders. Wachovia, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, was one of the nation’s largest
diversified financial services companies, providing a broad range of retail banking and brokerage,
asset and wealth management, and corporate and investment banking products and services to
customers through 3,300 financial centers in 21 states from Connecticut to Florida and west to
Texas and California, and nationwide retail brokerage, mortgage lending and auto finance
businesses.

We expand our business, in part, by acquiring banking institutions and other companies engaged in
activities that are financial in nature. We continue to explore opportunities to acquire banking
institutions and other financial services companies, and discussions related to possible
acquisitions may occur at any time. We cannot predict whether, or on what terms, discussions will
result in further acquisitions. As a matter of policy, we generally do not comment on any
discussions or possible acquisitions until a definitive acquisition agreement has been signed.

At December 31, 2008, we had assets of $1.3 trillion, loans of $865 billion, deposits of
$781 billion and stockholders’ equity of $99 billion. Based on assets, we were the fourth largest
bank holding company in the United States. At December 31, 2008, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was the
Company’s principal subsidiary with assets of $539 billion, or 41% of the Company’s assets. As part
of our acquisition with Wachovia, we also held the assets of Wachovia Bank, N.A., which totaled
$635 billion at December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2008, we had 158,900 active, full-time equivalent team members. With the
acquisition of Wachovia, we now have more than 281,000 active team members.

Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and
amendments to those reports, are available free at www.wellsfargo.com (select “About Us,” then
“Investor Relations – More,” then “SEC Filings”) as soon as reasonably practicable after they are
electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They are
also available free on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.



DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

General

We are a diversified financial services company. We provide retail, commercial and corporate
banking services through banking stores located in 39 states and the District of Columbia: Alabama,
Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska,
Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
We provide other financial services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses,
principally: wholesale banking, mortgage banking, consumer finance, equipment leasing, agricultural
finance, commercial finance, securities brokerage and investment banking, insurance agency and
brokerage services, computer and data processing services, trust services, investment advisory
services, mortgage-backed securities servicing and venture capital investment.

We have three operating segments for management reporting purposes: Community Banking, Wholesale
Banking and Wells Fargo Financial. The 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders includes financial
information and descriptions of these operating segments.

Competition

The financial services industry is highly competitive. Our subsidiaries compete with financial
services providers, such as banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies,
mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, and mutual fund companies. They also face
increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses, as well as from financial
services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies. Many of these competitors enjoy
fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures.

Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may
acquire banks and other financial institutions. Combinations of this type could significantly
change the competitive environment in which we conduct business. The financial services industry is
also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to
provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository
institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

We describe below, and in Notes 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions) and 26 (Regulatory and
Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements included in the 2008 Annual Report to
Stockholders, the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us. The description
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and
policies that are described. Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under
review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies, and a change
in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material effect
on our business. The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is



intended to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers and the banking system
as a whole, not investors in bank holding companies such as the Company.

Statutes, regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of
financial services, acquire depository institutions, and pay dividends on our capital stock. They
may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks, maintain
capital balances in excess of those desired by management, and pay higher deposit insurance
premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository
institutions.

General

Parent Bank Holding Company.

As a bank holding company, the Parent is subject to regulation under
the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and supervision by its primary regulator, the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB). The Parent is also subject
to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. As a listed company
on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Parent is subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed
companies.

Subsidiary Banks.

Our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination
primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and secondarily by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FRB. Our subsidiary federal savings banks are subject
to primary regulation and examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and secondarily by
the FDIC and the FRB. Our state-chartered banks are subject to primary federal regulation and
examination by the FDIC and, in addition, are regulated and examined by their respective state
banking departments.

Nonbank Subsidiaries.

Many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FRB
and other applicable federal and state agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to
regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies, as well as the FRB. Our brokerage
subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and, in
some cases, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and state securities regulators. FINRA was
formed in July 2007 through a consolidation of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(NASD) and the member regulation, enforcement and arbitration functions of the NYSE. FINRA is the
largest non-governmental regulator for all securities firms doing business in the United States.
FINRA is responsible for rule writing, firm examination, enforcement, arbitration and mediation
functions previously overseen by the NASD. Our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the
laws and regulations of the federal government and/or the various states as well as foreign
countries in which they conduct business.

Parent Bank Holding Company Activities

“Financial in Nature” Requirement.

As a bank holding company that has elected to become a
financial holding company pursuant to the BHC Act, we may affiliate with securities firms and
insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or
complementary to activities that are financial in nature. “Financial in nature” activities include
securities underwriting, dealing and market making, sponsoring mutual funds and investment



companies, insurance underwriting and agency, merchant banking, and activities that the FRB, in
consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, determines from time to time to be financial
in nature or incidental to such financial activity. “Complimentary activities” are activities that
the FRB determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a
safety and soundness risk.

FRB approval is not required for us to acquire a company (other than a bank holding company, bank
or savings association) engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to
activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior FRB approval is required
before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or
substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company, bank or savings association.
Because we are a financial holding company, if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under
the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), of less than satisfactory, we will be
prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better, from engaging in new activities
or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies, banks or savings associations, except
that we could engage in new activities, or acquire companies engaged in activities, that are
closely related to banking under the BHC Act. In addition, if the FRB finds that any of our
subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed, we would be required to enter into an
agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which
may contain additional limitations or conditions. Until corrected, we could be prohibited from
engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely
related to banking under the BHC Act without prior FRB approval. If we fail to correct any such
condition within a prescribed period, the FRB could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or,
in the alternative, to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking
under the BHC Act.

We became a financial holding company effective March 13, 2000. We continue to maintain our status
as a bank holding company for purposes of other FRB regulations.

Interstate Banking

. Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Act (Riegle-Neal Act),
a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state
requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to
exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company not control, prior to or
following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured
depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial
entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount
set by the state).

The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate
branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states where
authorized under the laws of those states.

Regulatory Approval.

In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank
regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition,
financial condition, and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and
levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws
and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the



acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the CRA, and the effectiveness of the acquiring
institution in combating money laundering activities.

Dividend Restrictions

The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other
subsidiaries. A significant source of funds to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and
principal and interest on its debt is dividends from its subsidiaries. Various federal and state
statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent’s subsidiary banks
and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. For information about the
restrictions applicable to the Parent’s subsidiary banks, see Note 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend
Restrictions) to Financial Statements included in the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders.
Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Parent’s subsidiary banks from
engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses. The payment of dividends,
depending on the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound
practice. The ability of the Parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently,
and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines.

Holding Company Structure

Transfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks.

The Parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions
under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries
to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called “covered
transactions.” In general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit,
investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of
value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an
exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to
10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with
affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus. Also, loans and
extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured in specified amounts. A
bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length
terms.

Source of Strength.

The FRB has a policy that a bank holding company is expected to act as a
source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate
circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be
required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support.

The OCC may order an assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its national bank
subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three
months, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the
deficiency.

Capital loans by the Parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to
deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, in the event of the
Parent’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to



maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to
a priority of payment.

Depositor Preference.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) provides that, in the event of
the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of
depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors)
and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over
other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails,
insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of
unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the Parent, with respect to any extensions of credit
they have made to such insured depository institution.

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions.

All of the Company’s subsidiary banks are insured
by the FDIC. FDIC-insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or
reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an FDIC-insured depository
institution controlled by the same bank holding company, and for any assistance provided by the
FDIC to an FDIC-insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled
by the same bank holding company. “Default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or
receiver. “In danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating
that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.

Capital Requirements

We are subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the FRB, which are
substantially similar to those imposed by the OCC and the FDIC on depository institutions within
their jurisdictions. Under these guidelines, a depository institution’s or a holding company’s
assets and certain specified off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various
risk categories. A depository institution’s or holding company’s capital, in turn, is classified
into one of three tiers. Tier 1 capital includes common equity, noncumulative perpetual preferred
stock, a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock at the holding company level, and
minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other
deductions. Tier 2 capital includes, among other things, perpetual preferred stock not qualified as
Tier 1 capital, subordinated debt, and allowances for loan and lease losses, subject to certain
limitations. Tier 3 capital includes qualifying unsecured subordinated debt. At least one-half of a
bank’s total capital must qualify as Tier 1 capital.

National banks and bank holding companies currently are required to maintain Tier 1 capital and the
sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital equal to at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of their total
risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of
credit). The federal bank regulatory agencies may, however, set higher capital requirements for an
individual bank or when a bank’s particular circumstances warrant. The FRB may also set higher
capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding
companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong
capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance
on intangible assets. Also, the FRB considers a “tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio” (deducting all
intangibles) and other indications of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or
engaging in new activities.



Effective April 1, 2002, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued new rules that establish minimum capital
requirements for equity investments in nonfinancial companies. These rules impose a capital charge
that increases incrementally as the level of nonfinancial equity investments increases relative to
Tier 1 capital. These capital charges range from Tier 1 capital charges of 8% to 25% of the
adjusted carrying value of the nonfinancial equity investments.

The FRB, OCC and FDIC rules also require us to incorporate market and interest rate risk components
into our regulatory capital computations. Under the market risk requirements, capital is allocated
to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution’s ongoing trading
activities.

In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision published new international guidelines for
determining regulatory capital that are designed to be more risk sensitive than the existing
framework and to promote enhanced risk management practices among large, internationally active
banking organizations. The United States federal bank regulatory agencies each approved a final
rule similar to the international guidelines in November 2007. This new advance capital adequacy
framework is known as “Basel II,” and is intended to more closely align regulatory capital
requirements with actual risks. Basel II incorporates three pillars that address (a) capital
adequacy, (b) supervisory review, which relates to the computation of capital and internal
assessment processes, and (c) market discipline, through increased disclosure requirements.
Embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk strategy, measurement and management that relate
to credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. Banking organizations are required to enhance
the measurement and management of those risks through the use of advanced approaches for
calculating risk-based capital requirements. Under the final rule, banks subject to the rule must
develop an implementation plan within six months of the rule’s effective date with the transitional
period for capital calculation to begin within 36 months of the effective date of the final rule.
Basel II includes safeguards that include a requirement that banking organizations conduct a
parallel run over a period of four consecutive calendar quarters for measuring regulatory capital
under the new regulatory capital rules and the existing general risk-based capital rules before
solely operating under the Basel II framework; a requirement that an institution satisfactorily
complete a series of transitional periods before operating under Basel II without floors; and a
commitment by the federal bank regulatory agencies to conduct ongoing analysis of the framework to
ensure Basel II is working as intended. The first possible year for a bank to begin its parallel
run is 2008. Following a successful parallel run period, a banking organization would have to
progress through three transitional periods (each lasting at least one year), during which there
would be floors on potential declines in risk-based capital requirements as calculated under the
current rules. Those transitional floors provide for maximum cumulative reductions of required
risk-based capital of 5% during the first year of implementation, 10% in the second year and 15% in
the third year. 2009 is the first possible year a bank may begin its first of the three
transitional floor periods. A banking organization will need approval from its primary Federal
regulator to move into each of the transitional floor periods, and at the end of the third
transitional floor period to move to full implementation. We continue to analyze the Basel II
capital standards and have established a project management infrastructure to address and meet the
new regulations.

In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies have established minimum leverage (Tier 1 capital
to adjusted average total assets) guidelines for banks within their regulatory jurisdiction. These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banks that meet certain



specified
criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and the
highest regulatory rating. Institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a
leverage ratio of 4%. Our Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio as of
December 31, 2008 are included in Note 26 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial
Statements included in the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders.

From time to time, the FRB and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)
propose changes and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital guidelines and
related reporting instructions. Such proposals or interpretations could, if implemented in the
future, affect our reported capital ratios and net risk-adjusted assets.

As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions,
the FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital safety and
soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The
standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure and
executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail
to meet such standards.

The FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with
respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. A
depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will
depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors,
as established by regulation.

Deposit Insurance Assessments

Our bank subsidiaries, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wachovia Bank, N.A., are members of the
Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits
of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The DIF was formed March 31, 2006, upon
the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Insurance Fund in accordance with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005. The Act established a range of 1.15% to 1.50% within which
the FDIC Board of Directors may set the Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR). The current target DRR is
1.25%. However, the Act has eliminated the restrictions on premium rates based on the DRR and
grants the FDIC Board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured
institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio.

To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on their deposits
and their institutional risk category. The FDIC determines an institution’s risk category by
combining its supervisory ratings with its financial ratios and other risk measures. For large
institutions (assets of $10 billion or more), the FDIC generally determines risk by combining
supervisory ratings with the institution’s long-term debt issuer ratings. Recent failures have
resulted in a decline in the reserve ratio to below 1.15%. Under the Act the FDIC is required to
establish and implement a restoration plan to restore the reserve ratio to 1.15% within five years
of the establishment of the plan. The FDIC adopted a final rule effective January 1, 2009, raising
current rates uniformly by 7 cents per $100 of domestic deposits for the first quarter of 2009
only. Rates for first quarter 2009 will range from a minimum of 12 cents per $100 of domestic
deposits for well-managed, well-capitalized banks with the highest credit ratings, to 50 cents for



institutions posing the most risk to the DIF. Proposed rates beginning April 1, 2009, range from a
minimum initial assessment rate of 10 cents per $100 of domestic deposits to a maximum of 45 cents
per $100 of domestic deposits. Risk-based adjustments to the initial assessment rate may lower or
raise a depository institution’s rate to 8 cents per $100 of domestic deposits for well-managed,
well-capitalized banks with the highest credit ratings to 77.5 cents for institutions posing the
most risk to the DIF. The final rule is expected early in 2009.

The FDIC may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the
institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in
unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition
enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for
one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings,
depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved.

All FDIC-insured depository institutions must also pay an annual assessment to interest payments on
bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a federal corporation chartered under the authority of
the Federal Housing Finance Board. The bonds (commonly referred to as FICO bonds) were issued to
capitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FDIC-insured depository institutions
paid approximately 1.10 to 1.14 cents per $100 of assessable deposits in 2008. The FDIC established
the FICO assessment rate effective for the first quarter of 2009 at approximately 1.14 cents
annually per $100 of assessable deposits.

Additionally, under the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, in 2009
participating depository institutions will pay a premium of 10 cents per $100 to fully insure
domestic noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. This additional assessment is paid on account
balances in excess of the insurance limits.

Federal Home Loan Bank Membership

We are a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, the
Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco
(collectively, the FHLBs). Each member of each of the FHLBs is required to maintain a minimum
investment in capital stock of the applicable FHLB. The Board of Directors of each FHLB can
increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital
is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the
minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal
Housing Finance Board. Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment in any of
the FHLBs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, potential future payments to the
FHLBs are not determinable.

Fiscal and Monetary Policies

Our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the
federal government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which
regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Among the instruments of monetary
policy available to the FRB are (a) conducting open market operations in United States government
securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing
or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits, and (d) imposing or



changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These
methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank
loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The
policies of the FRB may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Privacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Restrictions on Cross-Selling

Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act), have
adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic
information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy
policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure
of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of the GLB
Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies
and conveyed to outside vendors.

Federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the Fair and Accurate Credit
Transactions Act (the FACT Act) which have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting
period, after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers, before information can be shared
among different Wells Fargo companies for the purpose of cross-selling Wells Fargo’s products and
services. This may result in certain cross-sell programs being less effective than they have been
in the past. Wells Fargo has complied with these regulations.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented a broad range of corporate governance
and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for
accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by
improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws. We are subject
to Sarbanes-Oxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and/or its implementing
regulations have established new membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our
audit committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors
(including restrictions on the types of non-audit services our auditors may provide to us), imposed
additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders,
required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control
over financial reporting, and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over
financial reporting. The NYSE has imposed a number of new corporate governance requirements as
well.

Patriot Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law
enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety
of fronts. The Patriot Act has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers,
dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act requires us to
implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to
anti-money laundering,



compliance, suspicious activities, and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. The
Patriot Act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in
combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition.

U.S. Treasury’s TARP Capital Purchase Program

On October 28, 2008, Wells Fargo issued preferred stock and a warrant to purchase its common stock
to the U.S. Treasury as a participant in the TARP Capital Purchase Program. Prior to
October 28, 2011, unless we have redeemed all of this preferred stock or the U.S. Treasury has
transferred all of this preferred stock to a third party, the consent of the U.S. Treasury will be
required for us to, among other things, increase our common stock dividend above the current quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per share or repurchase our common stock or outstanding preferred
stock except in limited circumstances. Further, as long as the preferred stock issued to the U.S.
Treasury is outstanding, dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to our common
stock are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on that preferred stock,
subject to certain exceptions. In addition, until the U.S. Treasury ceases to own any of our
securities sold under the TARP Capital Purchase Program, the compensation arrangements for our
senior executive officers must comply with the U.S. Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) and the rules and regulations thereunder.


EESA requires the following provisions with respect to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and our next three most highly compensated officers (senior executive officers): limits on compensation to exclude incentives to take unnecessary and excessive risks; a clawback with respect to incentive compensation based on statements of earnings, gains or other criteria that
are later proven to be materially inaccurate; and a prohibition on golden parachute payments. EESA
also limits the deductibility of compensation earned by our senior executive officers to $500,000 per year.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (Stimulus Act), which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, imposes extensive new restrictions on
participants in the TARP Capital Purchase Program. The new restrictions include additional limits on executive
compensation such as prohibiting the payment or accrual of any bonus, retention award or incentive
compensation to our senior executive officers and the next 20 most highly compensated employees except
for the payment of long-term restricted stock; prohibiting any compensation plan that would encourage
the manipulation of earnings; and extending the clawback required by EESA to the top 20 most highly
compensated employees. The Stimulus Act also requires compliance with new corporate governance
standards including an annual “say on pay” shareholder vote, the adoption of policies regarding
excessive or luxury expenditures, and a certification by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer that we have complied with the standards in the Stimulus Act. The full impact
of the Stimulus Act is not yet certain because it calls for additional regulatory action. The
Company will continue to monitor the effect of the Stimulus Act and the anticipated regulations.

FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program

Wells Fargo and certain of its subsidiary national banks, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and
Wachovia Bank, N.A., are participating in the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
(TLGP), which applies to U.S. depository institutions insured by the FDIC and U.S. bank



holding companies, unless they have opted out of the TLGP or the FDIC has terminated their participation.
Under the TLGP, the FDIC guarantees certain of our senior unsecured debt, as well as certain
noninterest-bearing deposits at our banks. Under the debt-guarantee component of the TLGP, the FDIC
will pay the unpaid principal and interest on an FDIC-guaranteed debt instrument upon the failure
of the participating entity to make a timely payment of principal or interest in accordance with
the terms of the instrument. Under the deposit account guarantee component of the TLGP, all
noninterest-bearing transaction accounts maintained at our banks are insured in full by the FDIC
until December 31, 2009, regardless of the existing deposit insurance limit of $250,000. In return
for these guarantees, we will pay the FDIC a 10 basis point fee on any deposit amounts exceeding
the existing deposit insurance limit and a fee that fluctuates based on the amount and maturity of
the guaranteed debt.

Future Legislation

In light of current conditions in the U.S. and global financial markets and the U.S. and global
economy, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services
industry. Proposals that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services
industry are expected to be introduced in the U.S. Congress, in state legislatures and from
applicable regulatory authorities. These proposals may change banking statutes and regulation and
our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, these proposals could
increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect
the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial
institutions. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the
effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our business, results of operations
or financial condition.
