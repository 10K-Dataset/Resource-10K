DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

General

Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services company organized under the laws of Delaware and registered as a bank holding company and
financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act). Based on assets at December 31, 2002, it was the fourth largest bank holding company in the United
States. In this report, Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated) is referred to as the Company and Wells Fargo & Company alone is referred to as the Parent.

The
Company engages in banking and a variety of related financial services businesses. Retail, commercial and corporate banking services are provided through bank subsidiaries located in
Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington,
Wisconsin and Wyoming. Other financial services are provided by subsidiaries engaged in various businesses, principally: wholesale banking, mortgage banking, consumer finance, equipment leasing,
agricultural finance, commercial finance, securities brokerage and investment banking, insurance agency services, computer and data processing services, trust services, mortgage-backed securities
servicing and venture capital investment.

On
October 25, 2000, the Company completed its merger with First Security Corporation (the FSCO Merger), with First Security Corporation surviving the merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Parent. The Company accounted for the FSCO Merger under the pooling-of-interests method of accounting. Accordingly, the information included in this report,
including the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, presents the combined results as if the merger had
been in effect for all periods presented.

The
Company has three operating segments for management reporting purposes: Community Banking, Wholesale Banking and Wells Fargo Financial. The 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders
includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments.

The
Company had 127,500 full-time equivalent team members at December 31, 2002.

History and Growth

The Company is the product of the merger of equals involving Norwest Corporation and the former Wells Fargo & Company, completed on November 2, 1998
(the WFC Merger). On completion of the WFC Merger, Norwest Corporation changed its name to Wells Fargo & Company.

Norwest
Corporation, prior to the WFC Merger, provided banking services to customers in 16 states and additional financial services through subsidiaries engaged in a variety of
businesses including mortgage banking and consumer finance.

The
former Wells Fargo & Company's principal subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., was the successor to the banking portion of the business founded by Henry Wells and William G.
Fargo in 1852. That business later operated the westernmost leg of the Pony Express and ran stagecoach lines in the western part of the United States. The California banking business was separated
from the express business in 1905, was merged in 1960 with American Trust Company, another of the


oldest banks in the Western United States, and became Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association, in 1968.

The
former Wells Fargo & Company acquired First Interstate Bancorp in April 1996. First Interstate's assets had an approximate book value of $55 billion. The
transaction was valued at approximately $11.3 billion and was accounted for as a purchase.

The
Company expands its business, in part, by acquiring banking institutions and other companies engaged in activities that are financial in nature. The Company continues to explore
opportunities to acquire banking institutions and other financial services companies. Discussions are continually being carried on related to such possible acquisitions. The Company cannot predict
whether, or on what terms, such discussions will result in further acquisitions. As a matter of policy, the Company generally does not comment on such discussions or possible acquisitions until a
definitive acquisition agreement has been signed.

Competition

The financial services industry is highly competitive. The Company's subsidiaries compete with financial services providers, such as banks, savings and loan
associations, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, and money market and mutual fund companies. They also face increased competition from nonbank
institutions such as brokerage houses and insurance companies, as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies. Many of these competitors enjoy fewer
regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures.

Securities
firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. Acquisitions of this type could
significantly change the competitive environment in which the Company conducts business. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances
enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds
between parties.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

The following discussion, together with Notes 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions) and 25 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements
included in the 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders sets forth the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain
information specific to the Company. This regulatory framework is intended to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, and not to protect security
holders. To the extent that the information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to those provisions. Further, such statutes, regulations and
policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company,
including changes in interpretation or implementation thereof, could have a material effect on the Company's business.

Applicable
laws and regulations could restrict the Company's ability to diversify into other areas of financial services, acquire depository institutions, and pay dividends on the
Company's capital


stock. They could also require the Company to provide financial support to one or more of its subsidiary banks, maintain capital balances in excess of those desired by management, and pay higher
deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions.

General

Parent Bank Holding Company.

As a bank holding company, the Parent is subject to regulation under the BHC Act and to
inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB).

Subsidiary Banks.

The Company's national subsidiary banks are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and secondarily by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FRB. The Company's state-chartered banks are subject to primary federal regulation
and examination by the FDIC and, in addition, are regulated and examined by their respective state banking departments.

Nonbank Subsidiaries.

Many of the Company's nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FRB and other
applicable federal and state agencies. The Company's brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
and state securities regulators. The Company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies. Other nonbank subsidiaries of the Company may be
subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government and/or the various states in which they conduct business.


Parent Bank Holding Company Activities

"Financial in Nature" Requirement.

As a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant
to the BHC Act, the Company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that
are financial in nature. "Financial in nature" activities include securities underwriting, dealing and market making, sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and
agency, merchant banking, and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, determines from time to time to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial
activity or is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a safety and soundness risk. A bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in
banking and such other activities as determined by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

Federal
Reserve Board approval is not required for the Company to acquire a company (other than a bank holding company, bank or savings association) engaged in activities that are
financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior FRB approval is required before the Company may acquire the beneficial ownership or
control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company, bank or savings association.

Because
the Company is a financial holding company, if any subsidiary bank of the Company ceases to be "well capitalized" or "well managed" under applicable regulatory standards, the FRB
may, among other actions, order the Company to divest the subsidiary bank. Alternatively, the Company may elect to restrict the Company's activities to those permissible for a bank holding company
that is not also a financial holding company.

Also
because the Company is a financial holding company, if any subsidiary bank of the Company receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 of less than satisfactory,
the Company will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better, from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies, banks or savings
associations, except that the Company could engage in new activities, or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the BHC Act.

The
Company became a financial holding company effective March 13, 2000. It continues to maintain its status as a bank holding company for purposes of other FRB regulations.

Interstate Banking.

Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Act (Riegle-Neal Act), a
bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed
five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company not control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository
institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company's initial entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the
state).

The
Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish

de novo

branches in other states where
authorized under the laws of those states.


Regulatory Approval.

In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider,
among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition, the projected capital ratios and levels on a
post-acquisition basis, and the acquiring institution's record of addressing the credit needs of the communities it serves, including the needs of low and moderate income neighborhoods,
consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank, under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended.

Dividend Restrictions

The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries. Its principal source of funds to pay dividends on its common
and preferred stock and principal and interest on its debt is dividends from its subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent's
subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. For information about the restrictions applicable to the Parent's subsidiary banks, see Note 3 (Cash, Loan
and Dividend Restrictions) to Financial Statements included in the 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders.

Federal
bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Parent's subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses. The payment of
dividends,
depending on the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. The ability of the Parent's subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently,
and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines.

Holding Company Structure

Transfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks.

The Parent's subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that
limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called "covered transactions." In
general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, as well as other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an
affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and
surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus. Also, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates
generally are required to be secured in specified amounts. A bank's transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm's length terms.

Source of Strength.

The FRB has a policy that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and
managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when the bank
holding company may not have the resources to provide the support.

The
OCC may order the assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three
months, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent's stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency.


Capital
loans by the Parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, in the
event of the Parent's bankruptcy, any commitment by the Parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled
to a priority of payment.

Depositor Preference.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) provides that, in the event of the "liquidation or other
resolution" of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the
institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general
unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured,
nondeposit creditors, including the Parent, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions.

All of the Parent's banks are insured by the FDIC. FDIC-insured
depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an FDIC-insured depository institution controlled
by the same bank holding company, and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an FDIC-insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank
holding company. "Default" means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. "In danger of default" means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely
to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.

Capital Requirements

The Parent is subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the FRB, which are substantially similar to the capital requirements and
guidelines imposed by the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC on depository institutions within their jurisdictions. For information about these capital requirements and guidelines, see Note 25
(Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements included in the 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders.

The
FRB may set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are
expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. Also, the FRB considers a "tangible Tier 1 leverage
ratio" (deducting all intangibles) and other indications of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or engaging in new activities.

Effective
April 1, 2002, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued new rules governing the capital treatment of nonfinancial equity investments, which includes investments made by the
Company's venture capital subsidiaries. The rules impose a capital charge that increases incrementally as the level of nonfinancial equity investments increases relative to Tier 1 capital. For covered
investments that total less than 15% of Tier 1 capital, the rules require a Tier 1 capital charge of 8% of the adjusted carrying value of the covered investments. For covered investments that total
15% or more but less than 25%, the Tier 1 capital charge is 12%, and for covered investments that total 25% or more, the Tier 1 capital charge is 25%. The new rules have not had a material impact on
the Company.

FRB,
FDIC and OCC rules also require the Company to incorporate market and interest rate risk components into its regulatory capital computations. Under the market risk requirements,
capital is


allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution's ongoing trading activities.

The
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision continues to evaluate certain aspects of the proposed New Basel Capital Accord, with the goal of finalizing the Accord by the fourth quarter of
2003 with anticipated implementation by 2006. The New Basel Capital Accord incorporates three pillars that address (a) minimum capital requirements, (b) supervisory review, which relates
to an institution's capital adequacy and internal assessment process, and (c) market discipline, through effective disclosure to encourage safe and sound banking practices. Embodied within
these pillars are aspects of risk assessment that relate to credit risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, among others, and certain proposed approaches by the Basel Committee to complete such
assessments may be considered complex. The Company continues to monitor the status of the New Basel Accord.

From
time to time, the FRB and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) propose changes and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based
capital guidelines and related reporting instructions. Such proposals or interpretations could, if implemented in the future, affect the Company's reported capital ratios and net
risk-adjusted assets.

As
an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain
non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality,
interest rate exposure and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.

The
FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital
requirements. A depository institution's treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other
factors, as established by regulation.

Deposit Insurance Assessments

Through the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF), the FDIC insures the deposits of the Parent's depository institution
subsidiaries up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by BIF and SAIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory
capital ratios and other factors. Specifically, the assessment rate is based on the institution's capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category. An institution's capitalization risk
category is based on the FDIC's determination of whether
the institution is well capitalized, adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized. An institution's supervisory subgroup category is based on the FDIC's assessment of the financial
condition of the institution and the probability that FDIC intervention or other corrective action will be required.

The
BIF and SAIF assessment rate currently ranges from zero to 27 cents per $100 of domestic deposits. The BIF assessment rate for the Parent's depository institutions currently is zero.
The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi-annual basis. An increase in the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on the Parent's earnings,
depending on the amount of the increase. The FDIC is authorized to terminate a depository institution's deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the institution's financial condition is
unsafe or unsound


or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution's regulatory agency. The
termination of deposit insurance for one or more of the Parent's subsidiary depository institutions could have a material adverse effect on the Parent's earnings, depending on the collective size of
the particular institutions involved.

All
FDIC-insured depository institutions must pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a federal
corporation chartered under the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Board. The bonds (commonly referred to as FICO bonds) were issued to capitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation. FDIC-insured depository institutions paid approximately 1.8 cents per $100 of BIF-assessable deposits in 2002. The FDIC established the FICO assessment rate
effective for the first quarter of 2003 at approximately 1.7 cents annually per $100 of assessable deposits.

Fiscal and Monetary Policies

The Company's business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. The Company is
particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB are
(a) conducting open market operations in United States government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing
reserve requirements against depository institutions' deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These methods are
used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The policies of the FRB
may have a material effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.

Privacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act

Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act), have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial
institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers
to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial
services companies and conveyed to outside vendors.

Future Legislation

Various legislation, including proposals to change substantially the financial institution regulatory system, is from time to time introduced in Congress. This
legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, this legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing
business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict
whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the Company's business, results of operations or financial
condition.


ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME

The following table allocates the changes in net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis to changes in either average balances or average rates for both
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during any period, it is not possible to precisely allocate such changes between
volume and rate. For this table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated to these categories in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total nonaccrual loans was 259% and 229% at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This ratio may
fluctuate significantly from period to period due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, borrower credit strength and the value and marketability of collateral. Classification of a
loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal of a loan is uncollectible in whole or in part. Consequently, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans,
without taking into account numerous additional factors, is not a reliable indicator of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Indicators of the credit quality of the Company's loan portfolio
and the method of determining the allowance for loan losses are discussed below and in greater detail in the 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders.

This
amount and any unabsorbed portion of the allocated allowance are also available for any of the above listed loan categories.


See Note 5 (Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses) to Financial Statements included in the 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders for a description of the process used by the Company to
determine the adequacy and the components (allocated and unallocated) of the allowance for loan losses.

At
December 31, 2002, the allowance for loan losses was $3,862 million, or 1.96% of total loans, compared with $3,761 million, or 2.18%, at December 31, 2001.
During 2002, the net provision for loan losses approximated charge-offs. The components of the allowance, allocated and unallocated, are shown in the table on the previous page. The
allocated component decreased to $2,578 million at December 31, 2002 from $2,632 million at December 31, 2001, while the unallocated increased to $1,284 million at
December 31, 2002 from $1,129 million at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002, the unallocated portion of the allowance amounted to 33% of the total allowance, compared
with 30% at December 31, 2001.

The
$54 million decrease in the allocated component of the allowance from 2001 to 2002 was attributable to lower estimated loss rates in the retail lines of business, partially
offset by loan portfolio growth and changes in the loan grades and loan factors in the commercial and wholesale lines of business. Changes in allocated loan loss allowances arrived at through this
process reflect management's judgment concerning the effect of trends in borrower performance and recent economic activity on portfolio performance. Without these changes in loss factors and loss
rates, the allocated allowance would have increased by approximately $170 million due to loan growth of $24 billion during the year.

The
unallocated component of the allowance increased $155 million from 2001 to 2002, primarily due to overall portfolio loan growth, economic uncertainties, and certain industry
trends, including continued weakness in several sectors of agricultural lending, a deterioration in used car prices in automobile lending and increased vacancy rates in certain commercial office
lending markets. While the allocated component and the total allowance as a percentage of total loans both declined from 2001 to 2002, the unallocated component remained flat, reflecting the uncertain
economic environment and its impact on the Company's processes for estimating credit risk. The reduction in the unallocated portion of the allowance in 2001 compared with 2000 reflects the Company's
on-going effort to integrate its credit risk management processes following the mergers with the former Wells Fargo & Company in 1998 and First Security Corporation in 2000. Prior
to the migration to common processes, the Company maintained a portion of the unallocated allowance to mitigate the imprecision and uncertainty inherent in the Company's diverse processes for
estimating credit losses. The integration of credit risk management processes during 2001 increased the reliability of the Company's loss forecasting process and permitted the Company to reduce its
unallocated allowance.

Loan
balances and the allocated portion of the allowance both increased by 21% between 1999 and 2000. The unallocated portion of the allowance remained essentially flat, continuing to
provide coverage for the uncertainties in the Company's integration process. The Company continued the integration of its credit risk management processes during 2001 and reduced the unallocated
portion of the allowance. The allocated portion of the allowance continued to increase in 2001 as loan balances increased and credit performance showed indications of deterioration.

No
material changes in estimation methodology for the allowance were made in 2002.


The
Company considers the allowance for loan losses of $3,862 million adequate to cover losses inherent in loans, loan commitments, and standby and other letters of credit at
December 31, 2002.

The
foregoing discussion contains forward-looking statements about the adequacy of the Company's allowance for loan losses. These forward-looking statements are inherently subject to
risks and uncertainties. A number of factors—many of which are beyond the Company's control—could cause actual losses to be more than estimated losses. For a discussion of some
of the other factors that could cause actual losses to be more than estimated losses, see "Factors That May Affect Future Results" in the "Financial Review" section of the 2002 Annual Report to
Stockholders.
