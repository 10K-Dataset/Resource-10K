DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

General

Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services company organized under the laws of
Delaware and registered as a bank holding company and financial holding company under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act). Based on assets of $428 billion at December 31,
2004, it was the fifth largest bank holding company in the United States. In this report, Wells
Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated) is referred to as the Company and Wells Fargo &
Company alone is referred to as the Parent.

The Company engages in banking and a variety of related financial services businesses. Retail,
commercial and corporate banking services are provided through banking stores in Alaska, Arizona,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska,
Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin
and Wyoming. Other financial services are provided by subsidiaries engaged in various businesses,
principally: wholesale banking, mortgage banking, consumer finance, equipment leasing, agricultural
finance, commercial finance, securities brokerage and investment banking, insurance agency and
brokerage services, computer and data processing services, trust services, mortgage-backed
securities servicing and venture capital investment.

In February 2004, the Company completed the consolidation of 19 of its national bank charters into
a single, national bank charter, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo Bank). At
December 31, 2004, Wells Fargo Bank was the Parent’s principal subsidiary with $366 billion in
total assets, or 86% of the Company’s assets. Wells Fargo Bank is rated “Aaa” by Moody’s Investors
Service and is the only U.S. bank to have the highest possible credit rating assigned by Moody’s.

With the acquisition of certain assets of Strong Financial Corporation at the end of 2004, the
Company became one of the top 20 U.S. mutual fund companies, managing $100 billion in mutual funds.
Total assets managed or administered (including brokerage) by the Company were $791 billion at December 31, 2004.

The Company has three operating segments for management reporting purposes: Community Banking,
Wholesale Banking and Wells Fargo Financial. The 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders includes
financial information and descriptions of these operating segments.

The Company had 145,500 full-time equivalent team members at December 31, 2004.

History and Growth

The Company is the product of the merger involving Norwest Corporation and the former Wells Fargo &
Company, completed on November 2, 1998 (the WFC Merger). On completion of the WFC Merger, Norwest
Corporation changed its name to Wells Fargo & Company.



Norwest Corporation was organized in 1929 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Prior to the WFC
Merger, it provided banking services to customers in 16 states and additional financial services
through subsidiaries engaged in a variety of businesses including mortgage banking and consumer
finance.

The former Wells Fargo & Company’s principal subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., was the successor
to the banking portion of the business founded by Henry Wells and William G. Fargo in 1852. That
business later operated the westernmost leg of the Pony Express and ran stagecoach lines in the
western part of the United States. The California banking business was separated from the express
business in 1905, merged in 1960 with American Trust Company, another of the oldest banks in the
Western United States, and became Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association, in 1968.

In April 1996, the former Wells Fargo & Company acquired First Interstate Bancorp, a $55 billion
bank holding company in a transaction valued at $11 billion. In October 2000, the Company acquired
First Security Corporation, a $23 billion bank holding company in a transaction valued at $3
billion.

The Company expands its business, in part, by acquiring banking institutions and other companies
engaged in activities that are financial in nature. The Company continues to explore opportunities
to acquire banking institutions and other financial services companies, and discussions are
continually being carried on related to such possible acquisitions. The Company cannot predict
whether, or on what terms, such discussions will result in further acquisitions. As a matter of
policy, the Company generally does not comment on such discussions or possible acquisitions until a
definitive acquisition agreement has been signed.

Competition

The financial services industry is highly competitive. The Company’s subsidiaries compete with
financial services providers, such as banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance
companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, and money market and mutual fund
companies. They also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses
and insurance companies, as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and
manufacturing companies. Many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may
have lower cost structures.

Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may
acquire banks and other financial institutions. Combinations of this type could significantly
change the competitive environment in which the Company conducts business. The financial services
industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more
companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance
of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between
parties.



REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

The following discussion, together with Notes 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions) and 26
(Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements included in the 2004 Annual
Report to Stockholders, sets forth the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to
bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain information specific to us. This
regulatory framework is intended to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the
banking system as a whole, and not to protect security holders. To the extent that the information
describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to
those provisions. Further, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by
Congress and state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes,
regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us, including changes in interpretation or
implementation thereof, could have a material effect on the Company’s business.

Laws and regulations could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial
services, acquire depository institutions, and pay dividends on our capital stock. The Company may
also be required to provide financial support to one or more of its subsidiary banks, maintain
capital balances in excess of those desired by management, and pay higher deposit insurance
premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository
institutions.

General

Parent Bank Holding Company.

As a bank holding company, the Parent is subject to regulation under
the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB).

Subsidiary Banks.

The Company’s subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and
examination primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and secondarily by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FRB. The Company’s state-chartered banks are
subject to primary federal regulation and examination by the FDIC and, in addition, are regulated
and examined by their respective state banking departments.

Nonbank Subsidiaries.

Many of the Company’s nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by
the FRB and other applicable federal and state agencies. The Company’s brokerage subsidiaries are
regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. and state securities regulators. The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to
regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies. The Company’s other nonbank
subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government and/or the
various states in which they conduct business.

Parent Bank Holding Company Activities

“Financial in Nature” Requirement.

As a bank holding company that has elected to become a
financial holding company pursuant to the BHC Act, the Company may affiliate with securities firms
and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or



incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. “Financial in nature”
activities include securities underwriting, dealing and market making, sponsoring mutual funds and
investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency, merchant banking, and activities that the
FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, determines from time to time to be
financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or is complementary to a financial
activity and does not pose a safety and soundness risk.

FRB approval is not required for the Company to acquire a company (other than a bank holding
company, bank or savings association) engaged in activities that are financial in nature or
incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior FRB approval
is required before the Company may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of
the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company, bank or savings
association.

Because the Company is a financial holding company, if any of our subsidiary banks receives a
rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), of less than satisfactory,
the Company will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better, from engaging
in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies, banks or savings
associations, except that the Company could engage in new activities, or acquire companies engaged
in activities that are closely related to banking under the BHC Act. In addition, if the FRB finds
that any of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed, the Company would be
required to enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and
management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions. Until
corrected, the Company would not be able to engage in any new activity or acquire companies engaged
in activities that are not closely related to banking under the BHC Act without prior FRB approval.
If the Company fails to correct any such condition within a prescribed period, the FRB could order
the Company to divest of its banking subsidiaries or, in the alternative, to cease engaging in
activities other than those closely related to banking under the BHC Act.

The Company became a financial holding company effective March 13, 2000. It continues to maintain
its status as a bank holding company for purposes of other FRB regulations.

Interstate Banking

. Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Act (Riegle-Neal Act),
a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state
requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to
exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company not control, prior to or
following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured
depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial
entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount
set by the state).

The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate
branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states where
authorized under the laws of those states.



Regulatory Approval.

In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank
regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition,
financial condition, and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and
levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws
and regulation, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring
institution’s record of compliance under the CRA, and the effectiveness of the acquiring
institution in combating money laundering activities.

Dividend Restrictions

The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other
subsidiaries. Its principal source of funds to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and
principal and interest on its debt is dividends from its subsidiaries. Various federal and state
statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent’s subsidiary banks
and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. For information about the
restrictions applicable to the Parent’s subsidiary banks, see Note 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend
Restrictions) to Financial Statements included in the 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders.

Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Parent’s subsidiary banks from
engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses. The payment of dividends,
depending on the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound
practice. The ability of the Parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently,
and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines.

Holding Company Structure

Transfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks.

The Parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions
under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries
to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called “covered
transactions.” In general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit,
investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of
value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an
exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to
10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with
affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus. Also, loans and
extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured in specified amounts. A
bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length
terms.

Source of Strength.

The FRB has a policy that a bank holding company is expected to act as a
source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate
circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be
required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support.



The OCC may order the assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its national bank
subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three
months, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the
deficiency.

Capital loans by the Parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to
deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, in the event of the
Parent’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain
the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a
priority of payment.

Depositor Preference.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) provides that, in the event of
the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of
depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors)
and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over
other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails,
insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of
unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the Parent, with respect to any extensions of credit
they have made to such insured depository institution.

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions.

All of the Parent’s banks are insured by the FDIC.
FDIC-insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably
expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an FDIC-insured depository institution
controlled by the same bank holding company, and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an
FDIC-insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same
bank holding company. “Default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. “In
danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is
likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.

Capital Requirements

The Parent is subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the FRB, which
are substantially similar to the capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the FRB, the OCC
and the FDIC on depository institutions within their jurisdictions. For information about these
capital requirements and guidelines, see Note 26 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to
Financial Statements included in the 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders.

The FRB may set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it.
For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to
maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without
significant reliance on intangible assets. Also, the FRB considers a “tangible Tier 1 leverage
ratio” (deducting all intangibles) and other indications of capital strength in evaluating
proposals for expansion or engaging in new activities.



FRB, FDIC and OCC rules also require the Company to incorporate market and interest rate risk
components into its regulatory capital computations. Under the market risk requirements, capital is
allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution’s ongoing trading
activities.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision continues to evaluate certain aspects of the proposed
New Basel Capital Accord. The New Basel Capital Accord incorporates three pillars that address (a)
minimum capital requirements, (b) supervisory review, which relates to an institution’s capital
adequacy and internal assessment process, and (c) market discipline, through effective disclosure
to encourage safe and sound banking practices. Embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk
assessment that relate to credit risk, interest rate risk, and operational risk, among others, and
certain proposed approaches by the Basel Committee to complete such assessments may be considered
complex. The Company continues to monitor the status of the New Basel Capital Accord and expects
final rules to be published in mid-2006, effective 2008.

From time to time, the FRB and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)
propose changes and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital guidelines and
related reporting instructions. Such proposals or interpretations could, if implemented in the
future, affect the Company’s reported capital ratios and net risk-adjusted assets.

As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions,
the FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital safety and
soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The
standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure and
executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail
to meet such standards.

The FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with
respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. A
depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will
depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors,
as established by regulation.

Deposit Insurance Assessments

Through the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF), the FDIC
insures the deposits of the Parent’s depository institution subsidiaries up to prescribed limits
for each depositor. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by a BIF and SAIF member institution is
based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors.
Specifically, the assessment rate is based on the institution’s capitalization risk category and
supervisory subgroup category. An institution’s capitalization risk category is based on the FDIC’s
determination of whether the institution is well capitalized, adequately capitalized or less than
adequately capitalized. An institution’s supervisory subgroup category is based on the FDIC’s
assessment of the financial condition of the institution and the probability that FDIC intervention
or other corrective action will be required.



The BIF and SAIF assessment rate currently ranges from zero to 27 cents per $100 of domestic
deposits. The BIF and SAIF assessment rate for the Company’s depository institutions currently is
zero. The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi-annual basis. An
increase in the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s earnings,
depending on the amount of the increase. The FDIC is authorized to terminate a depository
institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the institution’s financial
condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices
or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the
institution’s regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for one or more of the
Company’s subsidiary depository institutions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
earnings, depending on the collective size of the particular institutions involved.

All FDIC-insured depository institutions must pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the
payment of interest on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a federal corporation chartered
under the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Board. The bonds (commonly referred to as FICO
bonds) were issued to capitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FDIC-insured
depository institutions paid approximately 1.5 cents per $100 of BIF-assessable deposits in 2004.
The FDIC established the FICO assessment rate effective for the first quarter of 2005 at
approximately 1.4 cents annually per $100 of assessable deposits.

Fiscal and Monetary Policies

The Company’s business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies
of the federal government and its agencies. The Company is particularly affected by the policies of
the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Among the instruments
of monetary policy available to the FRB are (a) conducting open market operations in United States
government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions,
(c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits, and (d)
imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates.
These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of
bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The
policies of the FRB may have a material effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Privacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act

Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act), have
adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic
information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy
policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain
personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect
how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and
conveyed to outside vendors.



Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented a broad range of corporate governance
and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for
accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by
improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws. The Company is
subject to Sarbanes-Oxley because it is required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and/or its implementing
regulations have established new membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our
audit committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between the Company and its outside
auditors (including restrictions on the types of non-audit services our auditors may provide to
us), imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, expanded the disclosure requirements for our
corporate insiders, and required our management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and required our auditors to issue a
report on our internal control over financial reporting. The New York Stock Exchange has imposed a
number of new corporate governance requirements as well.

Patriot Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law
enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety
of fronts. The Patriot Act has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers,
dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act requires the
Company to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to anti-money laundering,
compliance, suspicious activities, and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on
customers. The Patriot Act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of
an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank
acquisition.

Future Legislation

Various legislation, including proposals to change substantially the financial institution
regulatory system, is from time to time introduced in Congress. This legislation may change banking
statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If
enacted, this legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand
permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit
unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any of this potential
legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations,
would have on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME

The following table allocates the changes in net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis to
changes in either average balances or average rates for both interest-earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during
any period, it is not possible to precisely allocate such changes between volume and rate. For this
table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated to these categories
in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Indicators of the credit quality of our loan portfolio and the method of determining the allowance
for credit losses, which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded
credit commitments, are discussed below and in greater detail in the 2004 Annual Report to
Stockholders. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to net charge-offs was 237% and 226% at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This ratio fluctuates from period to period and the
change in 2004 is indicative of stable loss rates within the various consumer and small business
lines and unsustainable low loss rates within the wholesale middle market and real estate
portfolios. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans was 291% and
267% at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This ratio may fluctuate significantly from
period to period due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, borrower credit
strength and the value and marketability of collateral.

See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements included in the
2004 Annual Report to Stockholders for a description of the process used by the Company to
determine the adequacy and the components (allocated and unallocated) of the allowance for credit
losses.

The allowance for credit losses was $3,950 million at December 31, 2004, and $3,891 million at
December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the allowance for loan losses was $3,762 million, or
1.31% of total loans, compared with $3,891 million, or 1.54%, at December 31, 2003. During 2004,
the provision for credit losses was $1,717 million and net loan charge-offs totaled $1,666 million.
The components of the allowance for credit losses, allocated and unallocated, are shown in the
table on the previous page. The allocated component was $3,062 million at December 31, 2004 and
$3,072 million at December 31, 2003, while the unallocated was $888 million at December 31, 2004,
and $819 million at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the unallocated portion of the
allowance for credit losses was 22% of the total allowance, compared with 21% at December 31, 2003.

The allocated component of the allowance for credit losses decreased $10 million from 2003 to 2004.
Changes in allocated allowance reflect changes in statistically derived loss estimates, historical
loss experience, and current trends in borrower risk and/or general economic activity on portfolio
performance.

The unallocated component of the allowance for credit losses increased $69 million from 2003 to
2004, and reflects our judgment of risks and uncertainties inherent in the portfolio and other
subjective factors.

No material changes in estimation methodology for the allowance for credit losses were made in
2004.

The Company considers the allowance for credit losses of $3,950 million, which includes the $188
million reserve for unfunded credit commitments, adequate to cover credit losses inherent in the
loan portfolio at December 31, 2004.

The foregoing discussion contains forward-looking statements about the adequacy of the Company’s
allowance for credit losses. These forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties. A number of factors—many beyond our control—could cause actual losses to be more
than estimated losses. For a discussion of some of the other factors that could cause actual losses
to be more than estimated losses, see “Factors That May Affect Future Results” in the “Financial
Review” section of the 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders.
