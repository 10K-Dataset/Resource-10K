DESCRIPTION OF BusinesS

General

We are a diversified financial services company.
We provide retail, commercial and corporate banking services through banking
stores and offices, the internet and other distribution channels to
individuals, businesses and institutions in all 50 states, the District of
Columbia

and in other countries.

We provide other financial services through
subsidiaries engaged in various businesses, principally: wholesale banking,
mortgage banking, consumer finance, equipment leasing, agricultural finance,
commercial finance, securities brokerage and investment banking, insurance
agency and brokerage services, computer and data processing services, trust
services, investment advisory services, mortgage-backed securities servicing
and venture capital investment.

We have three operating
segments for management reporting purposes: Community Banking; Wholesale
Banking; and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement. The 2013 Annual Report to
Stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating
segments.

Competition

The financial services industry is highly competitive. Our subsidiaries
compete with financial services providers such as banks, savings and loan
associations, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage banking companies,
insurance companies, investment banks and mutual fund companies. They also face
increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses, as
well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing
companies. Many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and
some may have lower cost structures.

Securities firms and insurance companies
that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other
financial institutions. Combinations of this type could significantly change
the competitive environment in which we conduct business. The financial
services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further
technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services.
These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions
and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.


REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

We describe below, and in Notes 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions)
and 26 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements
included in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders, the material elements of
the regulatory framework applicable to us. Banking statutes, regulations and
policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and
federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as foreign governments and
financial regulators, and a change in them, including changes in how they are
interpreted or implemented, could have a material effect on our business. The
regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to
protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers and the banking
system as a whole, and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such
as the Company.

Statutes, regulations and policies could
restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services,
acquire depository institutions, and pay dividends on our capital stock. They
may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our
subsidiary banks, maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by
management, and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general
deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions. See the
“Risk Factors” section in the 2013

Annual Report to Stockholders for additional information.

General

Parent Bank Holding Company.

As a bank holding company, the Parent is
subject to regulation under the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and
supervision by its primary regulator, the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB). The Parent is also subject to
the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as
administered by the SEC. As a company with securities listed on the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Parent is subject to the rules of the NYSE for
listed companies.

Subsidiary Banks.

Our subsidiary national banks, and their
subsidiaries, are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and also by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the FRB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB), the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The
foreign branches and representative offices of our subsidiary national banks
are subject to regulation and examination by their respective foreign financial
regulators as well as by the OCC and the FRB. Foreign subsidiaries of our
national bank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the
foreign countries in which they conduct business. Our state-chartered bank

is subject to primary federal regulation and
examination by the FDIC and, in addition, is regulated and examined by its

state banking department.

Nonbank Subsidiaries.

Many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also
subject to regulation by the FRB and other applicable federal and state
agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable
state insurance regulatory agencies, as well as the FRB. Our brokerage
subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (FINRA) and, in some cases, the CFTC and the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board, and state securities regulators. Our other nonbank
subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal
government and/or the various states as well as foreign countries in which they
conduct business.

Parent Bank Holding Company Activities

“Financial in Nature” Requirement.

We became a financial holding company
effective March 13, 2000. We continue to maintain our status as a bank
holding company for purposes of other FRB regulations. As a bank holding
company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the BHC Act, we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other
activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to
activities that are financial in nature. “Financial in nature” activities
include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual
funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant
banking; and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the
U.S. Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such
financial activity. “Complementary activities” are activities that the FRB
determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do
not pose a safety and soundness risk.

FRB approval is not generally required for
us to acquire a company (other than a bank holding company, bank or savings
association) engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental
to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior
notice to the FRB may be required, however, if the company to be acquired has
total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Prior FRB approval is
required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than
5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding
company, bank or savings association. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) also prohibits our ability
to merge, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or acquire control
of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed
10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies.

Because we are a financial holding company,
if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), of less than satisfactory, we will
be prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better, from
engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding
companies, banks or savings associations, except that we could engage in new
activities, or acquire companies engaged in activities, that are closely
related to banking under the BHC Act. In addition, if the FRB finds that the
Company or any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well
managed, we would be required to enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply
with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain
additional limitations or conditions. Until corrected, we could be prohibited
from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities
that are not closely related to banking under the BHC Act without prior FRB
approval. If we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period,
the FRB could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or, in the
alternative, to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related
to banking under the BHC Act.


Interstate Banking

.  Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and
Branching Act (Riegle-Neal Act), a bank holding company may acquire banks in
states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the
bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to
exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company not
control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the
total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or,
unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the
state, more than 30%

of such
deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state).

The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to
merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate branches. Banks are also
permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states.

Regulatory Approval.

In determining whether to approve a proposed
bank acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other
factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, and
future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the
competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance
with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be
served, including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and
the risk to the stability of the United States banking system.

Dividend Restrictions

The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary
banks and other subsidiaries. A significant source of funds to pay dividends on
our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is
dividends from the Parent’s subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory
provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent’s
subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory
approval. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the
Parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in
conducting their businesses. The payment of dividends, depending on the
financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or
unsound practice. The ability of the Parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends
in the future is currently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory
policies and capital guidelines. For information about the restrictions
applicable to the Parent’s subsidiary banks, see Note 3 (Cash, Loan and
Dividend Restrictions) to Financial Statements included in the 2013

Annual Report to Stockholders.

In addition to these restrictions on the
ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us, the FRB finalized rules
in late December 2011 that require large bank holding companies (BHCs),
including Wells Fargo, to submit annual capital plans and to obtain regulatory
approval before making capital distributions, such as the payment of dividends.
The FRB also finalized rules in July 2013 implementing in the United States the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s regulatory capital guidelines,
including the reforms known as Basel III. These rules introduce new capital
conservation buffer requirements. The failure to maintain the capital buffers,
once effective, could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to
make capital distributions.

A number of regulatory proposals are also
under consideration that could further limit our ability to pay dividends. In
late 2011 the FRB proposed enhanced regulations for large BHCs like Wells Fargo
that would impose capital distribution restrictions, including on the payment
of dividends, upon the occurrence of capital, stress test, risk management, or
liquidity risk management triggers. Federal banking regulators are also
considering proposals that would impose an enhanced supplementary leverage
ratio requirement on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and our insured depository
institutions. Under the proposal, we would be required to maintain a supplementary
leverage ratio of at least 5% in order to avoid restrictions on capital
distributions and discretionary bonus payments.

Holding Company Structure

Transfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks.

The Parent’s subsidiary banks are subject
to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other
items of value from such subsidiaries to the Parent and its nonbank
subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called “covered transactions.” In
general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit,
investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions
involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for
the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions
by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the
subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered
transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank’s
capital and surplus. Also, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates
generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral. A bank’s
transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on
arm’s length terms.

Source of Strength.

The FRB has a policy that a BHC is expected
to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its
subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to
support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when
the BHC may not have the resources to provide the support.

The OCC may order an assessment of the
Parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become
impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three months, the
OCC could order the sale of the Parent’s stock in the national bank to cover
the deficiency.

Depositor Preference.

In the event of the “liquidation or other
resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of deposits
payable in the United States (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of
insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC
as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against
the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, claims of insured
and uninsured U.S. depositors, along with claims of the FDIC, will have
priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors, including the Parent, and
depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution’s
non-U.S. offices.

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions.

All of the Company’s subsidiary banks are
insured by the FDIC. FDIC-insured depository


institutions
can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be
incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an FDIC-insured depository
institution controlled by the same bank holding company, and for any assistance
provided by the FDIC to an FDIC-insured depository institution that is in
danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company.
“Default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. “In
danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions
indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.

Dodd-Frank Act

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted on July 21, 2010, will result in broad
changes to the U.S. financial system and is the most significant financial
reform legislation since the 1930s. Federal regulatory agencies have issued
numerous rulemakings to implement its provisions, but a number of the
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act still require final rulemaking or additional
guidance and interpretation by these agencies. As a result, the ultimate impact
of the Dodd-Frank Act is not yet known, but it has affected, and we expect it
will continue to affect most of our businesses in some way, either directly
through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration
risks, capital or liquidity. At the enterprise level, the FRB has finalized a
number of regulations designed to prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise
from the material distress or failure of a large BHC. These rules implement
enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo regarding
risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, and stress
testing and would impose debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators
determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States.
The FRB has also proposed, but not yet finalized, additional enhanced
prudential standards that would implement single counterparty credit limits and
establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial
distress.

In addition to requiring rules for the
enhanced supervision and regulation of large BHCs and other systemically
important firms, the Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FDIC and FRB to implement
rules requiring large BHCs like Wells Fargo to prepare and submit resolution
plans, known as “living wills,” to facilitate the rapid and orderly resolution
of the Company in the event of material distress or its failure. Under the rules implemented by the FDIC and
FRB in this regard, Wells Fargo submitted its resolution plan on June 29, 2013.
If the FRB and FDIC determine that our resolution plan is deficient, the
Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the FRB and FDIC to impose more stringent capital,
leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth or activities
until we submit a plan remedying the deficiencies. If the FRB and FDIC
ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy the deficiencies, they
could order us to divest assets or operations in order to facilitate our
orderly resolution in the event of our material distress or failure. Our
national bank subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is also required to prepare a
resolution plan for the FDIC under separate regulatory authority and submitted
the plan on June 29, 2013.

The FDIC also recently released a notice
regarding a proposed resolution strategy, known as “single point of entry,”
designed to resolve a large financial institution in a manner that holds
management responsible for its failure, maintains market stability, and imposes
losses on shareholders and creditors in accordance with statutory priorities,
without imposing a cost on U.S. taxpayers. Implementation of the strategy would
require that institutions maintain a sufficient amount of available equity and
unsecured debt to absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. The
FDIC has requested public comment on this proposed resolution strategy.

Federal regulatory agencies have also recently
finalized rules to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act known as the
“Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule substantially restricts banking entities from
engaging in proprietary trading or owning any interest in or sponsoring or
having certain relationships with a hedge fund, a private equity fund or
certain structured transactions that are deemed covered funds. Wells Fargo is
not required to come into compliance with the Volcker Rule’s restrictions until
July 21, 2015, but we will be required to report certain trading metrics
beginning June 30, 2014. During the conformance period, banking entities are
expected to engage in “good faith” planning efforts, appropriate for their
activities and investments, to enable them to conform all of their activities
and investments to the Volcker Rule’s restrictions by no later than July 21,
2015. As a banking entity with more than $50 billion in consolidated assets,
Wells Fargo will also be subject to enhanced compliance program requirements.

With respect to consumer protection maters,
the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to ensure consumers receive clear and
accurate disclosures regarding financial products and to protect consumers from
hidden fees and unfair or abusive practices.

The CFPB concentrated much of its initial rulemaking efforts on a
variety of mortgage-related topics required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including

ability-to-repay and qualified
mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation
standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, appraisal and escrow standards and
requirements for higher-priced mortgages. The CFPB also recently finalized rules
integrating disclosures required of lenders and settlement agents under the
Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. In addition
to the exercise of its rulemaking authority, the CFPB is continuing its
on-going examination activities with respect to a number of consumer businesses
and products, including credit card add-on products, fair lending requirements,
and student lending activities.

Federal regulatory agencies issued numerous other
proposals to implement various other requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act,
including rules issued by the CFTC and SEC establishing a comprehensive
framework for regulating over-the-counter derivatives. Many other proposals
have not yet been finalized, including proposed rules requiring sponsors of
asset-backed securities (ABS) to retain an ownership stake in the ABS. In
addition, both the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the SEC are
considering additional regulations to address perceived risks that money market
mutual funds may pose to the financial stability of the United States. Although
we have analyzed these and other proposed rules, the absence of final rules
makes it difficult for us to fully estimate their impact on the Company

.

Capital Requirements

The
Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking
regulators. In July 2013, federal banking regulators issued final rules that
substantially amended the risk-based capital rules for banking organizations.
The rules implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in the U.S.,
comply with


changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, and
replace the existing Basel I-based capital requirements. These final capital
rules, among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital
to different categories of assets and exposures. We were required to begin
complying with the rules on January 1, 2014, subject to phase-in periods that
are scheduled to be fully phased in by January 1, 2022. Federal banking
regulators have also issued proposals to impose a supplementary leverage ratio
on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and our insured depository institutions and to
implement a liquidity coverage ratio. Our capital adequacy assessment process
contemplates a wide range of risks that the Company is exposed to and also
takes into consideration our performance under a variety of stressed economic
conditions, as well as regulatory expectations and guidance, rating agency
viewpoints and the view of capital markets participants.

From time to time, the FRB and
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) propose changes
and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital guidelines
and related reporting instructions. In addition, the FRB closely monitors
capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such
institutions to modify capital levels based on FRB determinations. Such
determinations, proposals or interpretations could, if implemented in the future,
affect our reported capital ratios and net risk-adjusted assets.

As an additional means to
identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) requires federal banking regulators to establish
certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which
they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to
operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure, executive
compensation and risk management. The agencies are authorized to take action
against institutions that fail to meet such standards.

The FDI Act requires federal banking
regulators to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to FDIC-insured
depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. A
depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action
provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital
measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation.

Capital Planning

In
late 2011, the FRB finalized rules to require large BHCs to submit capital
plans annually for review to determine if the FRB had any objections before
making any capital distributions.

The
rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a
BHC’s risk profile, including as a result of any significant acquisitions.

On March 14, 2013, the FRB
notified us that it did not object to our 2013 capital plan included in the
2013 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). Since the FRB
notification, the Company took several capital actions, including increasing
its quarterly common stock dividend rate to $0.30 per share, redeeming Wachovia
Preferred Funding Corp. preferred securities that will no longer count as Tier
1 capital under the Dodd-Frank Act and the final Basel III capital standards,
and repurchasing shares of our common stock.

Our 2014 CCAR, which was
submitted on January 3, 2014, included a comprehensive capital plan supported
by an assessment of expected uses and sources of capital over a given planning
horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios, similar to the process
the FRB used to conduct the CCAR in 2013. As part of the 2014 CCAR, the FRB
also generated a supervisory stress test, which assumed a sharp decline in the
economy and significant decline in asset pricing using the information provided
by the Company to estimate performance. The FRB is expected to review the
supervisory stress results both as required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a
common set of capital actions for all large BHCs and by taking into account the
Company’s proposed capital actions. The FRB has indicated that it will publish
its supervisory stress test results as required under the Dodd-Frank Act, and
the related CCAR results, taking into account the Company’s proposed capital
actions, in March 2014.

Deposit Insurance Assessments

Our bank subsidiaries, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., are members of
the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the
FDIC insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor.
The DIF was formed March 31, 2006, upon the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund
and the Savings Insurance Fund in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance
Reform Act of 2005 (the FDIR Act). The FDIR Act established a range of 1.15% to
1.50% within which the FDIC Board of Directors may set the Designated Reserve
Ratio (reserve ratio or DRR). The FDIR Act also granted the FDIC Board the
discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured
institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio.

The Dodd-Frank Act gave the FDIC greater
discretion to manage the DIF, raised the minimum DRR to 1.35% and removed the
upper limit of the range. In October 2010, the FDIC Board adopted a Restoration
Plan to ensure that the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020,
as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. At the same time, the FDIC Board proposed a
comprehensive, long-range plan for DIF management. In December 2010, as
part of the comprehensive plan, the FDIC Board adopted a final rule to set the
DRR at 2%, and in February 2011, the FDIC Board approved the remainder of the
comprehensive plan.

On February 7, 2011, the FDIC Board approved
a final rule on assessments, dividends, assessment base and large bank pricing
that took effect on April 1, 2011. To maintain the DIF, member institutions are
assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an

assessment rate. Generally, the assessment
base is an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average
tangible equity. For large and highly complex institutions (those that are very
large and are structurally and operationally complex or that pose unique
challenges and risks in the case of failure), the assessment rate is determined
by combining supervisory ratings and certain financial measures into
scorecards. The score received by an institution is converted into an
assessment rate for the institution. The FDIC retains the ability to adjust the
total score of large and highly complex institutions based upon quantitative or
qualitative measures not adequately captured in the scorecards.

All FDIC-insured depository institutions
must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds issued
by the Financing Corporation, a federal corporation chartered under the
authority of the Federal Housing Finance Board. The bonds (commonly referred to as FICO bonds) were
used to capitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.
This assessment was 0.64% of the assessable deposit base during 2013, and


is 0.62% of the assessable deposit base for first quarter
2014. For the year ended
December 31, 2013, the Company’s FDIC deposit insurance assessments, including
FICO assessments, totaled $1.0 billion.

The FDIC may terminate a depository
institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial
condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or
unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or
condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency. The
termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could
have a material adverse effect on our earnings, depending on the collective
size of the particular banks involved.

Fiscal
and Monetary Policies

Our business and earnings are affected significantly by the
fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. We are
particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of
money and credit in the United States. Among the instruments of monetary policy
available to the FRB are (a) conducting open market operations in United States
government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository
institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository
institutions’ deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements
against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These methods are
used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of
bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and
paid on deposits. The policies of the FRB may have a material effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Privacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and
Restrictions on Cross-Selling

Federal banking regulators, as required under the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act), have adopted rules limiting the ability
of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information
about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of
privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to
prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third
parties. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information
is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to
outside vendors. Federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the
Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act that have the effect of increasing
the length of the waiting period, after privacy disclosures are provided to new
customers, before information can be shared among different affiliated
companies for the purpose of cross-selling products and services between those
affiliated companies.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented a broad
range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility,
to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at
publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy
and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws. We are subject to
Sarbanes-Oxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and/or its
implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional
responsibilities for our audit committee, imposed restrictions on the
relationship between us and our outside auditors (including restrictions on the
types of non-audit services our auditors may provide to us), imposed additional
responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, expanded the disclosure requirements for
our corporate insiders, required our management to evaluate our disclosure
controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and
required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on
our internal control over financial reporting.

Patriot Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools
Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) is
intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and
intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of
fronts. The Patriot Act has significant implications for depository
institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of
money. The Patriot Act required us to implement new or revised policies and
procedures relating to anti‑money laundering, compliance, suspicious
activities, and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers.
The Patriot Act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the
effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining
whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition.

Future Legislation or Regulation

In light of recent conditions in the U.S. and global financial markets
and the U.S. and global economy, legislators, the presidential administration
and regulators have continued their increased focus on regulation of the
financial services industry. Proposals that further increase regulation of the
financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be
introduced in the U.S. Congress,

in
state legislatures and abroad. In addition, not all regulations authorized or
required under the Dodd-Frank Act have been proposed or finalized by federal
regulators. Further legislative changes and additional regulations may

change

our operating environment in substantial and
unpredictable ways. Such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of
doing business, affect our compensation structure, restrict or expand the
activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among
banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions.
We cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and, if
enacted, the effect that they, or any implementing regulations, would have on
our business, results of operations or financial condition. The same uncertainty
exists with respect to regulations authorized or required under the Dodd-Frank
Act but that have not yet been proposed or finalized.

and is incorporated herein by reference. Prices shown represent the daily high
and low, and the quarter-end sale prices of the Company’s common stock as
reported on the NYSE Composite Transaction Reporting System for the periods
indicated. The “Stock Performance” section of the 2013 Annual Report to

incorporated into this item by reference.

REPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

In October 2012, our Board of Directors authorized
the repurchase of 200 million shares of our common stock. The authorization
covers shares repurchased to meet team member benefit plan requirements.

The Company maintains a variety of
retirement plans for its team members and typically is a net issuer of shares
of common stock to these plans. From time to time, it also purchases shares of
common stock from these plans to accommodate team member preferences. Share
repurchases are subtracted from the Company’s repurchase authority without
offset for share issuances. Shares may be repurchased as part of employee stock
option exercises, from the different benefit plans or in the open market,
subject to regulatory approval.

The amount and timing of stock repurchases
will be based on various factors, including our capital requirements, the
number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and
acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and
regulatory and legal considerations. In June 2010, our Board of Directors also
authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of warrants to purchase our
common stock. The warrants are listed on the NYSE under the symbol “WFCWS.” The
amount and timing of warrant repurchases will be based on various factors
including market conditions.

See the
“Capital Management” section in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders for
additional information about our common stock and warrant repurchases.

  merger. Under these assumed plans a total of 1,483,828 shares of common stock
  were issuable upon exercise of options. The weighted average exercise price
  per share of our common stock of the outstanding options was $103.04. We
  assumed the amended and restated Wachovia Corporation 2003 Stock Incentive
  Plan (2003 SIP) in the Wachovia merger and in February 2009 used substantially
  all remaining available shares for stock option grants to legacy Wachovia
  team members. Information for the 2003 SIP is included in the table above

Material Features of Equity Compensation Plans Not
Approved by Stockholders

The 2003 SIP

.  The amended and restated Wachovia
Corporation 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (2003 SIP) was originally approved by
Wachovia’s shareholders in 2003 and prior to the merger had been used for
equity awards to Wachovia’s executive officers and other key employees. We
assumed the 2003 SIP in the merger and in February 2009 used substantially all
remaining available shares for stock option grants to legacy Wachovia team
members. No awards have been granted since then, and no future awards will be
granted under the 2003 SIP.

At December 31, 2013, only options and stock
awards in the form of RSAs were outstanding under the 2003 SIP. The options
generally expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date and vest ratably
over a three-year period from the grant date. The option price is payable to us
in full by methods the Board’s Human Resources Committee (HRC) designates,
including, but not limited to, in cash or its equivalent, by tendering or
withholding shares of our common stock having a fair market value at the time
of exercise equal to the total option price, or by a combination of the
foregoing. Unless the HRC determines otherwise or except as prohibited by
applicable law, options may also be exercised by a “cashless exercise” where
the participant gives irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly


deliver to us the amount of sale proceeds from the shares
covered by the option exercised, together with any withholding taxes due to the
Company. The proceeds from any cash payments upon option exercise are added to
our general funds and used for general corporate purposes. The outstanding RSAs
vest upon the achievement of the specified performance criteria. Prior to
vesting, the holders of RSAs may exercise full voting rights with respect to
those shares and are entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions
paid with respect to those shares. Each participant’s award agreement will
state the extent, if any, to which the participant may receive unvested stock
awards following termination of employment.

Deferred Compensation Plan

.  Under the Deferred Compensation
Plan eligible team members may defer receipt of salary, bonuses and certain
other compensation subject to the terms of the plan. Deferral elections are
irrevocable once made except for limited re-deferral opportunities. We treat
amounts deferred by a participant as if invested in the earnings options
selected by the participant, and determine the deferred compensation benefit
payable to the participant based on the performance of those earnings options.
The plan offers a number of earnings options, including one based on our common
stock with dividends reinvested. We generally distribute amounts allocated to
the common stock option in shares of common stock. Participants have no direct
interest in any of the earnings options and are general unsecured creditors of
the Company with respect to their deferred compensation benefits under the plan.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for
Independent Contractors

.  Under
the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Independent Contractors
participants who perform qualifying investment or other financial services for
participating affiliates as independent contractors may defer all or part of
their eligible compensation payable to them by the affiliate subject to the
terms of the plan. Deferral elections are irrevocable once made. Amounts
deferred by a participant are treated as if invested in the earnings options
selected by the participant, which determine the deferred compensation benefit
payable to the participant. The plan offers a number of earnings options,
including one based on our common stock with dividends reinvested. We generally
distribute amounts allocated to the common stock option in shares of common
stock. The plan is sponsored by a wholly owned subsidiary, WF Deferred
Compensation Holdings, Inc. We have guaranteed its obligations under the plan.
Participants have no direct interest in any of the earnings options and are
general unsecured creditors of the plan sponsor and the Company with respect to
their deferred compensation benefits under the plan.

Norwest Corporation Directors’ Formula Stock Award Plan

.  Under the Norwest Corporation Directors’
Formula Stock Award Plan we awarded shares of common stock to non-employee
directors. The plan allowed participants to defer receipt of all or a portion
of their awards, with dividends reinvested, until a future year or years as selected
by the participants subject to the terms of the plan. Participants can elect
one time to defer commencement of distribution of their deferral accounts if
the election is made sufficiently in advance of the original distribution
commencement date and the new distribution commencement date is sufficiently
beyond the original distribution commencement date. Participants have no direct
interest in the shares deferred under the plan and are general unsecured
creditors of the Company with respect to payment of their deferred stock awards
under the plan. No future stock awards or deferrals may be made under this
plan.

Norwest Corporation Directors’ Stock Deferral Plan

.  Under the Norwest Corporation
Directors’ Stock Deferral Plan a participating director could defer receipt of
all or part of the annual cash retainer and meeting fees payable to the
director until a future year or years as selected by the director subject to
the terms of the plan. A participating director could elect distribution of his
or her deferral account in a lump sum in either cash or whole shares of common
stock, or a combination of both. Alternatively, the director could elect to
receive the distribution in up to ten annual installments of cash. A
participant can elect one time to defer commencement of distribution of his or
her deferral account if the election is made sufficiently in advance of the
original distribution commencement date and the new distribution commencement
date is sufficiently beyond the original distribution commencement date. No
future deferrals may be made under this plan.
