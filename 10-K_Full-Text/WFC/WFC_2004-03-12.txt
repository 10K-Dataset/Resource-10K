DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

General

Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services company organized
under the laws of Delaware and registered as a bank holding company and
financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (BHC Act). Based on assets at December 31, 2003, it was the fifth
largest bank holding company in the United States. In this report, Wells Fargo
& Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated) is referred to as the Company and
Wells Fargo & Company alone is referred to as the Parent.

The Company engages in banking and a variety of related financial services
businesses. Retail, commercial and corporate banking services are provided
through banking stores in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington,
Wisconsin and Wyoming. Other financial services are provided by subsidiaries
engaged in various businesses, principally: wholesale banking, mortgage
banking, consumer finance, equipment leasing, agricultural finance, commercial
finance, securities brokerage and investment banking, insurance agency
services, computer and data processing services, trust services,
mortgage-backed securities servicing and venture capital investment.

In November 2003, the Company received federal regulatory approval to
consolidate 19 of its nationally chartered banks into a single, national
community bank charter. The Company consolidated banks with stores in six
states (Alaska, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, Texas and Wyoming) with and into
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., whose stores already serviced customers primarily in
California. The Company completed the consolidation in February 2004, which
also included transfers of certain stores in Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Washington
to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

The Company has three operating segments for management reporting purposes:
Community Banking, Wholesale Banking and Wells Fargo Financial. The 2003 Annual
Report to Stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these
operating segments.

The Company had 140,000 full-time equivalent team members at December 31, 2003.

History and Growth

The Company is the product of the merger involving Norwest Corporation and the
former Wells Fargo & Company, completed on November 2, 1998 (the WFC Merger).
On completion of the WFC Merger, Norwest Corporation changed its name to Wells
Fargo & Company.

Norwest Corporation was organized in 1929 under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Prior to the WFC Merger, it provided banking services to customers in
16 states and additional financial services through subsidiaries engaged in a
variety of businesses including mortgage banking and consumer finance.


The former Wells Fargo & Company’s principal subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A., was the successor to the banking portion of the business founded by Henry
Wells and William G. Fargo in 1852. That business later operated the
westernmost leg of the Pony Express and ran stagecoach lines in the western
part of the United States. The California banking business was separated from
the express business in 1905, merged in 1960 with American Trust Company,
another of the oldest banks in the Western United States, and became Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association, in 1968.

In April 1996, the former Wells Fargo & Company acquired First Interstate
Bancorp, a $55 billion bank holding company in a transaction valued at $11
billion. In October 2000, the Company acquired First Security Corporation, a
$23 billion bank holding company in a transaction valued at $3 billion.

The Company expands its business, in part, by acquiring banking institutions
and other companies engaged in activities that are financial in nature. The
Company continues to explore opportunities to acquire banking institutions and
other financial services companies. Discussions are continually being carried
on related to such possible acquisitions. The Company cannot predict whether,
or on what terms, such discussions will result in further acquisitions. As a
matter of policy, the Company generally does not comment on such discussions or
possible acquisitions until a definitive acquisition agreement has been signed.

Competition

The financial services industry is highly competitive. The Company’s
subsidiaries compete with financial services providers, such as banks, savings
and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage banking
companies, insurance companies, and money market and mutual fund companies.
They also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as
brokerage houses and insurance companies, as well as from financial services
subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies. Many of these
competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost
structures.

Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding
companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. Acquisitions of
this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which the
Company conducts business. The financial services industry is also likely to
become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies
to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the
importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the
transfer of funds between parties.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

The following discussion, together with Notes 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend
Restrictions) and 26 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial
Statements included in the 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders sets forth the
material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding
companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain information specific to
us. This regulatory framework is intended to protect depositors, federal
deposit


insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, and not to protect security
holders. To the extent that the information describes statutory and regulatory
provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to those provisions.
Further, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review
by Congress and state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies.
A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us,
including changes in interpretation or implementation thereof, could have a
material effect on the Company’s business.

Applicable laws and regulations could restrict our ability to diversify into
other areas of financial services, acquire depository institutions, and pay
dividends on our capital stock. The Company may also be required to provide
financial support to one or more of its subsidiary banks, maintain capital
balances in excess of those desired by management, and pay higher deposit
insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial
condition of depository institutions.

General

Parent Bank Holding Company.

As a bank holding company, the Parent is subject
to regulation under the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and supervision
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board
or FRB).

Subsidiary Banks.

The Company’s national subsidiary banks are subject to
regulation and examination primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency (OCC) and secondarily by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) and the FRB. The Company’s state-chartered banks are subject to primary
federal regulation and examination by the FDIC and, in addition, are regulated
and examined by their respective state banking departments.

Nonbank Subsidiaries.

Many of the Company’s nonbank subsidiaries are also
subject to regulation by the FRB and other applicable federal and state
agencies. The Company’s brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. and state securities regulators. The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are
subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies. The
Company’s other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations
of the federal government and/or the various states in which they conduct
business.


Parent Bank Holding Company Activities

“Financial in Nature” Requirement.

As a bank holding company that has elected
to become a financial holding company pursuant to the BHC Act, the Company may
affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other
activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to
activities that are financial in nature. “Financial in nature” activities
include securities underwriting, dealing and market making, sponsoring mutual
funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency, merchant
banking, and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the
U.S. Treasury, determines from time to time to be financial in nature or
incidental to such financial activity or is complementary to a financial
activity and does not pose a safety and soundness risk.

FRB approval is not required for the Company to acquire a company (other than a
bank holding company, bank or savings association) engaged in activities that
are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in
nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior FRB approval is required before the
Company may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the
voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company,
bank or savings association.

Because the Company is a financial holding company, if any of its subsidiary
banks ceases to be “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable
regulatory standards, the FRB may, among other actions, order the Company to
divest the subsidiary bank. Alternatively, the Company may elect to restrict
its activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also
a financial holding company.

Also, because the Company is a financial holding company, if any of our
subsidiary banks receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of
1977, as amended (CRA), of less than satisfactory, the Company will be
prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better, from engaging
in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies,
banks or savings associations, except that the Company could engage in new
activities, or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related
to banking under the BHC Act.

The Company became a financial holding company effective March 13, 2000. It
continues to maintain its status as a bank holding company for purposes of
other FRB regulations.

Interstate Banking

. Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Act
(Riegle-Neal Act), a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other
than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been
organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years,
and the requirement that the bank holding company not control, prior to or
following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of
deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the
acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state, more
than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by
the state).


The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby
creating interstate branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to
establish new branches in other states where authorized under the laws of those
states.

Regulatory Approval.

In determining whether to approve a proposed bank
acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the
effect of the acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be
received from the acquisition, the projected capital ratios and levels on a
post-acquisition basis, and the acquiring institution’s record of addressing
the credit needs of the communities it serves, including the needs of low and
moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of
the bank, under the CRA.

Dividend Restrictions

The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks
and other subsidiaries. Its principal source of funds to pay dividends on its
common and preferred stock and principal and interest on its debt is dividends
from its subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions and
regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent’s subsidiary banks and
certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. For information
about the restrictions applicable to the Parent’s subsidiary banks, see Note 3
(Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions) to Financial Statements included in the
2003 Annual Report to Stockholders.

Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Parent’s
subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting
their businesses. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial
condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound
practice. The ability of the Parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the
future is currently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory
policies and capital guidelines.

Holding Company Structure

Transfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks.

The Parent’s subsidiary banks are
subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or
other items of value from such subsidiaries to the Parent and its nonbank
subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called “covered transactions.” In
general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit,
investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions
involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for
the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions
by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the
subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered
transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank’s
capital and surplus. Also, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates
generally are required to be secured in specified amounts. A bank’s
transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on
arm’s length terms.

Source of Strength.

The FRB has a policy that a bank holding company is
expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its
subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to
support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be


required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to
provide the support.

The OCC may order the assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its
national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay
the assessment within three months, the OCC could order the sale of the
Parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency.

Capital loans by the Parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in
right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary
bank. In addition, in the event of the Parent’s bankruptcy, any commitment by
the Parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a
subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a
priority of payment.

Depositor Preference.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) provides
that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured
depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including
the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims
for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over
other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured
depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the
FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, nondeposit creditors,
including the Parent, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made
to such insured depository institution.

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions.

All of the Parent’s banks are
insured by the FDIC. FDIC-insured depository institutions can be held liable
for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due
to the default of an FDIC-insured depository institution controlled by the same
bank holding company, and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an
FDIC-insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is
controlled by the same bank holding company. “Default” means generally the
appointment of a conservator or receiver. “In danger of default” means
generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is
likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.

Capital Requirements

The Parent is subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed
by the FRB, which are substantially similar to the capital requirements and
guidelines imposed by the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC on depository institutions
within their jurisdictions. For information about these capital requirements
and guidelines, see Note 26 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to
Financial Statements included in the 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders.

The FRB may set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose
circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal
growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions
substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant
reliance on intangible assets. Also, the FRB considers a “tangible Tier 1
leverage ratio” (deducting all intangibles) and other indications of capital
strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or engaging in new activities.


Effective April 1, 2002, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued new rules governing the
capital treatment of nonfinancial equity investments, which includes
investments made by the Company’s venture capital subsidiaries. The rules
impose a capital charge that increases incrementally as the level of
nonfinancial equity investments increases relative to Tier 1 capital. For
covered investments that total less than 15% of Tier 1 capital, the rules
require a Tier 1 capital charge of 8% of the adjusted carrying value of the
covered investments. For covered investments that total 15% or more but less
than 25%, the Tier 1 capital charge is 12%, and for covered investments that
total 25% or more, the Tier 1 capital charge is 25%. The new rules have not had
a material impact on the Company.

Historically, issuer trusts that issued trust preferred securities have been
consolidated by their parent companies and trust preferred securities have been
treated as eligible for Tier 1 capital treatment by bank holding companies
under FRB rules and regulations relating to minority interests in equity
accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Applying the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

we deconsolidated the issuer
trusts as of December 31, 2003. In a Supervisory Letter dated July 2, 2003, the
FRB stated that trust preferred securities continue to qualify as Tier 1
capital until notice is given to the contrary. The FRB will review the
regulatory implications of any accounting treatment changes and will provide
further guidance if necessary or warranted.

FRB, FDIC and OCC rules also require the Company to incorporate market and
interest rate risk components into its regulatory capital computations. Under
the market risk requirements, capital is allocated to support the amount of
market risk related to a financial institution’s ongoing trading activities.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision continues to evaluate certain
aspects of the proposed New Basel Capital Accord. The New Basel Capital Accord
incorporates three pillars that address (a) minimum capital requirements, (b)
supervisory review, which relates to an institution’s capital adequacy and
internal assessment process, and (c) market discipline, through effective
disclosure to encourage safe and sound banking practices. Embodied within these
pillars are aspects of risk assessment that relate to credit risk, interest
rate risk, operational risk, among others, and certain proposed approaches by
the Basel Committee to complete such assessments may be considered complex. The
Company continues to monitor the status of the New Basel Capital Accord.

From time to time, the FRB and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council (FFIEC) propose changes and amendments to, and issue interpretations
of, risk-based capital guidelines and related reporting instructions. Such
proposals or interpretations could, if implemented in the future, affect the
Company’s reported capital ratios and net risk-adjusted assets.

As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of
depository institutions, the FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies
to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for
institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards
relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate
exposure


and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against
institutions that fail to meet such standards.

The FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt
corrective action” with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do
not meet minimum capital requirements. A depository institution’s treatment for
purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its
capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors,
as established by regulation.

Deposit Insurance Assessments

Through the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance
Fund (SAIF), the FDIC insures the deposits of the Parent’s depository
institution subsidiaries up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The amount
of FDIC assessments paid by a BIF and SAIF member institution is based on its
relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other
factors. Specifically, the assessment rate is based on the institution’s
capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category. An
institution’s capitalization risk category is based on the FDIC’s determination
of whether the institution is well capitalized, adequately capitalized or less
than adequately capitalized. An institution’s supervisory subgroup category is
based on the FDIC’s assessment of the financial condition of the institution
and the probability that FDIC intervention or other corrective action will be
required.

The BIF and SAIF assessment rate currently ranges from zero to 27 cents per
$100 of domestic deposits. The BIF and SAIF assessment rate for the Parent’s
depository institutions currently is zero. The FDIC may increase or decrease
the assessment rate schedule on a semi-annual basis. An increase in the
assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on the Parent’s earnings,
depending on the amount of the increase. The FDIC is authorized to terminate a
depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the
institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution
has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule,
regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s
regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for one or more of the
Parent’s subsidiary depository institutions could have a material adverse
effect on the Parent’s earnings, depending on the collective size of the
particular institutions involved.

All FDIC-insured depository institutions must pay an annual assessment to
provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the Financing
Corporation, a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the Federal
Housing Finance Board. The bonds (commonly referred to as FICO bonds) were
issued to capitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.
FDIC-insured depository institutions paid approximately 1.6 cents per $100 of
BIF-assessable deposits in 2003. The FDIC established the FICO assessment rate
effective for the first quarter of 2004 at approximately 1.5 cents annually per
$100 of assessable deposits.

Fiscal and Monetary Policies

The Company’s business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal
and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. The Company
is particularly affected by the


policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the
United States. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB
are (a) conducting open market operations in United States government
securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository
institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository
institutions’ deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements
against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These methods are
used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of
bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and
paid on deposits. The policies of the FRB may have a material effect on the
Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Privacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act

Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the
GLB Act), have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial
institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated
third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers
and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain
personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of
the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified
financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors.

Future Legislation

Various legislation, including proposals to change substantially the financial
institution regulatory system, is from time to time introduced in Congress.
This legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of
the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, this legislation
could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand
permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings
associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company
cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted and,
if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on
the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.


ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME

The following table allocates the changes in net interest income on a
taxable-equivalent basis to changes in either average balances or average rates
for both interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Because of
the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during any period, it is not
possible to precisely allocate such changes between volume and rate. For this
table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated
to these categories in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume
and average rate.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

Indicators of the credit quality of our loan portfolio and the method of
determining the allowance for loan losses are discussed below and in greater
detail in the 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders. The ratio of the allowance to
net charge-offs was 226% and 228% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
This ratio is indicative of stable or improving loss rates within the various
business lines during 2003 and is directionally consistent with a generally
improved and less volatile economic environment compared with the prior year.
The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total nonaccrual loans was 267%
and 256% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This ratio may fluctuate
significantly from period to period due to such factors as the mix of loan
types in the portfolio, borrower credit strength and the value and
marketability of collateral.

See Note 5 (Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses) to Financial Statements
included in the 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders for a description of the
process used by the Company to determine the adequacy and the components
(allocated and unallocated) of the allowance for loan losses.

At December 31, 2003, the allowance for loan losses was $3,891 million, or
1.54% of total loans, compared with $3,819 million, or 1.98%, at December 31,
2002. During 2003, the net provision for loan losses approximated charge-offs.
The components of the allowance, allocated and unallocated, are shown in the
table on the previous page. The allocated component increased to $3,072 million
at December 31, 2003 from $2,535 million at December 31, 2002, while the
unallocated decreased to $819 million at December 31, 2003 from $1,284 million
at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003, the unallocated portion of the
allowance was 21% of the total allowance, compared with 34% at December 31,
2002.

The allocated component of the allowance increased $537 million from 2002 to
2003. Two-thirds of the increase, or $373 million, was attributable to consumer
loan growth, primarily other revolving credit and installment loans and, to a
lesser extent, growth in residential 1-4 family first and junior lien
mortgages. The remaining $164 million increase in allocated allowance also
reflected loan growth as well as changes in the loan mix and risk profiles
within commercial business lines, including an increase in the total allowance
of $72 million from acquisitions. Changes in allocated loan loss allowances
reflect management’s judgment concerning the effect of trends in borrower
performance and recent economic activity on portfolio performance.

The unallocated component of the allowance decreased $465 million from 2002 to
2003, primarily due to the changing mix and portfolio growth previously
mentioned. The growth in consumer loans, including home mortgages, resulted in
more statistically derived allocated reserves and required less reliance on
judgmental assumptions built into the unallocated component of the allowance.

No material changes in estimation methodology for the allowance were made in
2003.

The Company considers the allowance for loan losses of $3,891 million adequate
to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded
commitments, at December 31, 2003.

The foregoing discussion contains forward-looking statements about the adequacy
of the Company’s allowance for loan losses. These forward-looking statements
are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors—many
beyond our control—could cause actual losses to be more than estimated losses.
For a discussion of some of the other factors that could cause actual losses to
be more than estimated losses, see “Factors That May Affect Future Results” in
the “Financial Review” section of the 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders.
