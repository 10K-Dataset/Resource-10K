General
    Description

Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) was incorporated in 1973
    under the laws of the state of Georgia. Aflac Incorporated is a
    general business holding company and acts as a management
    company, overseeing the operations of its subsidiaries by
    providing management services and making capital available. Its
    principal business is supplemental health and life insurance,
    which is marketed and administered through its subsidiary,
    American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac),
    which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch
    in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflac’s policies are
    individually underwritten and marketed through independent
    agents. Our insurance operations in the United States and our
    branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance
    business.

We believe Aflac is the world’s leading underwriter of
    individually issued policies marketed at worksites. We continue
    to diversify our product offerings in both Japan and the United
    States. Aflac Japan sells supplemental insurance products,
    including cancer life plans, general medical indemnity plans,
    medical/sickness riders, care plans, living benefit life plans,
    ordinary life insurance plans and annuities. Aflac
    U.S. sells supplemental insurance products, including
    accident/disability plans, cancer expense plans, short-term
    disability plans, sickness and hospital indemnity plans,
    hospital intensive care plans, fixed-benefit dental plans,
    vision care plans, long-term care plans, and life insurance
    products.

We are authorized to conduct insurance business in all
    50 states, the District of Columbia, several
    U.S. territories and Japan. Aflac Japan accounted for 71%
    of the Company’s total revenues in 2007, 72% in 2006 and
    74% in 2005. The percentage of total assets attributable to
    Aflac Japan was 82% at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. For
    additional information, see Note 2 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Insurance
    Products - Japan

Aflac Japan’s insurance products are designed to help
    consumers pay for medical and nonmedical costs that are not
    reimbursed under Japan’s national health insurance system.
    Changes in Japan’s economy and an aging population have put
    increasing pressure on Japan’s national health care system.
    As a result, more costs are being shifted to Japanese consumers,
    who in turn have become increasingly interested in insurance
    products that help them manage those costs. Aflac Japan has
    responded to this consumer need by enhancing existing products
    and developing new products.

Aflac Japan’s stand-alone medical product, EVER, offers a
    basic level of hospitalization coverage with an affordable
    premium. Since its initial introduction in 2002, we have
    expanded our suite of EVER product offerings. We added to our
    medical product portfolio in February 2007 with EVER Paid Up, a
    product that allows policyholders to choose to pay higher
    premium payments on the front end so they will be payment-free
    at either age 60 or 65. In August 2007, we introduced
    Gentle EVER, which helps consumers who may have a health
    condition that would exclude them from purchasing the other EVER
    products. We believe that there is an attractive market for this
    type of medical product in Japan. We also believe Gentle EVER
    will be an effective means for us to extend our reach to new
    consumers and further segment the medical market. We continue to
    believe that the entire medical category will remain an
    important part of our product portfolio in Japan.

The cancer life insurance plans we offer in Japan provide a
    lump-sum benefit upon initial diagnosis of internal cancer and a
    fixed daily benefit for hospitalization and outpatient services
    related to cancer as well as surgical, convalescent and terminal
    care benefits. These plans differ from Aflac U.S. cancer
    plans in that the Japanese policies may also provide death
    benefits and cash surrender values. In September 2007, we
    introduced a new product called Cancer Forte. This is the first
    major revision we have made to our cancer product since we
    introduced 21st Century Cancer in 2001. Responding to
    requests for enhanced outpatient coverage for cancer treatment,
    Cancer Forte pays outpatient benefits for 60 days, compared
    with 30 days for our previous plans. It also incorporates
    two new features. First, if a policyholder is diagnosed with
    cancer for the first time, we pay that policyholder an annuity
    from the second year through the fifth year after diagnosis.
    This is in addition to the traditional upfront first-occurrence
    benefit. The second new benefit is called “Premier
    Support,” where Aflac arranges for a third party to provide
    policyholders with counseling and doctor referral services upon
    their cancer diagnosis. In 2006, we designed a new cancer
    product for distribution by

I-3


Dai-ichi Life that is customized for their market. In addition,
    our Rider MAX product provides accident and medical/sickness
    benefits as a rider to our cancer life policy.

The life products that we offer in Japan provide death benefits
    and cash surrender values. These products are available as
    stand-alone policies and riders. Some plans have features that
    allow policyholders to convert a portion of their life insurance
    to medical, nursing care, or fixed annuity benefits at a
    predetermined age.

We also offer traditional fixed-income annuities and care
    policies. For additional information on Aflac Japan’s
    products and composition of sales, see the Aflac Japan section
    of MD&A in this report.

Insurance
    Products - U.S.

We design our U.S. insurance products to provide
    supplemental coverage for people who already have major medical
    or primary insurance coverage. Our policies are portable and pay
    regardless of other insurance. Benefits are paid in cash
    directly to policyholders, therefore they have the opportunity
    to use this cash to cover expenses of their choosing. Our health
    insurance plans are guaranteed-renewable for the lifetime of the
    policyholder (to age 70 for short-term disability
    policies). We cannot cancel guaranteed-renewable coverage, but
    we can increase premium rates on existing policies on a uniform,
    nondiscriminatory basis by class of policy in response to
    adverse experience. Any premium rate increases are subject to
    state regulatory approval. We have had minimal rate increase
    activity in the last five years.

Aflac U.S. offers an accident and disability policy to
    protect against losses resulting from accidents. The accident
    portion of the policy includes lump-sum benefits for accidental
    death, dismemberment and specific injuries as well as fixed
    benefits for hospital confinement. Optional disability riders
    are also available. Short-term disability policies provide
    disability benefits with a variety of elimination and benefit
    period options. The longest such benefit period offered is two
    years.

Our U.S. cancer plans are designed to provide insurance
    benefits for medical and nonmedical costs that are not covered
    by major medical insurance. Benefits include a first-occurrence
    benefit that pays an initial amount when internal cancer is
    first diagnosed; a fixed amount for each day an insured is
    hospitalized for cancer treatment; fixed amounts for radiation,
    chemotherapy and surgery; and a wellness benefit applicable
    toward certain diagnostic tests. In August 2007, we introduced
    our newest cancer product, Maximum
    Difference

SM

.
    This new cancer indemnity plan incorporates coverage for medical
    advances in cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment and the many
    new ways cancer patients may now receive their care. Maximum
    Difference allows customization of coverage to fit varying needs
    and budgets.

Our hospital indemnity products provide fixed daily benefits for
    hospitalization due to accident or sickness. In 2005, we
    introduced a new version of our hospital indemnity plan.
    Indemnity benefits for inpatient and outpatient surgeries, as
    well as various other diagnostic expenses, are also available.
    Our sickness indemnity plan provides a fixed daily benefit for
    hospitalization due to sickness and fixed amounts for physician
    services for accident or sickness.

Aflac U.S. offers a specified health event policy that
    gives consumers three benefit and premium levels from which they
    may select. One of the levels combines the specified health
    event policy with

I-4


our intensive care plan. By leveraging administrative
    efficiencies, consumers can purchase the combined coverage for
    less than purchasing the policies separately.

Aflac U.S. offers term and whole life policies sold through
    payroll deduction at the worksite and various term and whole
    life policies on a direct basis. In early 2006, we introduced a
    revised life insurance portfolio called the Life Protector
    Series. This product line offers term policies with varying
    duration options and a new whole life policy with additional
    benefits, including an increased face value option. These
    revisions greatly enhanced the product category and contributed
    to its success in the marketplace.

We also offer a series of fixed-benefit dental policies,
    providing various levels of benefits for dental procedures,
    including checkups and cleanings. Plan features include a
    renewal guarantee, no deductible and no network restrictions.

Aflac U.S. offers Vision
    Now

SM

,
    which provides benefits for serious eye health conditions and
    loss of sight. Vision Now includes coverage for corrective eye
    materials and exam benefits.

We also offer other health insurance products including tax
    qualified and non-qualified long-term care plans. For additional
    information on Aflac’s U.S. products and composition
    of sales, see the Aflac U.S. section of MD&A in this
    report.

Distribution -
    Japan

We sell our products primarily through two distribution
    channels: independent corporate/individual agencies and
    affiliated corporate agencies.

The independent corporate agencies and individual agencies that
    sell our products give us better access to workers at the vast
    number of small businesses in Japan. Agents’ activities are
    primarily focused on insurance sales, with customer service
    support provided by the Aflac Contact Center. Independent
    corporate agencies and individual agencies contributed 56% of
    total new annualized premium sales in 2007, 58% in 2006 and 57%
    in 2005. Affiliated corporate agencies are formed when companies
    establish subsidiary businesses to sell our insurance products
    to their employees, suppliers and customers. These agencies help
    us reach employees at large worksites, including 89% of the
    companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Affiliated
    corporate agencies contributed 36% of total new annualized
    premium sales in 2007, compared with 33% in 2006 and 35% in
    2005. During 2007, we recruited approximately 3,200 new sales
    agencies. As of December 31, 2007, Aflac Japan was
    represented by more than 18,400 sales agencies with more than
    100,800 licensed sales associates. We believe that new agencies
    will continue to be attracted to Aflac Japan’s high
    commissions, superior products, customer service and strong
    brand image.

To improve the overall effectiveness of our sales force, we
    continued to employ New Associates Basic Training, which we
    launched in November 2006. This six-month training curriculum
    combines classroom and field training to improve agents’
    face-to-face consultation skills, with particular emphasis on
    the direct market and small- to medium-sized companies. Our
    training is also continuing to steer affiliated agencies to
    replace passive, or “pull” sales tactics, like direct
    mailings and newspaper ads, with active, or “push”
    techniques that involve more

follow-up

calls and face-to-face sales consultations. By the end of 2007,
    we had trained approximately 3,300 newly recruited sales
    associates through this new training program.

I-5


Aflac Service Shops encourage face-to-face sales techniques
    through convenient locations and knowledgeable sales associates.
    By the end of 2007, we had 604 Aflac Service Shops throughout
    Japan. To continue to enhance the level of service we offer, we
    began an

“e-learning”

system that is combined with a series of internal seminars aimed
    at providing a one-year training program to service shops. In
    addition to individual agencies and independent corporate
    agencies, affiliated corporate agencies have also seen the
    benefits and opened service shops.

We continued to reach consumers through our strategic marketing
    alliance with Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Company (Dai-ichi
    Life). We believe our alliance has been one of the most
    successful partnerships in the insurance industry. In 2007,
    Dai-ichi Life sold approximately 244,000 of our market-leading
    cancer life policies, compared with 269,700 policies in 2006 and
    277,700 policies in 2005, enabling Dai-ichi Life to retain its
    distinction as the number two seller of cancer insurance behind
    only Aflac.

We also spent 2007 preparing for new distribution opportunities,
    including sales through banks. Although we have sold our
    products to employees of banks since our entry into Japan in
    1974, December 2007 marked the first time it was permissible for
    banks to sell third sector insurance products to their
    customers. We have been preparing for this new sales channel
    since 2004 and we believe we are well-positioned in the banking
    sector. By the end of January 2008, we had agreements with 41
    banks to market Aflac’s products through more than 3,300
    branches nationwide.

Another distribution opportunity for Aflac was announced in
    November 2007 when Japan Post Network Co. selected Aflac Japan
    as the provider of cancer insurance to be sold through
    Japan’s vast post office network. Japan Post Network Co.
    operates the 24,000 post offices located throughout Japan,
    providing a significant opportunity for us to reach new
    consumers.

For additional information on Aflac Japan’s distribution,
    see the Aflac Japan section of MD&A in this report.

Distribution -
    U.S.

Our U.S. sales force comprises sales associates who are
    independent contractors licensed to sell accident and health
    insurance. Many are also licensed to sell life insurance. Sales
    associates are paid commissions based on first-year and renewal
    premiums from their sales of insurance products. In addition to
    receiving commissions on personal production, district, regional
    and state sales coordinators may also receive override
    commissions and incentive bonuses. Most associates’ efforts
    are principally focused on selling supplemental insurance at the
    worksite. Administrative personnel in Georgia, New York, and
    Nebraska handle policyholder service functions, including
    issuance of policies, premium collection, payment notices and
    claims.

We concentrate on marketing our products at the worksite. This
    method offers policies to individuals through employment, trade
    and other associations. This manner of marketing is distinct
    from the group insurance sales approach in that our policies are
    individually underwritten and premiums are generally paid by the
    employee. Additionally, Aflac policies are portable, meaning
    that individuals may retain their full insurance coverage upon
    separation from employment or such affiliation, generally at the
    same premium. We collect a major portion of premiums on such
    sales through payroll deduction or other forms of centralized
    billing. Worksite marketing enables a sales

I-6


associate to reach a greater number of prospective policyholders
    and lowers distribution costs, compared with individually
    marketed business.

During the past several years, we have enhanced and increased
    the size of our distribution system. We recruited more than
    24,200 new sales associates in 2007, which resulted in a 4.2%
    increase in licensed agents at the end of the year, compared
    with 2006. However, increasing our sales force means more than
    just recruiting people. Over the last two years, we have shifted
    our focus to growing the number of average weekly producers,
    which measures high-quality, consistent, capable producers who
    make solid, consistent contributions to sales. On a weekly
    basis, the average number of U.S. associates actively
    producing business rose 6.0% to more than 10,900 in 2007.

For new sales associates, we continued to implement the New
    Associate Training Cycle, which combines classroom instruction
    and online learning through

Aflac
    University

®

with field training. The New Associate Training Cycle also
    includes LEASE training (Larger Earnings by Acquiring Smaller
    Employers), which helps new sales associates jumpstart their
    sales careers with an easily transferable guide for approaching
    smaller businesses.

In addition to training sales associates, we extended our
    training of both new and veteran sales force management. Sales
    associates who exhibit leadership potential are invited to
    participate in our national Coordinator in Training (CIT)
    program. The CIT program concentrates on developing potential
    leaders’ skills so they have a better chance to succeed as
    a district sales coordinator, the first level of Aflac’s
    sales force management. For district and regional sales
    coordinators, we refined and expanded the use of coordinator
    accreditation programs. We also began developing an
    accreditation curriculum that will be rolled out in 2008 for
    state sales coordinators, our highest level of sales management.
    Like the accreditation for regional sales coordinators, this new
    program will emphasize the management of managers. We believe
    our efforts to increase the size and capability of our field
    force will translate into a higher proportion of successful
    producing sales associates in the future.

Competition -
    Japan

In 1974, Aflac was granted an operating license to sell life
    insurance in Japan, making Aflac the second non-Japanese life
    insurance company to gain direct access to the Japanese
    insurance market. Through 1981, we faced limited competition for
    cancer life insurance policy sales. However, Japan has
    experienced two periods of deregulation since we entered the
    market. The first came in the early 1980s, when nine mid-sized
    insurers, including domestic and foreign, were allowed to sell
    cancer insurance products for the first time. In 2001, all life
    and non-life insurers were allowed to sell stand-alone cancer
    and medical insurance products as well as other stand-alone
    health insurance products. As a result, the number of insurance
    companies offering stand-alone cancer and medical insurance has
    more than doubled since the market was deregulated in 2001.
    However, based on our growth of annualized premiums in force and
    agencies, we do not believe that our market-leading position has
    been significantly impacted by increased competition.
    Furthermore, we believe the continued development and
    maintenance of operating efficiencies will allow us to offer
    affordable products that appeal to consumers.

I-7


Aflac has had substantial success selling cancer life policies
    in Japan, with 14 million cancer life policies in force as
    of December 31, 2007. We believe we will remain a leading
    provider of cancer life insurance coverage in Japan, principally
    due to our experience in the market, low-cost operations, unique
    marketing system (see Distribution - Japan above) and
    product expertise.

We have also experienced substantial success selling medical
    insurance in Japan. While other companies have recognized the
    opportunities that we have seen in the medical insurance market
    and offered new products, we believe our products stand out as a
    tremendous value to consumers. Aflac Japan continued to be the
    number one seller of stand-alone medical insurance in the life
    insurance industry in terms of policy sales throughout the year.

Competition -
    U.S.

Approximately 1,000 life insurance companies are licensed in the
    United States. We compete against several insurers on a national
    basis plus other insurers regionally. We believe our policies
    and premium rates, as well as the commissions paid to our sales
    associates, are competitive with those offered by other
    companies providing similar types of insurance. However, we
    believe our U.S. business is distinct from our competitors
    because of our product focus, distribution system, and brand
    awareness. For many of the other companies that sell
    supplemental insurance, it represents a secondary business. For
    us, it is our primary business. We also believe that our growing
    distribution system of independent sales associates expands our
    business opportunities, while our advertising campaigns have
    increased our name awareness and consumer understanding of our
    brand message.

Private insurers and voluntary and cooperative plans, such as
    Blue Cross and Blue Shield, provide insurance for
    hospitalization and medical expenses. Much of this insurance is
    sold on a group basis. The federal and state governments also
    pay substantial costs of medical treatment through various
    programs. Such major medical insurance generally covers a
    substantial amount of the medical expenses incurred by an
    insured as a result of accident and disability, cancer or other
    major illnesses. Aflac’s policies are designed to provide
    coverage that supplements major medical insurance and may also
    be used to defray nonmedical expenses. Thus, we do not compete
    directly with major medical insurers. However, the scope of
    major medical coverage offered by other insurers does represent
    a potential limitation on the market for our products.
    Accordingly, expansion of coverage by other insurers or
    governmental programs could adversely affect our business
    opportunities. Conversely, any reduction of coverage, or
    increased deductibles and copayments, by other insurers or
    governmental programs could favorably affect our business
    opportunities.

Investments and
    Investment Results

Net investment income was $2.3 billion in 2007,
    $2.2 billion in 2006 and $2.1 billion in 2005. Growth
    of net investment income during the last three years has been
    impacted by the low level of investment yields for new money in
    both Japan and the United States. In particular, Japan’s
    life insurance industry has contended with low investment yields
    for a number of years. Although the Bank of Japan ended its
    zero-interest-rate policy in 2006, market yields on
    long-duration fixed maturity securities which we primarily
    purchase in Japan did not increase measurably during the year.

Regulation -
    Japan

The financial and business affairs of Aflac Japan are subject to
    examination by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA).
    Aflac Japan files annual reports and financial statements for
    the Japanese insurance operations based on a March 31 fiscal
    year end, prepared in accordance with Japanese regulatory
    accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the FSA.
    Japanese regulatory basis earnings are determined using
    accounting principles that differ materially from
    U.S. GAAP. Under Japanese regulatory accounting practices,
    policy acquisition costs are charged off immediately; deferred
    income tax liabilities are recognized on a different basis;
    policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are
    different; the carrying value of securities transferred to
    held-to-maturity is different; policyholder protection
    corporation obligations are not accrued; and premium income is
    recognized on a cash basis. Reconciliations of the net assets of
    the Japan

The FSA maintains a solvency standard, which is used by Japanese
    regulators to monitor the financial strength of insurance
    companies. Aflac Japan’s solvency margin continues to
    significantly exceed regulatory minimums. A portion of Aflac
    Japan’s annual earnings, as determined on a Japanese
    regulatory accounting basis, may be repatriated each year to
    Aflac U.S. after complying with solvency margin provisions
    and satisfying various conditions imposed by Japan’s
    regulatory authorities for protecting policyholders. These
    repatriated profits represent a portion of Aflac Japan’s
    after-tax earnings reported to the FSA on a March 31 fiscal year
    basis. If needed, we may elect not to repatriate profits to
    Aflac U.S. or to repatriate a reduced amount to strengthen
    Aflac Japan’s solvency margin. In addition, the FSA may not
    allow profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to Aflac
    U.S. if they would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient
    financial strength for the protection of Japanese policyholders.
    We do not expect these requirements to adversely affect the
    funds available for profit repatriations. Nor do we expect these
    requirements to adversely affect the funds available for
    payments of allocated expenses to Aflac U.S. and management
    fees to the Parent Company.

At the end of 2006, Aflac Japan, along with the entire life
    insurance industry, began a review of the last five years of
    paid claims to determine if those claims were paid fully and
    accurately. In April 2007, Aflac Japan reported the findings of
    its review to the FSA. In October 2007, the insurance industry
    updated its data for underpaid claims. The updated data for the
    industry included an increase in the number of cases and yen
    amount of underpayment compared to the data that was first
    reported in April, primarily a result of a type of underpayment
    where companies did not notify policyholders of their potential
    eligibility for additional benefit payments which the
    policyholders did not claim in their original filings. Our
    initial estimate for that type of underpayment was fairly
    accurate and the number of cases was very small. In the fourth
    quarter we reported 26,700 cases of delayed interest payments on
    cash surrender values, which on average was 75 yen per case
    (approximately $.66 per case using the December 31, 2007,
    period-end exchange rate). In total for the five-year period, we
    reported 1.9 billion yen (approximately $16.8 million
    using the December 31, 2007, exchange rate) of underpaid
    claims in April, and we revised the amount to 2.1 billion
    yen (approximately $18.4 million using the
    December 31, 2007 exchange rate) in October. We are using
    this review to identify process changes that will help ensure
    that payment errors such as these are not repeated. The
    financial impact of paying the claims that were in error was
    immaterial to our operations and has been provided for in our
    2007 and 2006 financial statements as applicable.

I-13


The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection
    corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of
    insolvent insurers. For additional information regarding the
    policyholder protection fund, see the Policyholder Protection
    Corporation section of MD&A and Note 2 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

In October 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing Japan’s
    postal system (Japan Post) was enacted into law. The
    privatization laws split Japan Post into four entities that
    began operating in October 2007. The four entities are Japan
    Post Service Co., Ltd.; Japan Post Network Co., Ltd.; Japan Post
    Bank Co., Ltd.; and Japan Post Insurance Co., Ltd. The entire
    privatization process is scheduled to be completed by October
    2017. In addition to the normal FSA approval process, the law
    requires that new product offerings by the Japan Post financial
    entities must undergo a special review by Japan’s Postal
    Privatization Committee and approval by Japan’s Prime
    Minister and the Minister for Internal Affairs and
    Communications. In November 2007, Japan Post Network Co.
    selected Aflac Japan as its provider of cancer insurance and
    coordinator of administrative support for third sector products.
    Japan Post Network Co. operates the 24,000 post offices located
    throughout Japan. Japan Post has not yet established a specific
    time frame for sales to commence. Being selected as the
    administrative support coordinator for third sector products
    means that Aflac will work with Japan Post Network Co. on
    creating new infrastructure for not only Aflac’s
    product(s), but all third sector products, including such
    functions as administrative workflow, IT systems, and logistics
    for delivering sales materials. The infrastructure will deal
    with a wide range of issues such as acceptance of policy
    application and maintenance forms, payment of premiums, and
    providing Japan Post Network Co. with data on performance of
    every post office and employee, including new policies sold and
    policies in force.

Our branch in Japan is also subject to regulation and
    supervision in the United States (see Regulation - U.S.).
    For additional information regarding Aflac Japan’s
    operations and regulations, see the Aflac Japan section of
    MD&A and Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Regulation -
    U.S.

The Parent Company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to
    state regulations in the United States as an insurance holding
    company system. Such regulations generally provide that
    transactions between companies within the holding company system
    must be fair and equitable. In addition, transfers of assets
    among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from
    insurance subsidiaries, and material transactions between
    companies within the system are subject to prior notice to, or
    approval by, state regulatory authorities.

Like all U.S. insurance companies, Aflac is subject to
    regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do
    business. In general, the insurance laws of the various
    jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad
    administrative powers relating to, among other things:

•

granting and revoking licenses to transact business

•

regulating trade practices

•

licensing of agents

•

approval of policy forms and premium rates

•

standards of solvency and maintenance of specified policy
    benefit reserves and minimum loss ratio requirements

•

capital requirements

I-14


•

limitations on dividends to shareholders

•

the nature of and limitations on investments

•

deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders

•

filing of financial statements prepared in accordance with
    statutory insurance accounting practices prescribed or permitted
    by regulatory authorities

•

periodic examinations of the market conduct, financial, and
    other affairs of insurance companies

Additionally, the National Association of Insurance
    Commissioners (NAIC) continually reviews regulatory matters and
    recommends changes and revisions for adoption by state
    legislators and insurance departments.

The NAIC uses a risk-based capital formula relating to insurance
    risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk to
    facilitate identification by insurance regulators of
    inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the
    types and mix of risk inherent in the insurer’s operations.
    The formulas for determining the amount of risk-based capital
    specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial
    balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived
    degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio
    of a company’s regulatory total adjusted capital to its
    authorized control level risk-based capital as defined by the
    NAIC. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are
    classified within certain levels, each of which requires
    specified corrective action. The levels are company action,
    regulatory action, authorized control, and mandatory control.
    Aflac’s NAIC risk-based capital ratio remains high and
    reflects a very strong capital and surplus position.

For further information concerning Aflac U.S. operations,
    regulation and dividend restrictions, see the Aflac
    U.S. section of MD&A and Notes 2 and 11 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, Aflac Japan had
    3,704 employees and Aflac U.S. had 4,344 employees. We
    consider our employee relations to be excellent.

Other
    Operations

Our other operations include the Parent Company and a printing
    subsidiary. These operations had 310 employees as of
    December 31, 2007. We consider our relations with these
    employees to be excellent. For additional information on our
    other operations, see the Other Operations section of MD&A.

ITEM 1A. RISK
    FACTORS.

Risk
    Factors

We face a wide range of risks, and our continued success depends
    on our ability to identify, prioritize and appropriately manage
    our enterprise risk exposures. Readers should carefully consider
    each of the following risks and all of the other information set
    forth in this

Form 10-K.

These risks and other factors may affect forward-looking
    statements, including those in this document or made by the
    Company elsewhere, such as in earnings release webcasts,
    investor conference presentations or press releases. The risks
    and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones
    facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known to us or that we currently believe to be
    immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the
    following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events,
    there could be a material impact on the Company.

We operate in an
    industry that is subject to ongoing changes.

We operate in a competitive environment and in an industry that
    is subject to ongoing changes from market pressures brought
    about by customer demands, legislative reform, marketing
    practices and changes to health care and health insurance
    delivery. These factors require us to anticipate market trends
    and make changes to differentiate our products and services from
    those of our competitors. We also face the potential of
    competition from existing or new companies that have not
    historically been in the supplemental health insurance industry.
    Failure to anticipate market trends

and/or

to
    differentiate our products and services can affect our ability
    to retain or grow profitable lines of business.

Our concentration
    of business in Japan poses risks to our operations.

Our operations in Japan accounted for 71%, 72%, and 74% of our
    total revenues for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, and 82%
    of our total assets at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. As
    a result, weakness in Japan’s economy could adversely
    affect our business. The weak economy in Japan that emerged in
    the early 1990s resulted in a challenging marketing environment
    for Aflac Japan, with declining available investment yields for
    new investments and decreased consumer confidence. Although the
    Japanese economy has been growing in recent years, the ability
    to sustain such expansion remains uncertain.

Japanese currency
    translation risk could materially impact reported operating
    results.

Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is
    the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate
    can have a significant effect on our reported financial position
    and results of operations. In periods when the yen weakens,
    translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be
    reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars
    causes more dollars to be reported.

Aflac Japan’s premiums and most of its investment income
    are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we
    primarily purchase yen-denominated assets to support
    yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other
    yen-denominated financial statement items are translated into
    dollars for financial reporting purposes. However, it is
    important to distinguish between translating and converting
    foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions,
    we do not

I-16


actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign
    currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac
    and not an economic event to our Company or shareholders.

General market
    conditions affect investments and investment income.

We have substantial investment portfolios that support our
    policy liabilities. Low levels of interest rates on investments,
    such as those experienced in the United States and Japan during
    recent years, have negatively impacted the level of investment
    income earned by the Company. Slower investment income growth
    will occur if a low-interest-rate environment persists.

Financial market conditions can also affect our realized and
    unrealized investment gains or losses. During periods of rising
    interest rates, the fair values of our investments will decline.
    Conversely, during periods of falling interest rates, the fair
    values of our investments will rise. However, should significant
    amounts of unrealized gains/losses occur because of changes in
    market yields, we would not expect to realize significant gains
    or losses due to our ability and intent to hold the securities
    to maturity or recovery of value.

Availability of
    acceptable yen-denominated investments could adversely affect
    our profits.

We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration
    of our liabilities. At December 31, 2007, the average
    duration of Aflac Japan’s policy liabilities was
    approximately 14 years and the average duration of its
    yen-denominated debt securities was approximately 13 years.
    When our debt securities mature, there is a risk that the
    proceeds will be reinvested at a yield below that of the
    interest required for the accretion of policy liabilities. If
    this occurs, Aflac Japan’s business would be adversely
    affected.

Concentration of
    our investment portfolios in any particular sector of the
    economy may have an adverse effect on our financial position or
    results of operations.

The concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular
    industry, group of related industries or geographic sector could
    have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and,
    consequently, on our results of operations and financial
    position. Events or developments that have a negative impact on
    any particular industry, group of related industries or
    geographic sector may have a greater adverse effect on the
    investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are
    concentrated rather than diversified.

If future policy
    benefits, claims or expenses exceed those anticipated in
    establishing premiums and reserves, our financial results would
    be adversely affected.

We establish and carry, as a liability, reserves based on
    estimates of how much will be required to pay for future
    benefits and claims. We calculate these reserves using various
    assumptions and estimates, including premiums we will receive
    over the assumed life of the policy; the timing, frequency and
    severity of the events covered by the insurance policy; and the
    investment returns on the assets we purchase with a portion of
    our net cash flow from operations. These assumptions and
    estimates are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot
    determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay
    for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits and claims or
    whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow
    to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims.
    If our actual experience is different from our assumptions or
    estimates, our reserves may prove inadequate. As a result, we
    would incur a charge to earnings in the period in which we
    determine such a shortfall exists. This estimation process is a
    critical accounting policy for the Company.

I-17


Our operating
    subsidiaries provide cash flow to the Parent Company.

Aflac Incorporated is a holding company and has no direct
    operations or no significant assets other than the stock of its
    subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our
    operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for
    dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to
    meet our financial obligations. There is no assurance that the
    earnings from, or other available assets of, our operating
    subsidiaries will be sufficient to make distributions to us to
    enable us to operate.

Extensive
    regulation can impact profitability and growth.

Aflac’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex laws
    and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number
    of governmental authorities, including state insurance
    regulators, the SEC, the NAIC, the FSA, the Ministry of Finance
    (MOF) in Japan, the U.S. Department of Justice, state
    attorneys general, and the Internal Revenue Service, each of
    which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently,
    we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular
    regulator’s or enforcement authority’s interpretation
    of a legal or regulatory issue may not result in compliance with
    another regulator’s or enforcement authority’s
    interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance
    is judged in hindsight. There is also a risk that any particular
    regulator’s or enforcement authority’s interpretation
    of a legal or regulatory issue may change over time to our
    detriment. In addition, changes in the overall legal or
    regulatory environment may, even absent any particular
    regulator’s or enforcement authority’s interpretation
    of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the
    actions we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk
    management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our
    practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow or
    otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business.

The primary purpose of insurance company regulation supervision
    is the protection of insurance policyholders, rather than
    investors. The extent of regulation varies, but generally is
    governed by state statutes in the United States and by the FSA
    and the MOF in Japan. These systems of supervision and
    regulation cover, among other things:

•

standards of establishing and setting premium rates and the
    approval thereof

•

standards of minimum capital requirements and solvency margins,
    including risk-based capital measures

•

restrictions on, limitations on and required approval of certain
    transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their
    affiliates, including management fee arrangements

•

restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of
    investments

•

restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can
    include in the insurance policies offered by our primary
    insurance operations

•

limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance
    subsidiaries can pay or foreign profits that can be repatriated

•

the existence and licensing status of the Company under
    circumstances where it is not writing new or renewal business

•

certain required methods of accounting

•

reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes

I-18


•

assignment of residual market business and potential assessments
    for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of
    covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired,
    insolvent or failed insurance companies

•

administrative practices requirements

•

imposition of fines and other sanctions

Sales of our
    products and services are dependent on our ability to attract,
    retain and support a network of qualified sales
    associates.

Our sales could be adversely affected if our sales networks
    deteriorate or if we do not adequately provide support, training
    and education for our existing network. Competition exists for
    sales associates with demonstrated ability. We compete with
    other insurers and financial institutions primarily on the basis
    of our products, compensation, support services and financial
    rating. An inability to attract and retain qualified sales
    associates could have a material adverse effect on sales and our
    results of operations and financial condition. Our sales
    associates are independent contractors and may sell products of
    our competitors. If our competitors offer products that are more
    attractive than ours, or pay higher commissions than we do,
    these sales associates may concentrate their efforts on selling
    our competitors’ products instead of ours.

Success of our
    business depends in part on effective information technology
    systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements
    in technology; certain significant multiyear strategic
    information technology projects are currently in
    process.

Our business depends in large part on our technology systems for
    interacting with employers, policyholders and sales associates,
    and our business strategy involves providing customers with
    easy-to-use products to meet their needs. Some of our
    information technology systems and software are older,
    legacy-type systems that are less efficient and require an
    ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or
    upgrade to current standards (including adequate business
    continuity procedures). While we are in a continual state of
    upgrading and enhancing Aflac business systems, changes are
    always challenging in a complex integrated environment. Aflac
    uses proven techniques, controls and standards to minimize the
    risk associated with a changing technical environment. We are
    currently developing new systems to keep pace with continuing
    changes in information processing technology, evolving industry
    and regulatory standards, and customer demands. Our success is
    dependent in large part on maintaining or improving the
    effectiveness of existing systems and continuing to develop and
    enhance information systems that support our business processes
    in a cost-efficient manner.

Changes in
    accounting standards issued by the FASB or other
    standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial
    statements.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of
    generally accepted accounting principles in both the United
    States and Japan, which are periodically revised

and/or

expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised
    accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies,
    including the FASB. It is possible that future accounting
    standards we are required to adopt could change the current
    accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial
    statements and that such changes could have a material adverse
    effect on our results and financial condition.

I-19


Any decrease in
    our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our
    competitive position.

Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing
    the competitive position of insurance companies and generally
    have an effect on an insurance company’s business. On an
    ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance
    and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the
    outlook on an insurer’s ratings due to, for example, a
    change in an insurer’s statutory capital; a change in a
    rating agency’s determination of the amount of
    risk-adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating;
    an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer’s
    investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in management; or
    other considerations that may or may not be under the
    insurer’s control. Because all of our ratings are subject
    to continual review, the retention of these ratings cannot be
    assured. A multilevel downgrade in any of these ratings could
    have a material adverse effect on agent recruiting and
    retention, sales, competitiveness, and the marketability of our
    products impacting our liquidity, operating results and
    financial condition.

We face risks
    related to litigation.

We are a defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the
    normal course of business. Members of our senior legal and
    financial management teams review litigation on a quarterly and
    annual basis. The final results of any litigation cannot be
    predicted with certainty. Although some of this litigation is
    pending in states where large punitive damages, bearing little
    relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs, have
    been awarded in recent years, we believe the outcome of pending
    litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
    However, litigation could adversely affect us because of the
    costs of defending these cases, costs of settlement or judgments
    against us or because of changes in our operations that could
    result from litigation.

Managing key
    executive succession is critical to our success.

We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for
    succession of our senior management and other key executives.
    While we have succession plans and employment arrangements with
    certain key executives, these do not guarantee that the services
    of these executives will be available to us.

We also face
    other risks that could adversely affect our business, results of
    operations or financial condition, which include:

•

any requirement to restate financial results in the event of
    inappropriate application of accounting principles

•

any event that could damage our reputation

•

failure of our processes to prevent and detect unethical conduct
    of employees

•

a significant failure of internal controls over financial
    reporting

•

failure of our prevention and control systems related to
    employee compliance with internal policies and regulatory
    requirements

•

failure of corporate governance policies and procedures

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

Aflac owns land and buildings that comprise two primary campuses
    located in Columbus, Georgia. These campuses include buildings
    that serve as our worldwide headquarters and house
    administrative support functions for our U.S. operations.
    Aflac also leases administrative office space in Georgia, New
    York, and Nebraska. In 2005, we announced a multiyear building
    project for additional office space in Columbus, Georgia. The
    initial phase was completed in 2007 and provides additional
    space for administrative support functions. The next phase of
    the expansion, to be completed in 2009, will house our
    Information Technology group.

In Tokyo, Japan, Aflac has two primary campuses. The first
    campus includes a building, owned by Aflac, for the customer
    call center, Information Technology departments, and training
    facility. It also includes a leased property, which houses our
    policy administration and customer service departments. The
    second campus comprises leased space, which serves as our Japan
    branch headquarters and houses administrative support functions
    for the Japan branch. Aflac also leases additional office space
    in Tokyo, along with regional offices located throughout the
    country.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    INFORMATION

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a
    “safe harbor” to encourage companies to provide
    prospective information, so long as those informational
    statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied
    by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important
    factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
    from those included in the forward-looking statements. We desire
    to take advantage of these provisions. This report contains
    cautionary statements identifying important factors that could
    cause actual results to differ materially from those projected
    herein, and in any other statements made by Company officials in
    communications with the financial community and contained in
    documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (SEC). Forward-looking statements are not based on historical
    information and relate to future operations, strategies,

COMPANY
    OVERVIEW

Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries
    (collectively, the Company) primarily sell supplemental health
    and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The
    Company’s insurance business is marketed and administered
    through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus
    (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as
    a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflac’s policies
    are individually underwritten and marketed through independent
    agents. Our insurance operations in the United States and our
    branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance
    business.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to inform the
    reader about matters affecting the financial condition and
    results of operations of Aflac Incorporated and its subsidiaries
    for the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. As a
    result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction
    with the related consolidated financial statements and notes.

This MD&A is divided into four primary sections. In the
    first section, we discuss our critical accounting estimates. We
    then follow with a discussion of the results of our operations
    on a consolidated basis and by segment. The third section
    presents an analysis of our financial condition as well as a
    discussion of market risks of financial instruments. We conclude
    by addressing the availability of capital and the sources and
    uses of cash in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The
    preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires us to make estimates based on currently available
    information when recording transactions resulting from business
    operations. The estimates that we deem to be most critical to an
    understanding of Aflac’s results of operations and
    financial condition are those related to investments, deferred
    policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities. The preparation
    and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve
    the use of various assumptions developed from management’s
    analyses and judgments. The application of these critical
    accounting estimates determines the values at which 94% of our
    assets and 84% of our liabilities are reported and thus have a
    direct effect on net earnings and shareholders’ equity.
    Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce
    significantly different results.

Investments

Aflac’s investments in debt and equity securities include
    both publicly issued and privately issued securities. For
    privately issued securities, we receive pricing data from
    external sources that take into account each security’s
    credit quality and liquidity characteristics. We also routinely
    review our investments that have experienced declines in fair
    value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. These
    reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and
    circumstances of an issuer in accordance with SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 59, Accounting for Non-Current
    Marketable Equity Securities; Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities; Financial Accounting

The
    Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application
    to Certain Investments and related guidance. The identification

II-7


the determination of fair value if not publicly traded, and the
    assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve
    significant management judgment and require evaluation of
    factors, including but not limited to:

•

percentage decline in value and the length of time during which
    the decline has occurred

•

recoverability of principal and interest

•

market conditions

•

ability to hold the investment to maturity

•

review of the issuer’s overall operating performance

•

rating agency opinions and actions regarding the issuer’s
    credit standing

•

adverse changes in the issuer’s availability of production
    resources, revenue sources and technological conditions

•

adverse changes in the issuer’s economic, regulatory or
    political environment

Deferred Policy
    Acquisition Costs and Policy Liabilities

Aflac’s products are generally long-duration fixed-benefit
    indemnity contracts. As such, those products are accounted for
    under the requirements of SFAS No. 60, Accounting and
    Reporting by Insurance Enterprises. We make estimates of certain
    factors that affect the profitability of our business to match
    expected policy benefits and deferrable acquisition costs with
    expected policy premiums. These assumptions include persistency,
    morbidity, mortality, investment yields and expenses. If actual
    results match the assumptions used in establishing policy
    liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition
    costs, profits will emerge as a level percentage of earned
    premiums. However, because actual results will vary from the
    assumptions, profits as a percentage of earned premiums will
    vary from year to year.

We measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and
    recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC)
    annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business.
    Our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are
    adequate and that our DAC is recoverable.

Deferred Policy
    Acquisition Costs

Under the requirements of SFAS No. 60, certain costs
    of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the
    policy’s premium payment period in proportion to
    anticipated premium income. Future amortization of DAC is based
    upon our estimates of persistency, interest and future premium
    revenue generally established at the time of policy issuance.
    However, the unamortized balance of DAC reflects actual
    persistency. As presented in the following table, the ratio of
    unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has been
    relatively stable for Aflac U.S. over the last three years.
    The ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has
    shown a slight upward trend for Aflac Japan for the last three
    years. This trend is a result of a greater proportion of our
    annualized premiums being under the alternative commission
    schedule, which pays a higher commission on first-year premiums
    and lower commissions on renewal premiums. This schedule is very
    popular with our new agents as it helps them with cash flow for
    personal and business needs as they build their business. While
    this has resulted in a higher unamortized DAC balance, the
    overall cost to the company has been reduced.

Our policy liabilities, which are determined in accordance with
    SFAS No. 60 and Actuarial Standards of Practice,
    include two primary components: future policy benefits and
    unpaid policy claims, which accounted for 90% and 5% of total
    policy liabilities as of December 31, 2007, respectively.

Future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the
    future and are generally calculated as the present value of
    future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value
    of future expected net benefit premiums. We calculate future
    policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality,
    persistency and interest. These assumptions are generally
    established at the time a policy is issued. The assumptions used
    in the calculations are closely related to those used in
    developing

II-9


the gross premiums for a policy. As required by GAAP, we also
    include a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to
    accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience.

Unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been
    incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an
    estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not
    yet been reported to us. We compute unpaid policy claims on a
    non-discounted basis using statistical analyses of historical
    claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed
    conditions. We update the assumptions underlying the estimate of
    unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporate our historical
    experience as well as other data that provides information
    regarding our outstanding liability.

Our insurance products provide fixed-benefit amounts per
    occurrence that are not subject to medical-cost inflation.
    Furthermore, our business is widely dispersed in both the United
    States and Japan. This geographic dispersion and the nature of
    our benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant
    unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and
    events of a catastrophic nature. Claims incurred under
    Aflac’s policies are generally reported and paid in a
    relatively short time frame. The unpaid claims liability is
    sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and
    frequency of claims. Severity is the ultimate size of a claim,
    and frequency is the number of claims incurred. Our claims
    experience is primarily related to the demographics of our
    policyholders.

As a part of our established financial reporting and accounting
    practices and controls, we perform actuarial reviews of our
    policyholder liabilities on an ongoing basis and reflect the
    results of those reviews in our results of operations and
    financial condition as required by GAAP.

Our fourth quarter 2007 review indicated that we needed to
    strengthen the liability for two closed blocks of business,
    primarily due to better-than-expected persistency. In Japan, we
    strengthened our future policy benefits liability by
    $18 million for a closed block of dementia policies. In the
    United States, we strengthened our future policy benefits
    liability by $8 million for a closed block of
    small-face-amount life insurance coverage.

Our 2006 analysis of recent cancer claims experience indicated
    that the overall duration of cancer outpatient treatments had
    lengthened. Because our reserving methods are designed to fully
    accrue each cancer outpatient treatment as of the date of
    initial treatment, we increased our estimate of the Aflac
    U.S. unpaid policy claims liability by $28 million in
    December 2006. This change in estimate was reflected in 2006
    earnings. If we had been using the new claims factors to produce
    our claim liability estimates at the end of 2005, the increase
    for 2006 would have been $9 million.

In 2006, our review also indicated that our policyholder
    liabilities were fairly stated in the aggregate; however, the
    components of policyholder liabilities (the unpaid policy claims
    liability and the future policy benefits liability) needed to be
    refined. As a result of our review, we took the actions
    described below.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, we transferred
    $170 million of the Aflac U.S. unpaid policy claims
    liability to the future policy benefits liability for our
    accident/disability, short-term disability, dental and specified
    health event lines of business.

For the accident/disability line of business, a very small
    portion of the benefits in one of our policy forms required a
    future policy benefits liability to be accumulated. This amount
    was insignificant to our financial position in any year.
    However, to provide for this obligation, we approximated this
    liability

II-10


amount as part of the unpaid policy claims liability. We
    determined that it was appropriate to modify our calculation
    method to determine the future policy benefits liability for
    that benefit separately from our unpaid policy claims liability
    and to move this liability of $25 million into the future
    policy benefits liability.

For one of our short-term disability policy forms, we determined
    that a selection factor assumption that should have applied to
    the future claim costs was not reflected in the calculation of
    the future policy benefits liability. We began using the
    calculation including the selection factor in the fourth quarter
    of 2006. We use a total liability approach to determine the
    unpaid policy claims liability for that line of business. For
    this reason, the underestimated amount of the future policy
    benefits liability, approximately $50 million, was
    accounted for in prior periods in the unpaid policy claims
    liability. As a result, we transferred $50 million from the
    unpaid policy claims liability into the future policy benefits
    liability for that line of business.

For our dental and specified health event product lines, both of
    which are recently introduced product lines with limited actual
    claims experience, we refined the reserving methodology. For
    this reason, we had determined our policy liabilities for these
    two product lines using a total liability approach. This
    approach utilized expectations of claims costs and impact of
    underwriting based largely on the product pricing assumptions.
    As we developed experience on the dental and specified health
    event product lines, we modified our assumptions as to the
    impact of underwriting selection. Our experience has shown that
    the underwriting selection impact is greater than we had
    anticipated in our original pricing. In addition, for our dental
    plan, we also modified our assumption of the impact of various
    benefit waiting periods for that plan to reflect the
    larger-than-anticipated impact of the waiting periods. Both of
    these changes in assumptions resulted in 2006 claims being lower
    than anticipated in the original pricing assumptions for these
    two products. Thus, our unpaid claims liability was lower than
    we originally estimated. However, our analysis also showed that
    the future claim cost curve would be steeper than we originally
    anticipated. Thus, we expected more future claims than we
    previously estimated and increased our liability for future
    policy benefits accordingly. For this reason, in the fourth
    quarter of 2006, we modified our methodology to use a
    combination of claim cost expectations and claim completion
    factors to calculate the unpaid policy claims liability for
    these two product lines. As a result, the modification in
    methodology resulted in a transfer from the unpaid policy claims
    liability of approximately $95 million to the future policy
    benefits liability.

Also during the fourth quarter of 2006, we transferred
    $85 million from Aflac Japan’s unpaid policy claims
    liability to its future policy benefits liability. This transfer
    primarily related to a continued decline in current period
    claims caused by changes to health care delivery in Japan and
    had no effect on net earnings. Our 2006 claims review indicated
    that we have experienced a continued decline in the average
    number of in-hospital days associated with cancer treatment
    periods in Japan. We believe the average number of days per
    hospital visit declined primarily due to changes in financial
    incentives provided to hospitals by the government-sponsored
    health care system in Japan to shorten the average hospital
    stay. However, our claims statistics also indicated that the
    declines in the average number of days per hospitalization have
    generally been offset by an increase in the frequency of future
    hospitalizations associated with the treatment of cancer. As a
    result, we reflected the increased number of future
    hospitalizations per claimant in our future policy benefit
    liability. More hospitalizations per claimant will result in a
    larger amount of expected future claims and an increase in our
    liability for future policy benefits. Meanwhile, we are paying
    less for current period claims, and therefore have a smaller
    unpaid claims liability.

II-11


In computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, we consider
    many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under
    the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed
    to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred
    date assignment and current claim administrative practices. We
    monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the
    liability as actual experience emerges. Claim levels are
    generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in
    claim levels may occur. In calculating the unpaid policy claim
    liability, we do not calculate a range of estimates. The
    following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid
    policy claims liability as of December 31, 2007, to changes
    in severity and frequency of claims. For the years 2005 through
    2007, and before the effect of the fourth quarter 2006
    adjustments noted above, our assumptions changed on average by
    approximately 1% in total, and we believe that a variation in
    assumptions in a range of plus or minus 1% in total is
    reasonably likely to occur.

The growth of the future policy benefits liability is the result
    of the aging of our in-force block of business and the addition
    of new business. In addition, the growth in 2006 was moderately
    impacted by the previously discussed transfer of
    $170 million at Aflac U.S. and $85 million at
    Aflac Japan from the unpaid policy claims liability to the
    future policy benefits liability. These two transfers accounted
    for less than 1% of the increase in the aggregate. The table
    below reflects the growth of future policy benefits liability

Realized
    Investment Gains and Losses

Our investment strategy is to invest in investment-grade
    fixed-income securities to provide a reliable stream of
    investment income, which is one of the drivers of the
    Company’s profitability. We do not purchase securities with
    the intent of generating capital gains or losses. However,
    investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of
    changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of
    specific issuers, tax planning strategies,

and/or

general portfolio maintenance and rebalancing. The realization
    of investment gains and losses is independent of the
    underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which
    are the principal drivers of our profitability.

In 2007, we realized pretax gains of $28 million
    (after-tax, $19 million, or $.04 per diluted share)
    primarily as a result of securities sold or redeemed in the
    normal course of business. In 2006, we realized pretax gains of
    $79 million (after-tax, $51 million, or $.10 per
    diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps and the
    liquidation of equity securities held by Aflac U.S. In
    2005, we realized pretax gains of $262 million (after-tax,
    $167 million, or $.33 per diluted share) primarily as a
    result of bond swaps. We began our bond-swap program in the
    second half of 2005 and concluded it in the first half of 2006.
    These bond swaps took advantage of tax loss carryforwards and
    also resulted in an improvement in overall portfolio credit
    quality and investment income.

Impact from
    SFAS 133

We entered into cross-currency swap agreements to effectively
    convert our dollar-denominated senior notes, which mature in
    2009, into a yen-denominated obligation (see Notes 4 and 7
    of the

II-13


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The effect of
    issuing fixed-rate, dollar-denominated debt and swapping it into
    fixed-rate, yen-denominated debt has the same economic impact on
    Aflac as if we had issued yen-denominated debt of a like amount.
    However, the accounting treatment for cross-currency swaps is
    different from issuing yen-denominated Samurai and Uridashi
    notes. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133),
    requires that the change in the fair value of the interest rate
    component of the cross-currency swaps, which does not qualify
    for hedge accounting, be reflected in net earnings. This change
    in fair value is determined by relative dollar and yen interest
    rates and has no cash impact on our results of operations. At
    maturity, the fair value will equal initial contract fair value,
    and the cumulative impact of gains and losses from the changes
    in fair value of the interest component will be zero. We have
    the ability and intent to retain the cross-currency swaps until
    their maturity. The impact from SFAS 133 includes the
    change in fair value of the interest rate component of the
    cross-currency swaps, which does not qualify for hedge
    accounting, and is included in other income.

We have also issued yen-denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes.
    We have designated these notes as a hedge of our investment in
    Aflac Japan. If the value of these yen-denominated notes and the
    notional amounts of the cross-currency swaps exceed our
    investment in Aflac Japan, we would be required to recognize the
    foreign currency effect on the excess, or ineffective portion,
    in net earnings. The ineffective portion would be included in
    the impact from SFAS 133. These hedges were effective
    during the three-year period ended December 31, 2007;
    therefore, there was no impact on net earnings.

We have entered into interest rate swap agreements related to
    the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes
    and have designated the swap agreements as a hedge of the
    variability of the debt cash flows. The notional amounts and
    terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the
    variable interest rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no
    value at inception. SFAS 133 requires that the change in
    the fair value of the swap contracts be recorded in other
    comprehensive income so long as the hedge is deemed effective.
    Any ineffectiveness would be recognized in net earnings (other
    income) and would be included in the impact from SFAS 133.
    These hedges were effective during the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006; therefore, there was no impact
    on net earnings. See Notes 1, 4 and 7 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Nonrecurring
    Items

We received regulatory approval for a change in the allocation
    of expenses under the management fee agreement between Aflac and
    the Parent Company in 2005. This enabled the Parent Company to
    fully utilize its tax-basis, non-life operating losses and
    therefore release the valuation allowance on the associated
    deferred tax assets, resulting in a benefit of $34 million
    ($.07 per diluted share) in 2005. The tax benefit was included
    as a reduction to income tax expense in the 2005 consolidated
    statements of earnings.

Foreign Currency
    Translation

Aflac Japan’s premiums and most of its investment income
    are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we
    primarily purchase yen-denominated assets to support
    yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other
    yen-denominated financial statement items are translated into
    dollars for financial reporting purposes. We translate Aflac
    Japan’s yen-denominated

II-14


income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for
    the reporting period, and we translate its yen-denominated
    balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period.
    However, it is important to distinguish between translating and
    converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of
    transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars.

Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is
    the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate
    can have a significant effect on our reported results. In
    periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars
    results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen
    strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more
    dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the
    effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the
    prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying
    current year results in relation to the prior year. As a result,
    we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting
    issue for Aflac and not an economic event to our Company or
    shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the
    growth rates of our operations, management evaluates
    Aflac’s financial performance, excluding the impact of
    foreign currency translation.

Income
    Taxes

Our combined U.S. and Japanese effective income tax rate on
    pretax earnings was 34.6% in 2007, 34.5% in 2006, and 33.4% in
    2005. Total income taxes were $865 million in 2007,
    compared with $781 million in 2006 and $743 million in
    2005. Japanese income taxes on Aflac Japan’s results
    account for most of our consolidated income tax expense. Our
    2005 income tax rate was lower than normal primarily as a result
    of the release of the valuation allowance for non-life losses
    discussed previously. See Note 8 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Earnings
    Guidance

We communicate earnings guidance in this report based on the
    growth in net earnings per diluted share. However, certain items
    that cannot be predicted or that are outside of
    management’s control may have a significant impact on
    actual results. Therefore, our comparison of net earnings
    includes certain assumptions to reflect the limitations that are
    inherent in projections of net earnings. In comparing
    year-over-year results, we exclude the effect of realized
    investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133 and
    nonrecurring items. We also assume no impact from foreign
    currency translation on the Aflac Japan segment and the Parent
    Company’s yen-denominated interest expense for a given year
    in relation to the prior year.

Subject to the preceding assumptions, our objective for 2007 was
    to increase net earnings per diluted share by 15% to 16% over
    2006. We reported 2007 net earnings per diluted share of
    $3.31. Adjusting that number for realized investment gains ($.04
    per diluted share), the impact from SFAS 133 (nil per
    diluted share) and foreign currency translation (a loss of $.02
    per diluted share), we met our objective for the year.

Our objective for 2008 is to increase net earnings per diluted
    share by 13% to 15% over 2007, on the basis described above. If
    we achieve this objective, the following table shows the likely
    results for 2008 net earnings per diluted share, including
    the impact of foreign currency translation using various
    yen/dollar exchange rate scenarios.

INSURANCE
    OPERATIONS

Aflac’s insurance business consists of two segments: Aflac
    Japan and Aflac U.S. Aflac Japan, which operates as a
    branch of Aflac, is the principal contributor to consolidated
    earnings. GAAP financial reporting requires that a company
    report financial and descriptive information about operating
    segments in its annual financial statements. Furthermore, we are
    required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain
    revenue and expense items, and segment assets.

We measure and evaluate our insurance segments’ financial
    performance using operating earnings on a pretax basis. We
    define segment operating earnings as the profits we derive from
    our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the
    impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. We believe
    that an analysis of segment pretax operating earnings is vitally
    important to an understanding of the underlying profitability
    drivers and trends of our insurance business. Furthermore,
    because a significant portion of our business is conducted in
    Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the
    impact of translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars.

We evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium
    sales. Total new annualized premium sales, which include new
    sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to
    conversions, represent the premiums that we would collect over a

12-month

period, assuming the policies remain in force. For Aflac Japan,
    total new annualized premium sales are determined by
    applications written during the reporting period. For Aflac
    U.S., total new annualized premium sales are determined by
    applications that are accepted during the reporting period.
    Premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial performance
    measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been
    earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period.

The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of
    premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force
    in yen of 3.9% in 2007, 5.4% in 2006 and 6.8% in 2005, reflect
    the high persistency of Aflac Japan’s business and the
    sales of new policies. Annualized premiums in force at
    December 31, 2007, were 1.13 trillion yen, compared with
    1.08 trillion yen in 2006 and 1.03 trillion yen in 2005.
    Annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at
    respective year-end exchange rates, were $9.9 billion in
    2007, $9.1 billion in 2006, and $8.7 billion in 2005.

Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar-denominated and
    reverse-dual currency securities (yen-denominated debt
    securities with dollar coupon payments). Dollar-denominated
    investment income from these assets accounted for approximately
    39% of Aflac Japan’s investment income in 2007, compared
    with 37% in 2006 and 32% in 2005. In years when the yen
    strengthens in relation to the

II-17


dollar, translating Aflac Japan’s dollar-denominated
    investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net
    investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax
    operating earnings in yen terms. In years when the yen weakens,
    translating dollar-denominated investment income into yen
    magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total
    operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms.
    On a constant currency basis, dollar-denominated investment
    income accounted for approximately 39% of Aflac Japan’s
    investment income during 2007, compared with 36% in 2006 and 32%
    in 2005. The following table illustrates the effect of
    translating Aflac Japan’s dollar-denominated investment
    income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment
    results with those that would have been reported had yen/dollar
    exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year.

The benefit ratio has declined over the past several years,
    reflecting the impact of newer products and riders with lower
    loss ratios. We have also experienced favorable claim trends in
    our major product lines. We expect the improvement in the
    benefit ratio to continue as we shift to newer products and
    riders and benefit from the impact of favorable claim trends.
    However, this improvement is partially offset by the effect of
    low investment yields, which impacts our profit margin by
    reducing the spread between investment yields and required
    interest on policy reserves (see table and discussion in the
    Interest Rate Risk section of this MD&A). We expect the
    operating expense ratio to increase modestly in 2008. Due to
    improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit
    margin expanded to 16.8% in 2007. We expect continued expansion
    in the profit margin in 2008.

II-18


Aflac Japan
    Sales

As discussed last year, we expected sales to decline in the
    first half of 2007 and to be flat to up 4% in the second half.
    Consistent with our expectations, Aflac Japan’s total new
    annualized premium sales in yen declined 6.9% in the first six
    months of 2007 but increased 2.5% in the last six months of
    2007, resulting in an overall decrease of 2.4% for the full
    year, compared with 2006. The sales decline primarily reflected
    industrywide weakness in the market for stand-alone medical
    insurance as well as continued declines in the sales of Rider
    MAX and ordinary life products. The following table presents
    Aflac Japan’s total new annualized premium sales for the
    years ended December 31.

Cancer insurance was our top-selling product category for Aflac
    Japan in 2007 with sales rising 12.9% over 2006. We expect
    cancer insurance sales to remain strong in part because of the
    successful introduction of Cancer Forte, which is the first
    major revision we have made to our cancer product category in
    six years. With Cancer Forte, we increased outpatient benefits.
    In addition to our traditional first-occurrence benefit, this
    product also pays an annuity to a newly diagnosed patient from
    the second year through the fifth year following diagnosis. It
    also assists policyholders with counseling and doctor referral
    services through a third party upon diagnosis of the disease.
    Our cancer life policies are also marketed by Dai-ichi Mutual
    Life and in June 2006, Dai-ichi Life began selling a new cancer
    product customized for their market. In 2007, Dai-ichi Life sold
    nearly 244,000 of our market-leading cancer life policies,
    enabling Dai-ichi Life to retain its distinction as the number
    two seller of cancer insurance behind only Aflac Japan. We are
    convinced that the affordable cancer products Aflac Japan
    provides will continue to be an important part of our product
    portfolio.

Medical sales decreased 3.8% in 2007. However, as the year
    progressed, medical sales improved, primarily resulting from the
    success of Gentle EVER, our new nonstandard medical product that
    was introduced in August 2007. With continued cost pressure on
    Japan’s health care system, we expect the need for medical
    products will continue to rise in the future and we remain
    encouraged

II-19


about the outlook for the medical insurance market. Although the
    market is very competitive, Aflac Japan remained the number one
    seller of stand-alone medical insurance in Japan in 2007. We
    believe that our number one position benefits us in the
    marketplace. As a result, we continue to believe that the
    medical category will be an important part of our product
    portfolio.

We believe that there is still a strong need for our products in
    Japan. Our objective is to increase sales 3% to 7% in 2008,
    including contributions from our new distribution channels which
    we expect to gradually increase throughout the year (see the
    Japanese Regulatory Environment section of this MD&A for
    further discussion regarding these distribution channels).

Aflac Japan
    Investments

Growth of investment income in yen is affected by available cash
    flow from operations, timing of and yields on new investments,
    and the effect of yen/dollar exchange rates on
    dollar-denominated investment income. Aflac Japan has invested
    in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than
    Japanese government or other public corporate bonds would have
    provided, while still adhering to prudent standards for credit
    quality. All of our privately issued securities are rated
    investment grade at the time of purchase. These securities are
    generally issued with standard documentation for medium-term
    note programs and have appropriate covenants.

Japanese
    Economy

The Bank of Japan’s January 2008 Monthly Report of Recent
    Economic & Financial Developments stated that
    Japan’s economy is expanding moderately. Private
    consumption has been steady, while household income has
    increased moderately. Business investment in plant and equipment
    has continued to trend upward against the background of high
    corporate profits. However, mainly due to the drop in housing
    investment, the pace of growth for Japan’s economy has been
    slowing. Housing investment is expected to recover gradually,
    and business investment in plant and equipment and private
    consumption are likely to increase due to high corporate profits
    and the moderate rise in household income. However, public
    investment is projected to be on a downtrend. The report
    projected that Japan’s economy is expected to continue
    expanding moderately, however at a slow pace. We believe that
    although the Japanese economy has been growing in recent years,
    the ability to sustain such expansion remains uncertain.

II-20


Japan’s system of compulsory public health care insurance
    provides medical coverage to every Japanese citizen. These
    public medical expenditures are covered by a combination of
    premiums paid by insureds and their employers, taxes and
    copayments from the people who receive medical service. However,
    given Japan’s aging population, the resources available to
    these publicly funded social insurance programs have come under
    increasing pressure. As a result, copayments and other
    out-of-pocket expenses have been rising and affecting more
    people. We believe higher out-of-pocket expenses will lead
    consumers to purchase more supplemental medical insurance. Many
    insurance companies have recognized the opportunities for
    selling supplemental medical insurance in Japan and have
    launched new products in recent years. However, we believe our
    favorable cost structure compared with other insurers makes us a
    very effective competitor. In addition, we believe our brand,
    customer service and financial strength also benefit our market
    position.

Japanese
    Regulatory Environment

Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) adopted new
    mortality tables for reserving newly underwritten policies
    effective April 2007. These new tables reflect recent
    improvements in survival rates in Japan and have generally
    resulted in a decrease in policy premiums for death benefit
    products and an increase in premium rates for third sector
    (health) products and annuities. We reflected the impact of the
    new mortality table in our product pricing for the first sector
    (life) products effective April 2007. For the third sector, the
    revised tables were reflected in our product pricing effective
    September 2007.

Additionally, the FSA has implemented a new rule for third
    sector product reserving. The new reserving rule was effective
    April 1, 2007. Under the new rule, we are required to
    conduct stress testing of our reserves using a prescribed method
    that incorporates actual morbidity. The results of the tests and
    their relation to our reserves determine whether reserve
    strengthening is required. This new reserve requirement will not
    impact our GAAP financial statements, and we currently estimate
    that adoption of this requirement will not have a material
    impact on our 2007 FSA-based financial statements or on our
    product pricing.

At the end of 2006, Aflac Japan, along with the entire life
    insurance industry, began a review of the last five years of
    paid claims to determine if those claims were paid fully and
    accurately. In April 2007, Aflac Japan reported the findings of
    its review to the FSA. In October 2007, the insurance industry
    updated its data for underpaid claims. The updated data for the
    industry included an increase in the number of cases and yen
    amount of underpayment compared to the data that was first
    reported in April, primarily a result of a type of underpayment
    where companies did not notify policyholders of their potential
    eligibility for additional benefit payments, which the
    policyholders did not claim in their original claim filings. Our
    initial estimate for that type of underpayment was fairly
    accurate and the number of cases was very small. In the fourth
    quarter we reported 26,700 cases of delayed interest payments on
    cash surrender values, which on average was 75 yen per case
    (approximately $.66 per case using the December 31, 2007,
    period-end exchange rate). In total for the five-year period, we
    reported 1.9 billion yen (approximately $16.8 million
    using the December 31, 2007, period-end exchange rate) of
    underpaid claims in April, and we revised the amount to
    2.1 billion yen (approximately $18.4 million using the
    December 31, 2007, period-end exchange rate) in October. We
    are using this review to identify process changes that will help
    ensure that payment errors such as these are not repeated. The
    financial impact of paying the claims that were in error was
    immaterial to our operations and has been provided for in our

We expect that our distribution system will continue to evolve
    in Japan. Regulatory changes that took effect in December 2007
    enable banks to sell our products to their customers. We believe
    that it will take time for momentum to build in the bank channel
    for selling third sector products. However, our strong brand as
    the leading seller of cancer and medical insurance products in
    Japan and our extensive, long-standing relationships with more
    than 60% of Japan’s banks place us in a strong position to
    sell through this new channel. By the end of January 2008, we
    had agreements with 41 banks to market Aflac’s products
    through more than 3,300 branches nationwide.

In October 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing Japan’s
    postal system (Japan Post) was enacted into law. The
    privatization laws split Japan Post into four entities that
    began operating in October 2007. The four entities are Japan
    Post Service Co., Ltd.; Japan Post Network Co., Ltd.; Japan Post
    Bank Co., Ltd.; and Japan Post Insurance Co., Ltd. In November
    2007, Japan Post Network Co. selected Aflac Japan as its
    provider of cancer insurance to be sold through Japan’s
    vast post office network. Japan Post Network Co. operates the
    24,000 post offices located throughout Japan, providing a
    significant opportunity for us to reach new consumers.

The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of
    premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force
    of 10.0% in 2007, 10.5% in 2006, and 10.0% in 2005 were
    favorably affected by increased sales at the worksite primarily
    through cafeteria plans and a slight improvement in the
    persistency of several products. Annualized premiums in force at
    December 31 were $4.5 billion in 2007, compared with
    $4.1 billion in 2006 and $3.7 billion in 2005. Net
    investment income is expected to be flat for 2008 compared with
    2007 due to the transfer of approximately $450 million to
    the Parent Company from Aflac U.S. to support the expected
    increase in share repurchases in 2008.

After several years of trending upward, the benefit ratio
    declined in 2007 and 2006, primarily reflecting favorable claim
    cost trends on our major product lines. We expect the benefit
    ratio, operating expense ratio, and pretax operating profit
    margin to remain relatively stable in 2008.

Aflac U.S.
    Sales

For 2007, total new annualized premium sales increased 9.5%,
    which was at the upper end of our objective of 6% to 10% growth
    for the year. An administrative change in the timing of
    agents’ production credit for delay-bill policy conversions
    accelerated approximately $8 million of conversion premiums
    from the first quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2007.
    Excluding the impact of the change in conversion processing,
    total new annualized premium sales were up 8.9% for 2007. The
    following table presents Aflac’s U.S. total new
    annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31.

II-24


One aspect of our growth strategy is the continued enhancement
    of our product line. In August 2007, Aflac U.S. introduced
    a new cancer product, Maximum Difference. This new cancer
    indemnity plan incorporates coverage for medical advances in
    cancer prevention, diagnostics, treatment and the many new ways
    cancer patients may now receive their care. Maximum Difference
    allows customization of coverage to fit varying needs and
    budgets.

Another aspect of our growth strategy is our focus on growing
    and improving our U.S. sales force, and we were encouraged
    to see continued expansion in 2007. We recruited more than
    24,200 new sales associates in 2007, resulting in more than
    71,200 licensed sales associates at December 31, 2007, a
    4.2% increase compared with 2006. Over the last two years, our
    primary focus has been on increasing the number of average
    weekly producers, which measures producers who make solid,
    consistent contributions to sales. On a weekly basis, the
    average number of U.S. associates actively producing
    business rose 6.0% to more than 10,900 in 2007. Our focus on
    average weekly producers as both a reporting and management
    metric provides for a more active management of our sales
    associates and allows our sales management to monitor progress
    and needs on a real-time basis.

II-25


ANALYSIS OF
    FINANCIAL CONDITION

Our financial condition has remained strong in the functional
    currencies of our operations during the last two years. The
    yen/dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to
    translate yen-denominated balance sheet items to
    U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The exchange rate at
    December 31, 2007, was 114.15 yen to one dollar, or 4.3%
    stronger than the December 31, 2006, exchange rate of
    119.11. The stronger yen increased reported investments and cash
    by $1.9 billion, total assets by $2.1 billion, and
    total liabilities by $2.1 billion, compared with the
    amounts that would have been reported for 2007 if the exchange
    rate had remained unchanged from December 31, 2006.

Market Risks of
    Financial Instruments

Because we invest in fixed-income securities, our financial
    instruments are exposed primarily to two types of market risks:
    currency risk and interest rate risk.

Currency
    Risk

The functional currency of Aflac Japan’s insurance
    operation is the Japanese yen. All of Aflac Japan’s
    premiums, claims and commissions are received or paid in yen, as
    are most of its investment income and other expenses.
    Furthermore, most of Aflac Japan’s investments, cash and
    liabilities are yen-denominated. When yen-denominated securities
    mature or are sold, the proceeds are generally reinvested in
    yen-denominated securities. Aflac Japan holds these
    yen-denominated assets to fund its yen-denominated policy
    obligations. In addition, Aflac Incorporated has yen-denominated
    notes payable and cross-currency swaps related to its
    dollar-denominated senior notes.

Although we generally do not convert yen into dollars, we do
    translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for
    financial reporting purposes. Therefore, reported amounts are
    affected by foreign currency fluctuations. We report unrealized
    foreign currency translation gains and losses in other
    comprehensive income.

On a consolidated basis, we attempt to minimize the exposure of
    shareholders’ equity to foreign currency translation
    fluctuations. We accomplish this by investing a portion of Aflac
    Japan’s investment portfolio in dollar-denominated
    securities, by the Parent Company’s issuance of
    yen-denominated debt and by the use of cross-currency swaps (see
    the Hedging Activities section of this MD&A for additional
    information). As a result, the effect of currency fluctuations
    on our net assets is mitigated. The dollar values of our
    yen-denominated net assets, which are subject to foreign
    currency translation fluctuations for financial reporting
    purposes, are summarized as follows (translated at end-of-period
    exchange rates) for the years ended December 31:

Actual year-end exchange rate

We are exposed to economic currency risk only when yen funds are
    actually converted into dollars. This primarily occurs when we
    repatriate funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., which is done
    annually. The exchange rates prevailing at the time of
    repatriation will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at
    the time the yen profits were earned. These repatriations have
    not been greater than 80% of Aflac Japan’s prior-year
    earnings determined in accordance with standards established by
    the FSA. A portion of the repatriation may be used to service
    Aflac Incorporated’s yen-denominated notes payable with the
    remainder converted into dollars.

II-27


Interest Rate
    Risk

Our primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes
    in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt
    securities. We use modified duration analysis, which measures
    price percentage volatility, to estimate the sensitivity of fair
    values to interest rate changes on debt securities we own. For
    example, if the current duration of a debt security is 10, then
    the fair value of that security will increase by approximately
    10% if market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points,
    assuming all other factors remain constant. Likewise, the fair
    value of the debt security will decrease by approximately 10% if
    market interest rates increase by 100 basis points,
    assuming all other factors remain constant.

The estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on
    the fair values of debt securities we own, notes payable,
    cross-currency swaps and our obligation to the Japanese
    policyholder protection corporation as of December 31 follows:

Changes in the interest rate environment impact the fair value
    of our debt securities and, as a result, directly affect the
    balance of unrealized gains or losses for a given period in
    relation to a prior period. Decreases in market yields generate
    unrealized gains and increases in market yields generate
    unrealized losses. However, we would not expect to realize a
    majority of those unrealized gains or losses because we have the
    intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity or
    recovery of value. For additional information on unrealized
    losses on debt securities, see Note 3 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration

Represents yen-denominated investments for Aflac Japan that
    support policy obligations and therefore excludes Aflac
    Japan’s annuities, and dollar-denominated investments and
    related investment income

In response to low interest rates in the United States, we
    lowered our required interest assumption for newly issued
    products to 5.5% in 2005. In Japan, we lowered our required
    interest assumption for some newly issued products to 2.5% in
    2005. However, the majority of Japan’s newly issued
    products have a required interest assumption of 3.0%. We
    continue to monitor the spread between our new money yield and
    the required interest assumption for newly issued products in
    both the United States and Japan and will re-evaluate those
    assumptions as necessary.

Over the next two years, we have yen-denominated securities that
    will mature with yields in excess of Aflac Japan’s current
    net investment yield of 3.83%. These securities total
    $1.9 billion at amortized cost and have an average yield of
    5.70%. Currently, when our debt securities mature, the proceeds
    may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required
    for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies
    issued in earlier years. As a result, securities that mature may
    contribute to a decline in our overall portfolio yield. However,
    adding riders to our older policies has helped offset the
    negative investment spread. Despite negative investment spreads,
    adequate overall profit margins still exist in Aflac
    Japan’s aggregate block of business because of profits that
    have emerged from changes in the mix of business and favorable
    experience from mortality, morbidity and expenses.

II-29


Investments and
    Cash

Our investment philosophy is to maximize investment income while
    emphasizing liquidity, safety and quality. Our investment
    objective, subject to appropriate risk constraints, is to fund
    policyholder obligations and other liabilities in a manner that
    enhances shareholders’ equity. We seek to achieve this
    objective through a diversified portfolio of fixed-income
    investments that reflects the characteristics of the liabilities
    it supports. Aflac invests primarily within the debt securities
    markets.

We have investments in both publicly and privately issued
    securities. However, the status of issuance should not be viewed
    as an indicator of liquidity or as a limitation on the
    determination of fair value. The outstanding amount of a
    particular issuance, as well as the level of activity in a
    particular issuance and market conditions, including credit
    events and the interest rate environment, affect liquidity
    regardless of type of issuance. We routinely assess the fair
    value of all of our investments. This process includes
    evaluating quotations provided by outside securities pricing
    sources

and/or

compiled using data provided by external debt and equity market
    sources, as described more fully in Note 3 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table

    compared with 68.8% at December 31, 2006. Privately issued
    securities held by Aflac Japan at amortized cost accounted for
    $36.0 billion, or 66.0%, of total debt securities at
    December 31, 2007, compared with $31.3 billion, or
    64.0%, of total debt securities at December 31, 2006.
    Reverse-dual currency debt securities accounted for

    securities at December 31, 2007, compared with
    $9.7 billion, or 28.9%, of total privately issued
    securities at December 31, 2006. Aflac Japan has invested
    in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than
    those available from Japanese government bonds. Aflac
    Japan’s investments in yen-denominated privately issued
    securities consist primarily of non-Japanese issuers and have
    longer maturities, thereby allowing us to improve our
    asset/liability matching and our overall investment returns.
    Most of our privately issued securities are issued under
    medium-term note programs and have standard documentation,
    except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional
    protective

and/or

event-risk covenants are required.

Our investment activities expose us to credit risk, which is a
    consequence of extending credit

and/or

carrying investment positions. However, we continue to adhere to
    prudent standards for credit quality. We accomplish this by
    considering our product needs and overall corporate objectives,
    in addition to credit risk. In evaluating the initial rating, we
    look at the overall senior issuer rating, the explicit rating
    for the actual issue or the rating for the security class, and,
    where applicable, the appropriate designation from the
    Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of
    Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). All of our securities have
    ratings from either a nationally recognized statistical rating
    organization or the SVO of the NAIC. In addition, we perform
    extensive internal credit reviews to ensure that we are
    consistent in applying rating criteria for all of our
    securities. In light of recent market activity surrounding the
    subprime lending market, we have performed a review of our
    investment portfolio. We have no direct investment exposure to
    the subprime lending market and have not identified any material
    indirect exposure to that market.

We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both
    existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use
    several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit
    rating services and

internal credit analysis. The distributions by credit rating of
    our purchases of debt securities for the years ended

The increase in AAA and AA rated holdings compared with
    December 31, 2006, resulted from purchases and credit
    rating upgrades by rating agencies; the offset was a
    corresponding decrease in the A rated holdings. The decline in
    BB or lower rated securities resulted from the upgrade of KLM
    Royal Dutch Airlines from below investment grade to investment
    grade during the second quarter of 2007.

In the event of a credit rating downgrade to
    below-investment-grade status, we do not automatically liquidate
    our position. However, if the security is in the
    held-to-maturity portfolio, we immediately transfer it to the
    available-for-sale portfolio so that the security’s fair
    value and its unrealized gain or loss are reflected on the
    balance sheet.

Once we designate a security as below investment grade, we
    intensify our monitoring of the issuer. We do not automatically
    recognize an impairment if the security’s amortized cost
    exceeds its fair value. Our investment management starts by
    reviewing its credit analysis. Included in this process are an
    evaluation of the issuer, its current credit and liquidity
    posture, its operations and an assessment of the future
    prospects for the issuer. We then obtain fair value information
    from at least three independent pricing sources. Upon
    determining the fair value, we move our focus to an analysis of
    whether the decline in fair value, if any, is other than
    temporary. For securities with an amortized cost in excess of
    fair value, investment management then reviews the issue based
    on our impairment policy to determine if the investment should
    be impaired

and/or

liquidated. The assessment of

II-32


whether a decline is other than temporary requires significant
    management judgment and is discussed more fully in the Critical
    Accounting Estimates section of this MD&A. Securities
    classified as below investment grade as of December 31 were as

Investment grade at respective reporting date

Occasionally a debt security will be split rated. This occurs
    when one rating agency rates the security as investment grade
    while another rating agency rates the same security as below
    investment grade. Our policy is to review each issue on a

case-by-case

basis to determine if a split-rated security should be
    classified as investment grade or below investment grade. Our
    review includes evaluating the issuer’s credit position as
    well as current market pricing and other factors, such as the
    issuer’s or security’s inclusion on a credit rating
    downgrade watch list. Split-rated securities as of
    December 31, 2007, represented .7% of total debt securities
    at amortized cost and were as follows:

The fair value of our investments in debt securities can
    fluctuate as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign
    currency exchange rates, and credit issues. Declines in fair
    value noted above resulted from changes in interest rates,
    yen/dollar exchange rates, and issuer credit status, as well as
    increasing risk premiums. However, we believe that it would be
    inappropriate to recognize impairment charges because we believe
    the changes in fair value are temporary. Based on our evaluation
    and analysis of specific issuers in accordance with our
    impairment policy, impairment charges recognized in 2007 were
    $23 million, before taxes. Impairment charges in 2006 and
    2005 were immaterial.

Realized losses on debt securities, as a result of sales and
    impairment charges, were as follows for the year ended

    The ratio of debt to total capitalization (debt plus
    shareholders’ equity, excluding the unrealized gains and
    losses on investment securities) was 15.6% as of
    December 31, 2007, compared with 17.2% a year ago. See
    Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information.

Benefit

II-36


Policyholder
    Protection Corporation

The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection
    system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent
    insurers. In 2005, legislation was enacted extending the
    framework of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection
    Corporation (LIPPC), which included government fiscal measures
    supporting the LIPPC through March 2009. These measures do not
    contemplate additional industry assessments through March 2009
    absent an event requiring LIPPC funds. The likelihood and timing
    of future assessments, if any, cannot be determined at this time.

Hedging
    Activities

Aflac has limited hedging activities. Our primary exposure to be
    hedged is our investment in Aflac Japan, which is affected by
    changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. To mitigate this
    exposure, we have taken the following courses of action. First,
    Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar-denominated
    securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a
    portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. Second, we have
    designated the Parent Company’s yen-denominated liabilities
    (Samurai and Uridashi notes payable and cross-currency swaps) as
    a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. If the total of these
    yen-denominated liabilities is equal to or less than our net
    investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective
    and the related exchange effect is reported in the unrealized
    foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. Should
    these yen-denominated liabilities exceed our investment in Aflac
    Japan, the portion of the hedge that exceeds our investment in
    Aflac Japan would be deemed ineffective. As required by
    SFAS No. 133, we would then recognize the foreign
    exchange effect on the ineffective portion in net earnings
    (other income). We estimate that if the ineffective portion was
    10 billion yen, we would report a foreign exchange
    gain/loss of approximately $1 million for every one yen
    weakening/strengthening in the end-of-period yen/dollar exchange
    rate. At December 31, 2007, our hedge was effective with
    yen-denominated assets exceeding yen-denominated liabilities by
    105.2 billion yen, compared with 105.4 billion yen at
    December 31, 2006.

We have interest rate swap agreements related to the
    20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes. By
    entering into these contracts, we have been able to lock in our
    interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We have designated these interest
    rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash
    flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes.
    The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal
    amount and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes,
    and the swaps had no value at inception. Changes in the fair
    value of the swap contracts are recorded in other comprehensive
    income. The fair value of these swaps and related changes in
    fair value were immaterial during the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006. See Note 4 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Off Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

As of December 31, 2007, we had no material unconditional
    purchase obligations that were not recorded on the balance
    sheet. Additionally, we had no material letters of credit,
    standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase
    obligations.

II-37


CAPITAL RESOURCES
    AND LIQUIDITY

Aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the Parent
    Company through dividends and management fees. Aflac paid
    dividends to the Parent Company in the amount of
    $1.4 billion in 2007, compared with $665 million in
    2006 and $526 million in 2005. During 2007, Aflac paid
    $80 million to the Parent Company for management fees,
    compared with $68 million in 2006 and $73 million in
    2005. The primary uses of cash by the Parent Company are
    shareholder dividends and our share repurchase program. The
    Parent Company’s sources and uses of cash are reasonably
    predictable. For additional information, see the Financing
    Activities section of this MD&A.

The Parent Company also accesses debt security markets to
    provide additional sources of capital. Capital is primarily used
    to fund business expansion and capital expenditures. We have a
    Shelf Registration Statement (SRS) on file with Japanese
    regulatory authorities to issue up to 100 billion yen of
    yen-denominated Samurai notes in Japan. In June 2007, the Parent
    Company issued 30 billion yen of yen-denominated Samurai
    notes from this SRS. If issued, the remaining 70 billion
    yen (approximately $613 million using the December 31,
    2007, period-end exchange rate) of yen-denominated Samurai notes
    will not be available to U.S. persons. We also have an SRS
    on file with Japanese regulatory authorities to issue up to
    100 billion yen of Uridashi notes in Japan. In September
    2006, the Parent Company issued 45 billion yen of
    yen-denominated Uridashi notes from this SRS. If issued, the
    remaining 55 billion yen (approximately $482 million
    using the December 31, 2007, period-end exchange rate) of
    yen-denominated Uridashi notes will not be available to
    U.S. persons. We believe outside sources for additional
    debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be
    available. For additional information, see Note 7 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are
    premiums and investment income. The primary uses of cash by our
    insurance operations are policy claims, commissions, operating
    expenses, income taxes and payments to the Parent Company for
    management fees and dividends. Both the sources and uses of cash
    are reasonably predictable.

When making an investment decision, our first consideration is
    based on product needs. Our investment objectives provide for
    liquidity through the purchase of investment-grade debt
    securities. These objectives also take into account duration
    matching; and, because of the long-term nature of our business,
    we have adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs.

As a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected
    to gradually increase over the life of a policy. Therefore,
    future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early
    years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims
    payments. We expect our future cash flows from premiums and our
    investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for
    benefits and expenses.

II-38


The following table presents the estimated payments by period of
    our major contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007.
    We translated our yen-denominated obligations using the

    reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the

Not applicable

Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of
    $34 million have been excluded from the tabular disclosure
    above because the timing of cash payment is not reasonably
    estimable.

The distribution of payments for future policy benefits is an
    estimate of all future benefit payments for policies in force as
    of December 31, 2007. These projected values contain
    assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality and
    morbidity. The distribution of payments for unpaid policy claims
    includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting
    claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims. Actual
    amounts and timing of both future policy benefits and unpaid
    policy claims payments may differ significantly from the
    estimates above. We anticipate that the future policy benefit
    liability of $45.7 billion at December 31, 2007, along
    with future net premiums and investment income, will be
    sufficient to fund future policy benefit payments.

Consolidated Cash
    Flows

We translate cash flows for Aflac Japan’s yen-denominated
    items into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange
    rates. In years when the yen weakens, translating yen into
    dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen
    strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to
    be reported. The following table summarizes consolidated cash
    flows by activity for the years ended December 31.

We expect cash provided by operating activities in the future to
    decline as a result of increased U.S. federal tax payments.
    U.S. cash tax payments are expected to increase in 2008
    because we fully utilized our remaining tax credit
    carryforwards. Future cash provided by operating activities will
    also be reduced by the payout of lump-sum benefits to
    policyholders on a closed block of business. The majority of
    these benefit payouts will begin in 2008 and will conclude in
    2012. We anticipate paying out approximately $450 million
    over the five-year period.

Cash used by investing activities for Aflac U.S. and other
    operations in 2005 included the January 2005 return of cash
    collateral from the security lending activities of Aflac
    U.S. at the end of 2004 (approximately $2.6 billion).

Prudent portfolio management dictates that we attempt to match
    the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities.
    Currently, when our debt securities mature, the proceeds may be
    reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of
    policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years.
    However, the long-term nature of our business and our strong
    cash flows provide us with the ability to minimize the effect of
    mismatched durations

and/or

yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. When
    market opportunities arise, we dispose of selected debt
    securities that are available for sale to improve the duration
    matching of our assets and liabilities, improve future
    investment yields,

and/or

rebalance our portfolio. As a result, dispositions before
    maturity can vary significantly from year to year. Dispositions
    before maturity were approximately 4% of the annual average
    investment portfolio of debt securities available for sale
    during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with 7%
    in 2006 and 11% in 2005. Dispositions before maturity in 2006
    and 2005 were impacted by the bond swaps we executed from the
    third quarter of 2005 through the second quarter of 2006.

Financing

Consolidated cash used by financing activities was

    $196 million in 2005. In June 2007, we received
    $242 million in connection with the Parent Company’s
    issuance of yen-denominated Samurai notes, and we paid
    $242 million in connection with the maturity of the 2002
    Samurai notes. In June 2006, the Parent Company paid
    $355 million in connection with the maturity of the 2001
    Samurai notes. In September 2006, the Parent Company received
    $382 million from its issuance of yen-denominated Uridashi
    notes. In October 2005, we paid $261 million in connection
    with the maturity of the 2000 Samurai notes. In July 2005, the
    Parent Company received $360 million from its issuance of
    yen-denominated Samurai notes. Cash returned to shareholders
    through treasury stock purchases and dividends was
    $979 million in 2007, compared with $728 million in

On February 4, 2008, we entered into an agreement for an
    accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program with an affiliate of
    Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
    (Merrill Lynch). Under the agreement, we purchased
    12.5 million shares of our outstanding common stock at
    $60.58 per share for a total purchase price of
    $757 million. The repurchase was funded with internal
    capital. The shares were acquired as a part of previously
    announced share repurchase authorizations by our board of
    directors and will be held in treasury. Under the agreement,
    Merrill Lynch plans to purchase shares of our common stock in
    the open market from time to time until it has acquired a number
    of shares equivalent to the number of shares we purchased from
    Merrill Lynch. At the end of this period, we may receive, or may
    be required to remit, a purchase price adjustment based upon the
    volume weighted-average price of our common stock during the ASR
    program period. Under the terms of the ASR we may elect to
    receive or pay any settlement amount in cash or shares of our
    common stock at our option. The completion and settlement of the
    ASR program is expected to occur during the second quarter of
    2008, although the settlement may occur before the second
    quarter at Merrill Lynch’s option.

Regulatory
    Restrictions

Aflac is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to its
    regulations. The Nebraska insurance department imposes certain
    limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends,
    management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent
    Company. The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval
    for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net
    gain from operations, which excludes net realized investment
    gains, for the previous year determined under statutory
    accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus
    as of the previous year-end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance
    department must approve service arrangements and other
    transactions within the affiliated group of companies. These
    regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of
    management fees or dividends paid by Aflac to the Parent
    Company. A life insurance company’s statutory capital and
    surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the NAIC,
    as modified by the insurance department in the insurance
    company’s state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are
    different from GAAP and are intended to emphasize policyholder
    protection and company solvency.

The continued long-term growth of our business may require
    increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance
    operations. Aflac’s insurance operations may secure
    additional statutory capital through various sources, such as
    internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions
    by the Parent Company from funds generated through debt or
    equity offerings. The NAIC’s risk-based capital (RBC)
    formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify
    inadequately capitalized insurance companies. The RBC formula
    quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and
    interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks
    inherent in the insurer’s operations. Aflac’s RBC
    ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and
    surplus position. Currently, the NAIC has ongoing regulatory
    initiatives relating to revisions to the RBC formula as well as
    numerous initiatives covering insurance products, investments,
    and other actuarial and accounting matters. We believe that we
    will continue to maintain a strong RBC ratio and statutory
    capital and surplus position in future periods.

In addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by
    U.S. insurance regulators, Japan’s FSA may not allow
    profit repatriations or other transfers from Aflac Japan if they
    would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength
    for the protection of policyholders. The FSA maintains its own
    solvency standard. Aflac Japan’s solvency margin ratio
    significantly exceeds regulatory minimums.

Payments are made from Aflac Japan to the Parent Company for
    management fees and to Aflac U.S. for allocated expenses
    and remittances of earnings. During 2007, Aflac Japan paid
    $32 million to the Parent Company for management fees,
    compared with $25 million in 2006 and $28 million in
    2005. Expenses allocated to Aflac Japan were $33 million in
    2007, $32 million in 2006 and $30 million in

II-42


2005. During 2007, Aflac Japan remitted profits of
    $567 million (67.8 billion yen) to Aflac U.S.,
    compared with $442 million (50.0 billion yen) in 2006
    and $374 million (41.2 billion yen) in 2005. For
    additional information on regulatory restrictions on dividends,
    profit repatriations and other transfers, see Note 11 of
    the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Rating
    Agencies

Aflac is rated AA by both Standard & Poor’s and
    Fitch Ratings and Aa2 (Excellent) by Moody’s for financial
    strength. A.M. Best rates Aflac as A+ (Superior) for
    financial strength and operating performance. Aflac
    Incorporated’s senior debt, Samurai notes, and Uridashi
    notes are rated A by Standard & Poor’s, A+ by
    Fitch Ratings, and A2 by Moody’s.

In January 2008, the board of directors declared the first
    quarter 2008 cash dividend of $.24 per share. The dividend is
    payable on March 3, 2008, to shareholders of record at the
    close of business on February 20, 2008. In 2006, the board
    of directors authorized the purchase of 30.0 million shares
    of our common stock. As of December 31, 2007, approximately
    25.6 million shares were available for purchase under the
    2006 share repurchase authorization. In January 2008, the
    Board authorized the purchase of an additional 30.0 million
    shares of our common stock.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our
    evaluation under this framework, management has concluded that
    our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
    of December 31, 2007.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
    issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
    which is included herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

The shareholders and board of directors of Aflac Incorporated:

We have audited Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries’
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). Aflac Incorporated’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made

II-44


only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
    assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries maintained,
    in all material respects, effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Aflac Incorporated and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’
    equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and
    our report dated February 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The shareholders and board of directors of Aflac Incorporated:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity, cash flows,
    and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended December 31, 2007. These consolidated
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the
    Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,

as of
    January 1, 2006. Additionally, as discussed in Notes 1
    and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
    adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
    Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

,

an amendment of
    FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),

as of
    December 31, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Aflac
    Incorporated and subsidiaries’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated February 28, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SUMMARY OF
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business:

Aflac Incorporated (the
    Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (the Company) primarily
    sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States
    and Japan. The Company’s insurance business is marketed and
    administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of
    Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac
    U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of
    Aflac’s policies are individually underwritten and marketed
    through independent agents. Our insurance operations in the
    United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets
    for our insurance business. Aflac Japan accounted for 71% of the
    Company’s total revenues in 2007, 72% in 2006 and 74% in
    2005, and 82% of total assets at both December 31, 2007 and
    2006.

Basis of Presentation:

We prepare our financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles (GAAP). These principles are established
    primarily by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires us to make estimates when recording transactions
    resulting from business operations based on currently available
    information. The most significant items on our balance sheet
    that involve a greater degree of accounting estimates and
    actuarial determinations subject to changes in the future are
    the valuation of investments, deferred policy acquisition costs,
    and liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy
    claims. These accounting estimates and actuarial determinations
    are sensitive to market conditions, investment yields,
    mortality, morbidity, commission and other acquisition expenses,
    and terminations by policyholders. As additional information
    becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the
    recorded estimates will be revised and reflected in operating
    results. Although some variability is inherent in these
    estimates, we believe the amounts provided are adequate.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Parent Company, its majority-owned subsidiaries and those
    entities required to be consolidated under applicable accounting
    standards. All material intercompany accounts and transactions
    have been eliminated.

Translation of Foreign Currencies:

The functional
    currency of Aflac Japan’s insurance operations is the
    Japanese yen. We translate our yen-denominated financial
    statement accounts into U.S. dollars as follows. Assets and
    liabilities are translated at end-of-period exchange rates.
    Realized gains and losses on security transactions are
    translated at the exchange rate on the trade date of each
    transaction. Other revenues, expenses and cash flows are
    translated using average exchange rates for the year. The
    resulting currency translation adjustments are reported in
    accumulated other comprehensive income. We include in earnings
    the realized currency exchange gains and losses resulting from
    transactions. Realized currency exchange gains and losses were
    immaterial during the three-year period ended December 31,
    2007.

Aflac Japan maintains an investment portfolio of
    dollar-denominated securities on behalf of Aflac U.S. The
    functional currency for these investments is the
    U.S. dollar. The related investment income and
    realized/unrealized investment gains and losses are also
    denominated in U.S. dollars.

We have designated the yen-denominated Uridashi and Samurai
    notes issued by the Parent Company and the cross-currency swaps
    as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan (see the section in
    this note titled, “Derivatives”). Outstanding
    principal and related accrued interest on these items are

II-54


translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange
    rates. Currency translation adjustments are recorded through
    other comprehensive income and are included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income.

Insurance Revenue and Expense Recognition:

The
    supplemental health and life insurance policies we issue are
    classified as long-duration contracts. The contract provisions
    generally cannot be changed or canceled during the contract
    period; however, we may adjust premiums for supplemental health
    policies issued in the United States within prescribed
    guidelines and with the approval of state insurance regulatory
    authorities.

Insurance premiums for health and life policies are recognized
    ratably as earned income over the premium payment periods of the
    policies. When revenues are reported, the related amounts of
    benefits and expenses are charged against such revenues, so that
    profits are recognized in proportion to premium revenues during
    the period the policies are expected to remain in force. This
    association is accomplished by means of annual additions to the
    liability for future policy benefits and the deferral and
    subsequent amortization of policy acquisition costs.

The calculation of deferred policy acquisition costs and the
    liability for future policy benefits requires the use of
    estimates based on sound actuarial valuation techniques. For new
    policy issues, we review our actuarial assumptions and
    deferrable acquisition costs each year and revise them when
    necessary to more closely reflect recent experience and studies
    of actual acquisition costs. For policies in force, we evaluate
    deferred policy acquisition costs by major product groupings to
    determine that they are recoverable from future revenues. Any
    resulting adjustment is charged against net earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents
    include cash on hand, money market instruments and other debt
    instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when
    purchased.

Investments:

Our debt securities include
    fixed-maturity securities and perpetual debentures, which are
    classified as either held to maturity or available for sale.
    Securities classified as held to maturity are securities that we
    have the ability and intent to hold to maturity or redemption
    and are carried at amortized cost. All other debt securities and
    our equity securities are classified as available for sale and
    are carried at fair value. If the fair value is higher than the
    amortized cost for debt securities, or the purchase cost for
    equity securities, the excess is an unrealized gain, and if
    lower than cost, the difference is an unrealized loss.

The net unrealized gains and losses on securities available for
    sale, plus the unamortized unrealized gains and losses on debt
    securities transferred to the held-to-maturity portfolio, less
    related deferred income taxes, are recorded through other
    comprehensive income and included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income.

Amortized cost of debt securities is based on our purchase price
    adjusted for accrual of discount, or amortization of premium.
    The amortized cost of debt securities we purchase at a discount
    will equal the face or par value at maturity. Debt securities
    that we purchase at a premium will have an amortized cost equal
    to face or par value at maturity or the call date, if
    applicable. Interest is reported as income when earned and is
    adjusted for amortization of any premium or discount.

Our investments in qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs)
    are accounted for as fixed-maturity or perpetual securities. All
    of our investments in QSPEs are held in our available-for-sale
    portfolio.

II-55


For the collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) held in our
    fixed-maturity securities portfolio, we recognize income using a
    constant effective yield, which is based on anticipated
    prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities.
    When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is
    recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated
    future payments. The net investment in CMO securities is
    adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new
    effective yield been applied at the time of acquisition. This
    adjustment is reflected in net investment income.

We use the specific identification method to determine the gain
    or loss from securities transactions and report the realized
    gain or loss in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Our credit analysts/research personnel routinely monitor and
    evaluate the difference between the amortized cost and fair
    value of our investments. Additionally, credit analysis

and/or

credit rating issues related to specific investments may trigger
    more intensive monitoring to determine if a decline in fair
    value is other than temporary. For investments with a fair value
    below amortized cost, the process includes evaluating the length
    of time and the extent to which amortized cost exceeds fair
    value and the financial condition, operations, credit and
    liquidity posture, and future prospects of the issuer, among
    other factors, in determining the potential recovery in fair
    value or principal. This process is not exact and requires
    consideration of risks such as credit risk, which to a certain
    extent can be controlled, and interest rate risk, which cannot
    be controlled. Therefore, if an investment’s amortized cost
    exceeds its fair value solely due to changes in interest rates,
    impairment may not be appropriate. If, after monitoring and
    analyses, management believes that a decline in fair value is
    other than temporary, we adjust the amortized cost of the
    security and report a realized loss in the consolidated
    statements of earnings.

We lend fixed-maturity securities to financial institutions in
    short-term security lending transactions. These securities
    continue to be carried as investment assets on our balance sheet
    during the terms of the loans and are not reported as sales. We
    receive cash or other securities as collateral for such loans.
    For loans involving unrestricted cash collateral, the collateral
    is reported as an asset with a corresponding liability for the
    return of the collateral. For loans collateralized by
    securities, the collateral is not reported as an asset or
    liability.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs:

The costs of
    acquiring new business are deferred and amortized with interest
    over the premium payment periods in proportion to the ratio of
    annual premium income to total anticipated premium income.
    Anticipated premium income is estimated by using the same
    mortality, persistency and interest assumptions used in
    computing liabilities for future policy benefits. In this
    manner, the related acquisition expenses are matched with
    revenues. Deferred costs include the excess of current-year
    commissions over ultimate renewal-year commissions and certain
    direct and allocated policy issue, underwriting and marketing
    expenses. All of these costs vary with and are primarily related
    to the production of new business.

Policy Liabilities:

Future policy benefits represent
    claims that are expected to occur in the future and are computed
    by a net level premium method using estimated future investment
    yields, persistency and recognized morbidity and mortality
    tables modified to reflect our experience, including a provision
    for adverse deviation. These assumptions are generally
    established at the time a policy is issued.

II-56


Unpaid policy claims are estimates computed on an undiscounted
    basis using statistical analyses of historical claims experience
    adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. The ultimate
    liability may vary significantly from such estimates. We
    regularly adjust these estimates as new claims experience
    emerges and reflect the changes in operating results in the year
    such adjustments are made.

Income Taxes:

Income tax provisions are generally
    based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement
    purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing our
    income tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized for
    temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and
    income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax
    laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which
    we expect the temporary differences to reverse.

Derivatives:

We have limited activity with
    derivative financial instruments. We do not use them for trading
    purposes, nor do we engage in leveraged derivative transactions.
    At December 31, 2007, our only outstanding derivative
    contracts were interest rate swaps related to our
    20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes and
    cross-currency swaps related to our $450 million senior
    notes (see Notes 4 and 7).

We document all relationships between hedging instruments and
    hedged items, as well as our risk-management objectives for
    undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes
    linking derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific
    assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. We also assess, both
    at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives
    and nonderivatives used in hedging activities are highly
    effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of
    the hedged items. The assessment of hedge effectiveness
    determines the noncash accounting treatment of changes in fair
    value.

We have designated our cross-currency swaps as a hedge of the
    foreign currency exposure of our investment in Aflac Japan. We
    include the fair value of the cross-currency swaps in either
    other assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet. We
    report the changes in fair value of the foreign currency portion
    of our cross-currency swaps in other comprehensive income.
    Changes in the fair value of the interest rate component are
    reflected in other income in the consolidated statements of
    earnings.

We have designated our interest rate swaps as a hedge of the
    variability of the interest cash flows associated with the
    variable interest rate Uridashi notes. We include the fair value
    of the interest rate swaps in either other assets or other
    liabilities on the balance sheet. We report the changes in fair
    value of the interest rate swaps in other comprehensive income
    as long as they are deemed effective. Should any portion of the
    swap be deemed ineffective, that value would be reported in
    other income in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Policyholder Protection Corporation and State Guaranty
    Association Assessments:

In Japan, the government has
    required the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder
    protection corporation. We recognize a charge for our estimated
    share of the industry’s obligation once it is determinable.
    We review the estimated liability for policyholder protection
    corporation contributions on an annual basis and report any
    adjustments in Aflac Japan’s expenses.

In the United States, each state has a guaranty association that
    supports insolvent insurers operating in those states. To date,
    our state guaranty association assessments have not been
    material.

II-57


Treasury Stock:

Treasury stock is reflected as a
    reduction of shareholders’ equity at cost. We use the
    weighted-average purchase cost to determine the cost of treasury
    stock that is reissued. We include any gains and losses in
    additional paid-in capital when treasury stock is reissued.

Earnings Per Share:

We compute basic earnings per
    share (EPS) by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average
    number of unrestricted shares outstanding for the period.
    Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the
    weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period
    plus the shares representing the dilutive effect of share-based
    awards.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

In December 2007, the
    FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
    No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements - an amendment of ARB No. 51
    (SFAS 160). The purpose of SFAS 160 is to improve
    relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial
    information in consolidated financial statements of reporting
    entities that hold noncontrolling interests in one or more
    subsidiaries. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning on or after December 15, 2008, with earlier
    adoption prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of this
    standard to have any effect on our financial position or results
    of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities - including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 allows entities to
    choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other
    items at fair value. The majority of the provisions of this
    standard apply only to entities that elect the fair value option
    (FVO). The FVO may be applied to eligible items on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis; is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs; and may
    only be applied to an entire financial instrument, and not
    portions thereof. This standard requires a business enterprise
    to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the FVO
    has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
    SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, with earlier application permitted under
    limited circumstances. We do not expect the adoption of this
    standard to have a material effect on our financial position or
    results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
    Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). We adopted the
    recognition and measurement date provisions of this standard
    effective December 31, 2006. In the consolidated statements
    of shareholders’ equity for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, we included in 2006 other comprehensive
    income, a cumulative transition adjustment, net of income taxes,
    of $44 million from the adoption of SFAS 158. This
    cumulative effect adjustment was properly included in the
    rollforward of accumulated other comprehensive income for the
    year, but it should not have been included in other
    comprehensive income for the year. Total comprehensive income
    for the year, not including the transition adjustment for
    SFAS 158, was $996 million. Management concluded that
    the transition adjustment was not material to the financial
    statements taken as a whole. We have adjusted other
    comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    to properly reflect the transition adjustment as a direct charge
    to accumulated other comprehensive income. The effect of
    recording the transition adjustment through other comprehensive
    income and the subsequent adjustment to reflect the amounts as a
    direct charge to accumulated other comprehensive income did not
    have any impact on the consolidated statements of earnings, the
    consolidated balance sheets, the consolidated statements of
    shareholders’ equity or the consolidated statements of cash
    flows for any periods presented.

II-58


In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair
    Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under
    GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    This standard applies to other accounting pronouncements that
    require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having
    previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that
    fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly,
    SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements.
    Where applicable, this standard codifies related guidance within
    GAAP. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007, with earlier application
    encouraged under limited circumstances. We do not expect the
    adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our
    financial position or results of operations.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48
    (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. The provisions of
    FIN 48 clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
    Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance
    with FIN 48 is a two-step process. Under the first step,
    the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not
    that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing
    authorities. The second step is measurement, whereby a tax
    position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition
    threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to
    recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is
    measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than
    50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
    FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with
    earlier application encouraged. We adopted the provisions of
    this standard effective January 1, 2007. The adoption of
    this standard did not have any impact on our financial position
    or results of operations (see Note 8).

In September 2005, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee
    of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
    (AICPA) issued Statement of Position (SOP)

05-1,

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition
    Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance
    Contracts

(SOP 05-1).

SOP 05-1

provides accounting guidance on internal replacements of
    insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically
    described in SFAS No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by
    Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and
    for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments.

SOP 05-1

is effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2006, with earlier adoption
    encouraged. Retrospective application of this SOP to previously
    issued financial statements is not permitted. We adopted the
    provisions of this statement effective January 1, 2007. We
    have determined that certain of our policy modifications in both
    the United States and Japan that were previously accounted for
    as a continuation of existing coverage will be considered
    internal replacements that are substantially changed as
    contemplated by

SOP 05-1

and will be accounted for as the extinguishment of the affected
    policies and the issuance of new contracts. The adoption of this
    statement increased net earnings by $6 million, or $.01 per
    diluted share, and was insignificant to our financial position
    and results of operations.

Recent accounting pronouncements not discussed above are not
    applicable to our business.

II-59


Securities and Exchange Commission Guidance:

In
    September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108
    (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses quantifying the financial
    statement effects of misstatements, specifically, how the
    effects of uncorrected errors from prior years must be
    considered in quantifying misstatements in current year
    financial statements. Under the provisions of SAB 108, a
    reporting entity must quantify and evaluate errors using a
    balance sheet approach and an income statement approach. After
    considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors,
    if either approach results in a misstatement that is material, a
    reporting entity’s financial statements must be adjusted.
    SAB 108 applies to SEC registrants and is effective for
    fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. In the course
    of evaluating balance sheet amounts in accordance with the
    provisions of SAB 108, we identified the following amounts
    that we adjusted for as of January 1, 2006: a tax liability
    in the amount of $87 million related to deferred tax asset
    valuation allowances that were not utilized; a tax liability in
    the amount of $45 million related to various provisions for
    taxes that were not utilized; and a litigation liability in the
    amount of $11 million related to provisions for various
    pending lawsuits that were not utilized. These liabilities were
    recorded in immaterial amounts prior to 2004 over a period
    ranging from 10 to 15 years. However, using the dual
    evaluation approach prescribed by SAB 108, correction of
    the above amounts would be material to 2006 earnings. In
    accordance with the provisions of SAB 108, the following
    amounts, net of tax where applicable, have been reflected as an
    opening adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1,
    2006: a reduction of tax liabilities in the amount of
    $132 million; a reduction of litigation reserves in the
    amount of $11 million; and a reduction in deferred tax
    assets in the amount of $4 million. These three adjustments
    resulted in a net addition to retained earnings in the amount of
    $139 million.

2. BUSINESS
    SEGMENT AND FOREIGN INFORMATION

The Company consists of two reportable insurance business
    segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S., both of which sell
    individual supplemental health and life insurance.

Operating business segments that are not individually reportable
    are included in the “Other business segments”
    category. We do not allocate corporate overhead expenses to
    business segments. We evaluate and manage our business segments
    using a financial performance measure called pretax operating
    earnings. Our definition of operating earnings excludes the
    following items from net earnings on an after-tax basis:
    realized investment gains/losses, the impact from SFAS 133,
    and nonrecurring items. We then exclude income taxes related to
    operations to arrive at pretax operating earnings. Information
    regarding operations by segment for the years ended December 31

Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar-denominated
    securities, which serves as an economic currency hedge of a
    portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. We have designated the
    Parent Company’s yen-denominated notes payable and
    cross-currency swaps as a hedge of our investment in Aflac
    Japan. The dollar values of our yen-denominated net assets,
    which are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations
    for financial reporting purposes, are summarized as follows at
    December 31 (translated at end-of-period exchange rates):

Policyholder Protection Corporation:

The total
    liability accrued for our obligations to the Japanese Life
    Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC) was
    $151 million (17.2 billion yen) at December 31,
    2007, compared with $175 million (20.8 billion yen) a
    year ago. The obligation is payable in semi-annual installments
    through 2013.

Property and Equipment:

The costs of buildings,
    furniture and equipment are depreciated principally on a
    straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum
    of 45 years for buildings and 10 years for furniture
    and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
    expensed as incurred; expenditures for betterments are
    capitalized and depreciated. Classes of property and equipment

Privately issued securities held by Aflac Japan at amortized
    cost accounted for $36.0 billion, or 66.0%, of total debt
    securities at December 31, 2007, compared with
    $31.3 billion, or 64.0%, of total debt securities at
    December 31, 2006. Total privately issued securities, at
    amortized cost, accounted for $38.3 billion, or 70.3%, of
    total debt securities as of December 31, 2007, compared
    with $33.6 billion, or 68.8%, at December 31, 2006. Of
    the total privately issued securities, reverse-dual currency
    debt securities (principal payments in yen, interest payments in
    dollars) accounted for $11.1 billion, or 29.2%, at
    amortized cost as of December 31, 2007, compared with
    $9.7 billion, or 28.9%, at amortized cost as of
    December 31, 2006.

At December 31, 2007, we owned below-investment-grade debt
    securities in the amount of $1.0 billion at amortized cost
    ($815 million at fair value), or 1.9% of total debt
    securities, compared with $1.3 billion at amortized cost
    ($1.1 billion at fair value), or 2.6% of total debt
    securities a year ago. Each of the below-investment-grade
    securities was investment-grade at the time of purchase and was
    subsequently downgraded by credit rating agencies. These
    securities are held in the available-for-sale portfolio.

As of December 31, 2007, $67 million, at fair value,
    of Aflac Japan’s debt securities had been pledged to
    Japan’s policyholder protection corporation. At
    December 31, 2007, debt securities with a fair value of
    $13 million were on deposit with regulatory authorities in
    the United States and Japan. We retain ownership of all
    securities on deposit and receive the related investment income.

In 2007, we realized pretax gains of $28 million
    (after-tax, $19 million, or $.04 per diluted share)
    primarily as a result of securities sold or redeemed in the
    normal course of business. In 2006, we realized pretax gains of
    $79 million (after-tax, $51 million, or $.10 per
    diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps and the
    liquidation of equity securities held by Aflac U.S. In
    2005, we realized pretax gains of $262 million (after-tax,
    $167 million, or $.33 per diluted share) primarily as a
    result of bond swaps. We began a bond-swap program in the second
    half of 2005 and concluded it in the first half of 2006. These
    bond swaps took advantage of tax loss carryforwards and also
    resulted in an improvement in overall portfolio credit quality
    and investment income. Impairment charges recognized in 2007
    were $23 million, before taxes. Impairment charges in 2006
    and 2005 were immaterial.

Fair values of debt securities and privately issued equity
    securities were determined using quotations provided by outside
    securities pricing sources

and/or

compiled using data provided by external debt and equity market
    sources. The data used in estimating fair value include credit
    spreads of comparably credit-rated securities and market
    quotations of securities with similar maturity and call
    structure characteristics. Fair values are then computed using
    standard industry models that provide pricing data based on a
    wide variety of inputs as noted above. The fair values provided
    by outside sources are reviewed internally for reasonableness.
    If a fair value appears unreasonable, the inputs are re-examined
    and the value is confirmed or revised. The fair values for
    publicly traded equity securities were determined using market
    quotations from the public exchange markets where the securities
    are principally traded.

The unrealized losses on our investments in government and
    guaranteed fixed-maturity securities, which include
    U.S. Treasury obligations, direct obligations of
    U.S. government agencies, Japan government bonds, and
    direct obligations of Japan government agencies were caused by
    changes in interest rates

and/or

exchange rates. The contractual cash flows of these investments
    are guaranteed by either the U.S. or Japanese government.
    Furthermore, the contractual terms of these investments do not
    permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than
    the amortized cost of the investment. Because we have the
    ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of
    fair value, which may be maturity, we do not consider these
    investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at
    December 31, 2007.

The unrealized losses on the other investment categories in the
    preceding table were caused by changes in interest rates,
    yen/dollar exchange rates,

and/or

increased credit spreads. For credit-related declines in market
    value, we begin a more focused review of the related
    issuer’s credit ratings, financial statements and other
    available financial data, timeliness of payment, competitive
    environment and any other significant data related to the
    issuer. From those reviews, we evaluate the issuer’s
    continued ability to service our investment. If, based on our
    reviews, we determine that the issuer has the ability to
    continue to service our investment, we conclude that the
    investment is temporarily impaired. Because we have the ability
    and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair
    value, which may be maturity, we do not consider these
    investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at
    December 31, 2007.

Included in the unrealized losses on other corporate
    fixed-maturity securities is an unrealized loss of
    $33 million on Aflac Japan’s $123 million
    (14 billion yen) investment in BAWAG Capital Finance Jersey
    II. The decline in fair value of the security was primarily
    caused by losses BAWAG incurred from lending to the failed
    U.S. brokerage house REFCO and from derivative speculation
    in 2000. While BAWAG’s credit rating has declined from Baa3
    to Ba1 (Moody’s), we currently believe it is probable we
    will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms
    of the investment. Therefore, it is expected that our investment
    would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of
    the investment. Also included in the unrealized losses on other
    corporate fixed-maturity securities is an unrealized loss of
    $67 million on Aflac Japan’s investment of
    $210 million (24 billion yen) in Tollo Shipping
    Company S.A. Our investment is guaranteed by the issuer’s
    parent, Compañia Sudamericana de Vapores S.A. (CSAV). The
    decline in fair value of the security was primarily caused by
    two factors: depressed revenue due to competitive pricing
    pressures in the container shipping industry and weaker
    operating margins due to sharply increased fuel costs. The
    contractual terms of this investment do not permit the issuer or
    its parent to settle the security at a price less than the
    amortized cost of the investment, and give priority to repayment
    of our investment under certain circumstances. While CSAV’s
    credit rating has remained at BB+ (S&P), we currently
    believe it is probable that we will collect all amounts due
    according to the contractual terms of the investment. Therefore,
    it is expected that our investment would not be settled at a
    price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Because we
    have the intent and ability to hold these investments until
    recovery of fair value, which may be the investments’
    respective maturities, we do not consider them to be
    other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2007.

Shareholders’ equity, unrealized gains on investment
    securities

$


$

1,450

Unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities decreased
    primarily as a result of a higher interest rate environment
    driven by wider credit spreads globally and also as a result of
    foreign currency effects.

We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration
    of our liabilities. The following table presents the approximate
    duration of our yen-denominated assets and liabilities, along
    with premiums, as of December 31.

(In years)



Yen-denominated debt securities



Policy benefits and related expenses to be paid in future years



Premiums to be received in future years on policies in force



Currently, when our debt securities mature, the proceeds may be
    reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for
    the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued
    in earlier years. However, our strategy of developing and
    marketing riders to our older policies has helped offset the
    negative investment spread. In spite of the negative investment
    spreads, overall profit margins in Aflac Japan’s aggregate
    block of business are adequate because of profits that continue
    to emerge from changes in mix of business and favorable
    mortality, morbidity and expenses.

The Parent Company has a portfolio of investment-grade
    available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities totaling
    $109 million at amortized cost and $105 million at
    fair value, which is not included in the table above.

Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities
    because some issuers have the right to call or prepay
    obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

We own subordinated perpetual debenture securities. These
    securities are subordinated to other debt obligations of the
    issuer, but rank higher than equity securities. Although these
    securities have no contractual maturity, the interest coupons
    that were fixed at issuance subsequently change to a floating
    short-term interest rate of 125 to more than 300 basis
    points above an appropriate market index, generally by the
    25th year after issuance, thereby creating an economic
    maturity date. The economic maturities of our investments in
    perpetual debentures at December 31, 2007, were as follows:

As part of our investment activities, we own investments in
    qualified special purpose entities (QSPEs). At December 31,
    2007, available-for-sale QSPEs totaled $3.2 billion at fair
    value ($3.3 billion at amortized cost, or 6.0% of total
    debt securities), compared with $2.3 billion at fair value
    ($2.3 billion at amortized cost, or 4.7% of total debt
    securities) at December 31, 2006. We have no equity
    interests in any of the QSPEs, nor do we have control over these
    entities. Therefore, our loss exposure is limited to the cost of
    our investment.

We also own investments in variable interest entities (VIEs)
    totaling $2.1 billion at fair value ($2.4 billion at
    amortized cost, or 4.5% of total debt securities) at
    December 31, 2007. We are the primary beneficiary of VIEs
    totaling $1.3 billion at fair value ($1.6 billion at
    amortized cost) and have consolidated our interests in these
    VIEs in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised
    December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The
    activities of the VIEs that we consolidate are limited to
    holding debt securities and utilizing the cash flows from the
    debt securities to service our investments therein. The terms of
    these debt securities mirror the terms of the notes held by
    Aflac.

We have interests in VIEs in which we are not the primary
    beneficiary and therefore are not required to consolidate
    totaling $760 million at fair value ($853 million at
    amortized cost) as of December 31, 2007. These interests
    primarily consist of corporate collateralized debt obligations
    (CDOs). The activities of these VIEs are limited to holding
    underlying collateral, comprising investment-grade debt
    securities at the time of issuance, and credit default swap
    (CDS) contracts on specific corporate entities and utilizing the
    cash flows from the collateral and CDS contracts to service

II-76


our investments therein. All corporate entities covered by the
    CDS contracts were investment grade at the time of issuance. Our
    remaining VIEs that we are not required to consolidate consist
    of loans to financing vehicles that are irrevocably and
    unconditionally guaranteed by their corporate parents. These
    VIEs are used to raise financing for their respective parent
    companies in the international capital markets. The guarantors
    of these VIEs were investment grade at the time of issuance.

The loss on any of our VIE investments would be limited to its
    cost.

We lend fixed-maturity securities to financial institutions in
    short-term security lending transactions. These short-term
    security lending arrangements increase investment income with
    minimal risk. Our security lending policy requires that the fair
    value of the securities

and/or

cash
    received as collateral be 102% or more of the fair value of the
    loaned securities. At December 31, 2007, we had security
    loans outstanding with a fair value of $790 million, and we
    held cash in the amount of $808 million as collateral for
    these loaned securities. At December 31, 2006, we had
    security loans outstanding with a fair value of
    $780 million, and we held cash in the amount of
    $807 million as collateral for these loaned securities.

During 2007, we reclassified an investment from held to maturity
    to available for sale as a result of a deterioration in the
    issuer’s creditworthiness. At the date of transfer, this
    debt security had an amortized cost of $169 million. The
    investment was subsequently sold at a realized gain of
    $12 million.

During 2006, we reclassified an investment from held to maturity
    to available for sale as a result of the issuer’s credit
    rating downgrade. At the date of transfer, this debt security
    had an amortized cost of $118 million and an unrealized
    loss of $15 million.

During 2005, we reclassified an investment from held to maturity
    to available for sale as a result of the issuer’s credit
    rating downgrade. This debt security had an amortized cost of
    $254 million and an unrealized loss of $46 million at
    the date of transfer.

Cross-currency and interest rate swaps

The methods of determining the fair values of our investments in
    debt and equity securities are described in Note 3. The
    fair values of notes payable with fixed interest rates were
    obtained from an independent financial information service. The
    fair values of our cross-currency swaps are the expected amounts
    that we would receive or pay to terminate the swaps, taking into
    account current interest rates, foreign currency rates and the
    current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. The fair
    value of the obligation to the Japanese policyholder protection
    corporation is our estimated share of the industry’s
    obligation calculated on a pro rata basis by projecting our
    percentage of the industry’s premiums and reserves and
    applying that percentage to the total industry obligation
    payable in future years.

The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables,
    accrued investment income, accounts payable, cash collateral and
    payables for security transactions approximated their fair
    values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
    Consequently, such instruments are not included in the above
    table. The preceding table also excludes liabilities for future
    policy benefits and unpaid policy claims as these liabilities
    are not financial instruments as defined by GAAP.

We have outstanding cross-currency swap agreements related to
    the $450 million senior notes (see Note 7). We have
    designated the foreign currency component of these
    cross-currency swaps as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure
    of our investment in Aflac Japan. The notional amounts and terms
    of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the senior
    notes.

We entered into cross-currency swaps to minimize the impact of
    foreign currency translation on shareholders’ equity and to
    reduce interest expense by converting the dollar-denominated
    principal and interest on the senior notes we issued into
    yen-denominated obligations. By entering into these
    cross-currency swaps, we have been able to reduce our interest
    rate from 6.5% in dollars to 1.67% in yen. See Note 1 for
    information on the accounting policy for cross-currency swaps.

We have entered into interest rate swap agreements related to
    the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes
    (see Note 7). By entering into these contracts, we have
    been able to lock in the interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We have
    designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the
    variability in our interest cash flows associated with the
    variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The notional amounts and
    terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the
    variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The swaps had no value at
    inception. Changes in the fair value of the swap contracts are
    recorded in other comprehensive income. The fair value of these
    swaps and related changes in fair value were immaterial during
    the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to our cross-currency and interest rate swaps.
    The counterparties to our swap agreements are U.S. and

In February 2006, the Parent Company filed a Shelf Registration
    Statement (SRS) with Japanese regulatory authorities to issue up
    to 100 billion yen of yen-denominated Samurai notes in
    Japan. In June 2007, the Parent Company issued yen-denominated
    Samurai notes totaling 30 billion yen. We used the net
    proceeds of these Samurai notes to pay in full the .96% Samurai
    notes that were issued in 2002 and matured in June 2007. These
    Samurai notes issued by the Parent Company in 2007 and those
    issued in 2005 each have five year maturities. Each series of
    Samurai notes pays interest semiannually, may only be redeemed
    prior to maturity upon the occurrence of a tax event as
    specified in the respective bond agreement and is not available
    to U.S. persons.

II-82


In August 2006, the Parent Company filed an SRS with Japanese
    regulatory authorities to issue up to 100 billion yen of
    yen-denominated Uridashi notes in Japan. In September 2006, the
    Parent Company issued three tranches of Uridashi notes totaling
    45 billion yen. The first tranche totaled 15 billion
    yen and has a five-year maturity. The second tranche totaled
    10 billion yen and has a

10-year

maturity. The third tranche totaled 20 billion yen and has
    a five-year maturity and a variable interest coupon of six-month
    yen LIBOR plus a spread. We have entered into interest rate
    swaps related to the 20 billion yen variable interest rate
    notes (see Note 4). Each tranche of Uridashi notes pays
    interest semiannually, may only be redeemed prior to maturity
    upon the occurrence of a tax event as specified in the
    respective bond agreement and is not available to
    U.S. persons. If issued, the 55 billion yen of
    Uridashi notes remaining under the August 2006 SRS will not be
    available to U.S. persons.

For our yen-denominated loans, the principal amount as stated in
    dollar terms will fluctuate from period to period due to changes
    in the yen/dollar exchange rate. We have designated all of our
    yen-denominated notes payable as a hedge of the foreign currency
    exposure of our investment in Aflac Japan. We have also
    designated the interest rate swaps on our variable interest rate
    Uridashi notes as a hedge of the variability in our interest
    cash flows associated with these notes.

In 1999, we issued $450 million of senior notes. These
    notes pay interest semiannually and are redeemable at our option
    at any time with a redemption price equal to the principal
    amount of the notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. We have
    entered into cross-currency swaps related to these notes (see
    Note 4).

The aggregate contractual maturities of notes payable during
    each of the years after December 31, 2007, are as follows:

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than
    not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. In prior
    years, we established valuation allowances primarily for
    alternative minimum tax credit and noninsurance loss
    carryforwards that exceeded projected future offsets. Under
    U.S. income tax rules, only 35% of noninsurance losses can
    be offset against life insurance taxable income each year.

We received regulatory approval for a change in the allocation
    of expenses under the management fee agreement between Aflac and
    the Parent Company in 2005. This enabled the Parent Company to
    fully utilize its tax-basis, non-life operating losses and
    therefore release the valuation allowance on the associated
    deferred tax assets, resulting in a benefit of $34 million
    ($.07 per diluted share) in 2005. For current U.S. income
    tax purposes, there were no alternative minimum tax credit
    carryforwards available at December 31, 2007.

We file federal income tax returns in the United States and
    Japan as well as state or prefecture income tax returns in
    various jurisdictions in the two countries. U.S. federal
    and state income tax returns for years before 2002 are no longer
    subject to examination. We have been examined through
    March 31, 2004, for Japanese tax purposes.

We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), on
    January 1, 2007 (see Note 1). There was no change in
    the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the
    implementation of FIN 48 and therefore no adjustment to
    retained earnings upon adoption. A reconciliation of the
    beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as
    follows:

Amounts do not include tax
    deductions of $14 at January 1, 2007, and

$18 at December 31, 2007.

Included in the balance of the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits at December 31, 2007, are $51 million of tax
    positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly
    certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of
    such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax
    accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance
    of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual
    effective tax rate, but would accelerate the payment of cash to
    the taxing authority to an earlier period. The Company has
    accrued approximately $2 million for permanent
    uncertainties, which if reversed would not have a material
    effect on the annual effective rate.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We recognized
    approximately $3 million in interest and penalties in 2007,
    compared with $2 million in 2006 and $1 million in
    2005. The Company has accrued approximately $32 million for
    the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31,
    2007, compared with $29 million a year ago.

As of December 31, 2007, there were no material uncertain
    tax positions for which the total amounts of unrecognized tax
    benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next
    twelve months.

    1.7 million shares, on a weighted-average basis, as of
    December 31, 2007, were considered to be anti-dilutive and
    were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per
    share, compared with 1.8 million shares in 2006 and

Share Repurchase Program:

In 2004, the Board of
    Directors authorized the purchase of 30.0 million shares of
    our common stock. We exhausted that authorization during the
    second quarter of 2007. In 2006, the Board of Directors
    authorized the purchase of 30.0 million shares of our
    common stock. As of December 31, 2007, approximately
    25.6 million shares were available for purchase under the
    2006 share repurchase authorization. In January 2008, the
    Board authorized the purchase of an additional 30.0 million
    shares of our common stock.

Voting Rights:

In accordance with the Parent
    Company’s articles of incorporation, shares of common stock
    are generally entitled to one vote per share until they have
    been held by the same beneficial owner for a continuous period
    of 48 months, at which time they become entitled to 10
    votes per share.

SHARE-BASED
    TRANSACTIONS

As of December 31, 2007, the Company has outstanding
    share-based awards under two long-term incentive compensation
    plans.

The first plan, which expired in February 2007, is a stock
    option plan which allowed grants for incentive stock options
    (ISOs) to employees and non-qualifying stock options (NQSOs) to
    employees and non-employee directors. The options have a term of
    10 years and generally vest after three years. The strike
    price of options granted under this plan is equal to the fair
    market value of a share of the Company’s common stock at
    the date of grant. Options granted before the plan’s
    expiration date remain outstanding in accordance with their
    terms.

The second long-term incentive compensation plan allows awards
    to Company employees for ISOs, NQSOs, restricted stock,
    restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights.
    Non-employee directors are eligible for grants of NQSOs,
    restricted stock, and stock appreciation rights. Generally, the
    awards vest based upon time-based conditions or time- and
    performance-based conditions. Performance-based vesting
    conditions generally include the attainment of goals related to
    Company financial performance. As of December 31, 2007,
    approximately 22.6 million shares were available for future
    grants under this plan, and the only performance-based awards
    issued and outstanding were restricted stock awards.

Share-based awards granted to

U.S.-based

grantees are settled upon exercise with authorized but unissued
    Company stock, while those issued to Japan-based grantees are
    settled upon exercise with treasury shares.

The following table presents the expense recognized in
    connection with share-based awards for the periods ended
    December 31.

We estimate the fair value of each stock option granted using
    the Black-Scholes-Merton multiple option approach. Expected
    volatility is based on historical periods generally commensurate
    with the estimated term of options. We use historical data to
    estimate option exercise and termination patterns within the
    model. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical
    exercise patterns are stratified and considered separately for
    valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted is
    derived from the output of our option model and represents the
    weighted-average period of time that options granted are
    expected to be outstanding. We base the risk-free interest rate
    on the Treasury note rate with a term comparable to that of the
    estimated term of options. The weighted-average fair value of
    options at their grant date was $16.06 for 2007, compared with
    $15.28 for 2006 and $13.40

As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate intrinsic value of
    stock options outstanding was $467 million, with a
    weighted-average remaining term of 5.5 years. The aggregate
    intrinsic value of stock options exercisable at that same date
    was $398 million, with a weighted-average remaining term of
    4.6 years. The total intrinsic value of stock options
    exercised during the year ended December 31, 2007, was
    $154 million, compared with $62 million in 2006 and
    $114 million in 2005. We received cash from the exercise of
    stock options in the amount of $52 million in 2007,
    compared with $38 million in 2006 and $49 million in
    2005. The tax benefit realized as a result of stock option
    exercises was $51 million in 2007, $19 million in 2006
    and $37 million in 2005.

The value of restricted stock awards is based on the fair market

As of December 31, 2007, total compensation cost not yet
    recognized in our financial statements related to restricted
    stock awards was $20 million, of which $9 million
    (492 thousand shares) was related to share-based awards
    with a performance-based vesting condition. We expect to
    recognize these amounts over a weighted-average period of
    approximately 1.3 years. There are no other contractual
    terms covering restricted stock awards once vested.

STATUTORY
    ACCOUNTING AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

Our insurance subsidiary is required to report its results of
    operations and financial position to state insurance regulatory
    authorities on the basis of statutory accounting practices
    prescribed or permitted by such authorities.

As determined on a U.S. statutory accounting basis,
    Aflac’s net income was $1.8 billion in 2007,
    $1.7 billion in 2006 and $1.3 billion in 2005. Capital
    and surplus was $4.2 billion at both December 31, 2007 and
    2006.

Net assets of the insurance subsidiaries aggregated
    $9.1 billion at December 31, 2007, on a GAAP basis,
    compared with $9.3 billion a year ago. Aflac Japan
    accounted for $6.0 billion, or 66.8%, of these net assets,
    compared with $5.7 billion, or 62.0%, at December 31,
    2006.

Reconciliations of Aflac’s net assets on a GAAP basis to
    capital and surplus determined on a U.S. statutory
    accounting basis as of December 31 were as follows:

Aflac Japan must report its results of operations and financial
    position to the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) on a
    Japanese regulatory accounting basis as prescribed by the FSA.
    Capital and surplus (unaudited) of Aflac Japan, based on
    Japanese regulatory accounting practices, aggregated
    $2.5 billion at December 31, 2007, and
    $2.6 billion at December 31, 2006. Japanese regulatory
    accounting practices differ in many respects from
    U.S. GAAP. Under Japanese regulatory accounting practices,
    policy acquisition costs are charged off immediately; deferred
    income tax liabilities are recognized on a different basis;
    policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are
    different; the carrying value of securities transferred to held
    to maturity is different; policyholder protection corporation
    obligations are not accrued; and premium income is recognized on
    a cash basis.

The Parent Company depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow,
    primarily in the form of dividends and management fees.
    Consolidated retained earnings in the accompanying financial
    statements largely represent the undistributed earnings of our
    insurance subsidiary. Amounts available for dividends,
    management fees and other payments to the Parent Company by its
    insurance subsidiary

II-92


may fluctuate due to different accounting methods required by
    regulatory authorities. These payments are also subject to
    various regulatory restrictions and approvals related to
    safeguarding the interests of insurance policyholders. Our
    insurance subsidiary must maintain adequate risk-based capital
    for U.S. regulatory authorities and our Japan branch must
    maintain adequate solvency margins for Japanese regulatory
    authorities. Additionally, the maximum amount of dividends that
    can be paid to the Parent Company by Aflac without prior
    approval of Nebraska’s director of insurance is the greater
    of the net gain from operations, which excludes net realized
    investment gains, for the previous year determined under
    statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and
    surplus as of the previous year-end. Dividends declared by Aflac
    during 2008 in excess of $1.7 billion would require such
    approval. Dividends declared by Aflac during 2007 were
    $1.4 billion.

A portion of Aflac Japan earnings, as determined on a Japanese
    regulatory accounting basis, can be repatriated each year to
    Aflac U.S. after complying with solvency margin provisions
    and satisfying various conditions imposed by Japanese regulatory
    authorities for protecting policyholders. Profit repatriations
    to the United States can fluctuate due to changes in the amounts
    of Japanese regulatory earnings. Among other items, factors
    affecting regulatory earnings include Japanese regulatory
    accounting practices and fluctuations in currency translation of
    Aflac Japan’s dollar-denominated investments and related
    investment income into yen. Profits repatriated by Aflac Japan
    to Aflac U.S. were as follows for the years ended

BENEFIT
    PLANS

Our basic employee defined-benefit pension plans cover
    substantially all of our full-time employees in the United
    States and Japan. At December 31, 2007, other liabilities
    included a liability for both plans in the amount of
    $82 million, compared with $102 million a year ago. We
    plan to make contributions of $20 million to the
    U.S. plan and $12 million to the Japanese plan in 2008.

On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and
    disclosure provisions and early adopted the measurement date
    provisions of SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires the
    recognition of the funded status (i.e., the difference between
    the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit
    obligations) of our benefit plans in our financial statements,
    with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other
    comprehensive income, net of tax. The adjustment to accumulated
    other comprehensive income at adoption represents the net
    unrecognized actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs
    or credits, as applicable, and the unrecognized transition asset
    remaining from the initial adoption of SFAS 87, all of
    which were previously netted against the plan’s funded
    status in the past under the provisions of SFAS 87. These
    amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension
    cost over future periods consistent with our historical
    accounting policy for amortizing such amounts. Further, the
    components of the benefit obligations that arise in subsequent
    periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension cost in
    the same periods are recognized as a component of other
    comprehensive income. Those amounts will also be subsequently
    recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost as
    previously described. The adoption of SFAS 158 had no
    effect on our net earnings for any period presented, and it will
    not affect our operating results in future periods.

No prior service costs or credits arose during 2007 and the

    ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Amortization of actuarial
    losses to expense in 2008 is estimated to be $1 million for
    the Japanese plan and $2 million for the U.S. plan,
    while the amortization of prior service costs and credits are
    expected to be negligible.

    Target asset allocations for U.S. plan assets are 60% to
    65% equity securities, 35% to 40% fixed-income securities and 0%
    to 3% cash and cash equivalents. Target asset allocations for
    Japanese plan assets are 34% equity securities and 66%
    fixed-income securities. As discussed below, the investment
    strategy of our pension plans is long-term in nature.

II-95


The investment objective of our U.S. and Japanese plans is
    to preserve the purchasing power of the plan’s assets and
    earn a reasonable inflation adjusted rate of return over the
    long term. Furthermore, we seek to accomplish these objectives
    in a manner that allows for the adequate funding of plan
    benefits and expenses. In order to achieve these objectives, our
    goal is to maintain a conservative, well-diversified and
    balanced portfolio of high-quality equity, fixed-income and
    money market securities. As a part of our strategy, we have
    established strict policies covering quality, type and
    concentration of investment securities. For our U.S. plan,
    these policies prohibit investments in precious metals, limited
    partnerships, venture capital, and direct investments in real
    estate. We are also prohibited from trading on margin. For our
    Japanese plan, these policies include limitations on investments
    in derivatives including futures, options and swaps, and
    low-liquidity investments such as real estate, venture capital
    investments, and privately issued securities.

We monitor the U.S. plan’s performance over a three-
    to five-year period utilizing shorter time frame performance
    measures to identify trends. We review investment performance
    and compliance with stated investment policies and practices on
    a quarterly basis. The specific investment objectives for the
    U.S. pension plan are: to exceed a composite of asset class
    target returns, weighted according to the plan’s target
    asset allocation; and to outperform the median fund from a
    universe of similarly managed corporate pension funds. Both
    objectives are measured over a rolling three- to five-year
    period. We monitor the Japanese plan’s asset allocation and
    compliance with stated investment policies and practices. The
    Japanese plan’s performance is reviewed on a quarterly
    basis by asset allocation. The specific investment objective for
    the Japanese plan is to outperform the projected long-term rate
    of return used to determine the Japanese plan’s pension
    obligation.

Expected future benefit payments for the U.S. and Japanese
    plans are as follows:

In Japan, participant salary and future salary increases are not
    factors in determining pension benefit cost or the related
    pension benefit obligation.

We base the long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets on
    the historical rates of return over the last 15 years and
    the expectation of similar returns over the long-term investment
    goals and objectives of U.S. plan assets. We base the
    long-term rate of return on the Japanese plan assets on the
    historical rates of return over the last 10 years.

In addition to the benefit obligations for funded employee
    plans, we also maintain unfunded supplemental retirement plans
    for certain officers and beneficiaries. Retirement expense for
    these unfunded supplemental plans was $5 million in 2007,
    $16 million in 2006 and $20 million in 2005. The
    accrued retirement liability for the unfunded supplemental
    retirement plans was $204 million at December 31,
    2007, compared with $209 million a year ago. The
    assumptions used in the valuation of these plans were the same
    as for the funded plans.

Stock Bonus Plan:

Aflac U.S. maintains a stock
    bonus plan for eligible U.S. sales associates. Plan
    participants receive shares of Aflac Incorporated common stock
    based on their new annualized premium sales and their first-year
    persistency of substantially all new insurance policies. The
    cost of this plan, which is included in deferred policy
    acquisition costs, amounted to $45 million in 2007,
    $40 million in 2006 and $37 million in 2005.

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

We have three outsourcing agreements with IBM. The first
    agreement provides mainframe computer operations and support for
    Aflac Japan. It has a remaining term of eight years and an
    aggregate remaining cost of 24.4 billion yen
    ($213 million using the December 31, 2007, exchange
    rate). The second agreement provides distributed computer
    operations and support for Aflac Japan. It has a remaining term
    of eight years and an aggregate remaining cost of
    30.4 billion yen ($266 million using the
    December 31, 2007, exchange rate). The third agreement
    provides application maintenance and development services for
    Aflac Japan. It has a remaining term of five years and an
    aggregate remaining cost of 8.8 billion yen
    ($77 million using the December 31, 2007, exchange
    rate).

We have entered into two additional outsourcing agreements to
    provide application maintenance and development services for our
    Japanese operation. The first agreement with Accenture has a
    remaining term of six years with an aggregate remaining cost of
    4.7 billion yen ($41 million using the
    December 31, 2007, exchange rate). The second agreement
    with NTT DATA has a remaining term of three years with an
    aggregate remaining cost of 1.0 billion yen
    ($9 million using the December 31, 2007, exchange
    rate).

We lease office space and equipment under agreements that expire
    in various years through 2022. Future minimum lease payments due
    under non-cancelable operating leases at December 31, 2007,
    were as follows:

In 2005, we announced a multiyear building project for
    additional office space in Columbus, Georgia. The initial phase
    was completed in 2007 at a cost of $27 million. The second
    phase of the expansion is to be completed in 2009 and is
    expected to cost approximately $48 million.

We are a defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the
    normal course of business. Members of our senior legal and
    financial management teams review litigation on a quarterly and
    annual basis. The final results of any litigation cannot be
    predicted with certainty. Although some of this litigation is
    pending in states where large punitive damages, bearing little
    relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs, have
    been awarded in recent years, we believe the outcome of pending
    litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

On February 4, 2008, we entered into an agreement for an
    accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program with an affiliate of
    Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
    (Merrill Lynch). Under the agreement, we purchased
    12.5 million shares of our outstanding common stock at
    $60.58 per share for a total purchase price of
    $757 million. The repurchase was funded with internal
    capital. The shares were acquired as a part of previously
    announced share repurchase authorizations by our board of
    directors and will be held in treasury. Under the agreement,
    Merrill Lynch plans to purchase shares of our common stock in
    the open market from time to time until it has acquired a number
    of shares equivalent to the number of shares we purchased from
    Merrill Lynch. At the end of this period, we may receive, or may
    be required to remit, a purchase price adjustment based upon the
    volume weighted average price of our common stock during the ASR
    program period. Under the terms of the ASR, we may elect to
    receive or pay any settlement amount in cash or shares of our
    common stock at our option. The completion and settlement of the
    ASR program is expected to occur during the second quarter of
    2008, although the settlement may occur before the second
    quarter at Merrill Lynch’s option.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES

The shareholders and board of directors of Aflac Incorporated:

Under date of February 28, 2008, we reported on the
    consolidated balance sheets of Aflac Incorporated and
    subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2007, and
    2006, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
    shareholders’ equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income
    for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2007, which are included herein. In connection
    with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial
    statements, we also audited the related financial statement
    schedules as listed in Item 15. These financial statement
    schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statement schedules based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the
    Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,

as of
    January 1, 2006. Additionally, as discussed in Notes 1
    and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
    adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
    Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),
