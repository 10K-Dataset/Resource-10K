General Description

Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) was incorporated in 1973 under the laws of the state of Georgia. Aflac Incorporated is a general business holding company and acts as a management company, overseeing the operations of its subsidiaries by providing management services and making capital available. Its principal business is supplemental health and life insurance, which is marketed and administered through its subsidiary, American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflac's policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Aflac U.S. markets and administers group products through Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC), branded as Aflac Group Insurance. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business.

Aflac offers voluntary insurance policies in Japan and the United States that provide a layer of financial protection against income and asset loss. We continue to diversify our product offerings in both Japan and the United States. Aflac Japan sells voluntary supplemental insurance products, including cancer plans, general medical indemnity plans, medical/sickness riders, care plans, living benefit life plans, ordinary life insurance plans and annuities. Aflac U.S. sells voluntary supplemental insurance products including products designed to protect individuals from depletion of assets (accident, cancer, critical illness/ care, hospital intensive care, hospital indemnity, fixed-benefit dental, and vision care plans) and loss-of-income products (life and short-term disability plans).

We are authorized to conduct insurance business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, several U.S. territories and Japan. Aflac Japan's revenues, including realized gains and losses on its investment portfolio, accounted for

Insurance Products - Japan

Aflac Japan's insurance products are designed to help consumers pay for medical and nonmedical costs that are not reimbursed under Japan's national health insurance system. Changes in Japan's economy and an aging population have put increasing pressure on Japan's national health care system. As a result, more costs are being shifted to Japanese


consumers, who in turn have become increasingly interested in insurance products that help them manage those costs. Aflac Japan has responded to this consumer need by enhancing existing products and developing new products.

Aflac Japan's product portfolio has expanded beyond traditional health-related products to include more life products. Some of the life products that we offer in Japan provide death benefits and cash surrender values. These products are available as stand-alone policies and riders. Some plans, such as our WAYS product, have features that allow policyholders to convert a portion of their life insurance to medical, nursing care, or fixed annuity benefits at a predetermined age. Our child endowment product offers a death benefit until a child reaches age 18. It also pays a lump-sum benefit at the time of the child's entry into high school, as well as an educational annuity for each of the four years during his or her college education. We believe that life insurance (first sector product) provides further opportunities for us to sell our cancer and medical insurance (third sector products) through cross-selling opportunities.

In early 2002, we introduced EVER, a stand-alone, whole-life medical product which offers a basic level of hospitalization coverage with an affordable premium. Since its initial introduction, we have expanded our suite of EVER product offerings to appeal to specific types of Japanese consumers and achieve greater market penetration. The most recent upgrade to our EVER product, released in June 2015, included riders to be associated with three critical illnesses (cancer, stroke and heart attack) to better respond to consumer’s needs for coverage of serious illnesses. These riders provide policyholders with a benefit upon the diagnosis for those three critical illnesses, waiver of premium payment thereafter and unlimited hospital days for such critical illnesses. Gentle EVER, our non-standard medical product, is designed to meet the needs of certain consumers who cannot qualify for our base EVER plan. An upgrade to our Gentle EVER product, released in July 2012, included expanded benefits and an attached advanced medical care rider.

We continue to believe that the entire medical category will remain an important part of our product portfolio in Japan.

Aflac pioneered the cancer insurance market in Japan in 1974, and we remain the number one provider of cancer insurance today. Over the years, we’ve customized our cancer product to respond to, and anticipate, the needs of our consumers and the advances in medical treatments. The cancer insurance plans we offer in Japan provide a lump-sum benefit upon initial diagnosis of internal cancer and benefits for treatment received due to internal cancer such as fixed daily benefits for hospitalization, outpatient services and convalescent care, and surgical and terminal care benefits. In September 2014, Aflac Japan introduced New Cancer DAYS, a new cancer product which provides enhanced coverage, including outpatient treatments and multiple cancer occurrence benefits. At the same time, premiums for this product have been lowered for most ages compared to prior plans. In October 2014, Aflac Japan introduced a unique Aflac-branded cancer product for Japan Post (see the Distribution - Japan and Regulation - Japan sections for background information). As the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan, we believe these products further strengthen our brand, and most importantly, provide valuable benefits to consumers who are looking for solutions to manage cancer-related costs. We are convinced that the affordable cancer products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio.

We also offer traditional fixed-income annuities and care policies. For additional information on Aflac Japan's products and composition of sales, see the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of MD&A in this report.

Insurance Products - U.S.

We design our U.S. insurance products to provide supplemental coverage for people who already have major medical or primary insurance coverage. Most of our U.S. policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Additionally, we started to market and administer group insurance products in 2009.

Our individually issued policies are portable and pay benefits regardless of other insurance. Most products' benefits are paid in cash directly to policyholders; therefore, our customers have the opportunity to use this cash to help with expenses of their choosing. Our individually issued health insurance plans are typically guaranteed-renewable for the lifetime of the policyholder (to age 75 for short-term disability policies). Our group insurance policies are underwritten on a group basis and often have some element of guaranteed issue.

Aflac U.S. offers accident coverage on both an individual and group basis. These policies are designed to protect against losses resulting from accidents. The accident portion of the policy includes lump-sum benefits for accidental death, dismemberment and specific injuries as well as fixed benefits for hospital confinement. In 2015

,

we introduced a new individual accident plan with new benefits for home modifications, improved wellness benefits and a new benefit that provides an additional payout for injuries related to participations in an organized sporting activity.


Aflac U.S. offers short-term disability benefits on both an individual and group basis. In 2013, we introduced a completely redesigned group short-term disability product with enhanced benefit options and higher income replacement amounts. In 2014, this group short-term disability product was introduced in additional states, formally completing the active launch of the product to the U.S. market.

Aflac U.S. offers coverage for critical illnesses on both an individual and group basis. These policies are designed to protect against losses resulting from critical illnesses such as heart attack, stroke, or cancer. On an individually underwritten basis we offer cancer plans, critical illness plans, and critical care and recovery plans (formerly called specified health event). On a group basis we offer critical illness plans. In 2015, an updated group critical illness plan was introduced that provides benefits for 30 additional conditions in addition to more consumer options.

Aflac U.S. offers hospital indemnity coverage on both an individual and group basis. Our hospital indemnity products provide policyholders fixed dollar benefits triggered by hospitalization due to accident or sickness, or just sickness alone. Indemnity benefits for inpatient and outpatient surgeries, as well as various other diagnostic events, are also available. We also offer a lump sum rider than can be added to our individual accident, short-term disability and hospital indemnity products. This rider may not be available on all products in all states. This rider provides a lump sum payment for a range of critical illness events including traumatic brain injury, Type 1 diabetes, advanced Alzheimer’s disease and many more. In January 2016, a new group hospital indemnity plan was introduced that includes 11 new benefits, including telemedicine and health screening. This plan provides flexibility, allowing our clients to personalize their plan designs to complement the underlying medical coverage that is offered to employees.

Aflac U.S. also offers additional coverages to those listed above, including dental, vision and life policies. Aflac U.S. offers fixed-benefit dental coverage on both an individual and group basis. Aflac U.S. offers Vision Now

SM

, an individually issued policy which provides benefits for serious eye health conditions and loss of sight as well as coverage for corrective eye materials and exam benefits. Aflac U.S. also offers term and whole-life policies on both an individual and group basis.

For additional information on Aflac's U.S. products and composition of sales, see the Aflac U.S. Segment subsection of MD&A in this report.

Distribution - Japan

The traditional channels through which we have sold our products are independent corporate agencies, individual agencies and affiliated corporate agencies. The independent corporate agencies and individual agencies that sell our products give us better access to workers at a vast number of small businesses in Japan. Agents' activities are primarily focused on insurance sales, with customer service support provided by the Aflac Contact Center. Independent corporate agencies and individual agencies contributed

47.0%

of new annualized premium sales in


, compared with

46.1%

in


and

43.8%

in


. Affiliated corporate agencies are originally formed when companies establish subsidiary businesses to sell our insurance products to their employees as part of a benefit package, and then expand to sell our products to other parties such as suppliers and customers. These agencies help us reach employees at large worksites, and some of them are also successful in approaching customers outside their business groups.  Affiliated corporate agencies, which include Japan Post, contributed

35.4%

of new annualized premium sales in


, compared with

30.0%

in


and

23.1%

in


. During


, we recruited more than


new sales agencies. As of

December 31, 2015

, Aflac Japan was represented by approximately

13,100

sales agencies, with approximately

114,000

licensed sales associates employed by those agencies. We believe that new agencies will continue to be attracted to Aflac Japan's

competitive commissions, attractive products, superior customer service and strong brand image.

We have sold our products to employees of banks since our entry into Japan in 1974. However, December 2007 marked the first time it was permissible for banks to sell our type of insurance products to their customers. By the end of


, we had agreements with


banks, approximately

90%

of the total number of banks in Japan, to sell our products.  We believe we have more banks selling our supplemental health insurance products than any of our competitors. Japanese consumers rely on banks to provide traditional bank services, and also to provide insurance solutions and other services. We believe our long-standing and strong relationships within the Japanese banking sector, along with our strategic preparations, have proven to be an advantage, particularly starting when this channel opened up for our products. Our partnerships throughout the banking sector provide us with a wider demographic of potential customers than we would otherwise have been able to reach, and it also allows banks to expand their product and service offerings to consumers. Banks contributed

14.9%

of Aflac Japan new annualized premium sales in


, compared with

21.5%

in


and

31.3%

in


.

Aflac Japan and Japan Post Holdings entered into a new agreement in July 2013, further expanding a partnership


that was established in 2008 (see Regulation-Japan). At the end of June 2014, Japan Post Insurance (Kampo) received Financial Services Agency (FSA) regulatory approval to enter into an agency contract with Aflac Japan to begin distributing Aflac Japan's cancer insurance products at all of Kampo's 79 directly managed sales offices. Aflac Japan has developed a unique Aflac-branded cancer product for Japan Post and Kampo that was introduced on October 1, 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the number of postal outlets selling our cancer products expanded to approximately 10,000, and starting July 1, 2015, Japan Post expanded the number of post offices that offer Aflac's cancer products to more than 20,000 postal outlets. We believe this alliance with Japan Post will further benefit our cancer insurance sales.

For additional information on Aflac Japan's distribution, see the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of MD&A in this report.

Distribution - U.S.

As of December 31,


, our U.S. sales force was composed of sales associates and brokers who are licensed to sell accident and health insurance. Many are also licensed to sell life insurance.

Sales associates and brokers are independent contractors and are paid commissions based on first-year and renewal premiums from their sales of insurance products. In addition to receiving commissions on personal production, district and regional sales coordinators may also receive override commissions and incentive bonuses.

Beginning in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2014, Aflac U.S. implemented tactical initiatives centered around providing competitive compensation to our sales hierarchy and positioning us to more effectively and consistently execute on the U.S. sales strategy across all states. These measures were designed to more effectively link sales management's success to Aflac's success. For example, we enhanced compensation through an incentive bonus for the first level of our sales management, district sales coordinators, who are primarily responsible for selling Aflac products and training new sales associates. Additionally, we eliminated the commission-based position of state sales coordinator. To better manage our state operations, we introduced the new position of market director, effective October 1, 2014. Market directors are salaried with the opportunity to earn sales-related bonuses. We believe these changes have enhanced and will continue to enhance performance management and better align compensation with new business results.

We concentrate on marketing our insurance products at the worksite. This method offers policies to individuals through employment, trade and other associations. Historically, our policies have been individually underwritten with premiums generally paid by the employee. Additionally, Aflac's individual policies are portable, meaning that individuals may retain their full insurance coverage upon separation from employment or such affiliation, generally at the same premium. We collect a major portion of premiums on such sales through payroll deduction or other forms of centralized billing. With our brokerage sales expansion and CAIC, branded as Aflac Group Insurance, we offer group voluntary insurance products desired by many large employers. These products are sold on a group basis and often have some element of guaranteed issue. Worksite marketing enables sales associates and brokers to reach a greater number of prospective policyholders and lowers distribution costs, compared with individually marketed business.

Aflac U.S. utilizes dual-channel distribution to market our insurance products to businesses of all sizes. Our career agent channel focuses on marketing Aflac to the small business market, which consists of employers with less than 100 employees. As such, we have aligned our recruiting, training, compensation, marketing and incentives for our career agents to encourage specific activity and sales of individual policies in this market. Our newest channel is the broker channel, which is a sales division of Aflac Group. The broker channel focuses on selling to the mid- and large-case market, which is comprised of employers with more than 100 employees and typically an average size of 1,000 employees or more. Since regional and national brokers have traditionally served the mid- and large-case market, the highly trained and experienced sales professionals of the broker channel are assigned a geographic market to strengthen relationships with the top brokers and sell Aflac products to their clients. As a result, we are represented on more than 80 benefit administration platforms, sometimes referred to as exchanges, of various brokers.

For additional information on Aflac's U.S. distribution, see the Aflac U.S. Segment subsection of MD&A in this report.


Competition - Japan

In 1974, Aflac was granted an operating license to sell life insurance in Japan, making Aflac the second non-Japanese life insurance company to gain direct access to the Japanese insurance market. Through 1981, we faced limited competition for cancer insurance policy sales. However, Japan has experienced two periods of deregulation since we entered the market. The first came in the early 1980s, when nine mid-sized insurers, including domestic and foreign companies, were allowed to sell cancer insurance products for the first time. The second period began in 2001 when all life and non-life insurers were allowed to sell stand-alone cancer and medical insurance products as well as other stand-alone health insurance products. As a result, the number of insurance companies offering stand-alone cancer and medical insurance has more than doubled since the market was deregulated in 2001. However, based on our growth of annualized premiums in force and agencies, we do not believe that our market-leading position has been significantly impacted by increased competition. Furthermore, we believe the continued development and maintenance of operating efficiencies will allow us to offer affordable products that appeal to consumers. Aflac is the largest life insurer in Japan in terms of cancer and medical policies in force. As of

December 31, 2015

, we exceeded

23 million

individual policies in force in Japan.

Aflac has had substantial success selling cancer policies in Japan, with more than

14 million

cancer policies in force as of

December 31, 2015

. Aflac continued to be the number one seller of cancer insurance policies in Japan throughout


. We believe we will remain a leading provider of cancer insurance coverage in Japan, principally due to our experience in the market, low-cost operations, expansive marketing system (see Distribution - Japan above) and product expertise.

We have also experienced substantial success selling medical insurance in Japan. While other companies have recognized the opportunities that we have seen in the medical insurance market and offered new products, we endeavor to make our products stand out for their value to consumers.

In addition to third sector products, Aflac Japan sells life insurance products such as WAYS (described in the Products section of this report). The market for ordinary life products of this kind is highly competitive. We will continue to pursue the development and marketing of specialty products that meet specific needs within the general life insurance market.

Competition - U.S.

Aflac competes against several voluntary supplemental insurance carriers on a national and regional basis. We believe our policies, premium rates, and sales commissions are competitive by product type. Moreover, we believe that  Aflac products are distinct from competitive offerings given our product focus (including features, benefits, and our claims service model), distribution capabilities, and brand awareness. For many companies with which we compete, voluntary supplemental insurance products are sold as a secondary business. A growing number of major medical and life insurance carriers are also entering into the voluntary supplemental insurance market. For Aflac, supplemental insurance products are our primary business and are sold via a large distribution network of independent sales associates and brokers (see Distribution - U.S. above). Aflac's advertising campaigns have increased our name awareness and understanding by consumers and businesses of the value our products provide.

Both private and publicly-traded insurers offer major medical insurance for hospitalization and medical expenses. Much of this insurance is sold on a group basis to accounts that are both fully and self-insured. The federal and state governments also pay substantial costs of medical treatment through various programs. Major medical insurance generally covers a substantial portion of the medical expenses incurred by an insured. Aflac policies are designed to provide coverage that supplements major medical insurance by paying cash directly to the policyholder to use for expenses their major medical insurance is not designed to cover. Thus, we do not compete directly with major medical insurers except those who sell supplemental insurance products as a secondary business. Any reduction of coverage, increase in employee participation costs, or increased deductibles and copayments by major medical commercial or government insurance carriers could favorably affect our business opportunities. Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), some employers have shifted a larger burden of the cost of care to their employees, primarily through increases in premiums, copays, and/or deductibles. Since Aflac products provide an additional level of financial protection for policyholders, we believe the increased financial exposure some employees may face creates a favorable opportunity for our products. Further, given the profitability erosion some major medical carriers are facing in their core lines of business, we have seen a more competitive landscape as they seek entry into Aflac's supplemental product segments in an effort to offset this impact.

One Day Pay

SM

is a claims initiative that we have introduced at Aflac U.S. to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just one day. We believe that along with our brand and relevant products, this claims practice has helped Aflac stand out from competitors.


Investments and Investment Results

Net investment income was

$3.1 billion

in


and

$3.3 billion

in both


and


. The decrease in the reported net investment income in U.S. dollar terms for 2015 was primarily due to a weakening of the weighted-average yen/dollar exchange rate when compared to previous periods. In addition, a reduction in investable cash flows and lower investment yields for new purchases in both Japan and the United States have hampered the growth rate of net investment income. In 2015, we continued to address the challenge of investing in this low-interest-rate environment by increasing our allocation to higher yielding asset classes, while still adhering to our strategic asset allocation. For further information on our investments and investment results, see the Insurance Operations and Analysis of Financial Condition sections of MD&A and Notes 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Regulation - Japan

The financial and business affairs of Aflac Japan are subject to examination by Japan's FSA. Aflac Japan files annual reports and financial statements for the Japanese insurance operations based on a March 31 fiscal year end, prepared in accordance with Japanese regulatory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the FSA. Japanese regulatory basis earnings are determined using accounting principles that differ materially from U.S. GAAP. For example, under Japanese regulatory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are expensed immediately; policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are different; premium income is recognized on a cash basis; different consolidation criteria apply to variable interest entities (VIEs); different accounting applies to reinsurance; and investments can have a separate accounting classification and treatment referred to as policy reserve matching bonds (PRM). Capital and surplus of Aflac Japan, based on Japanese regulatory accounting practices, was

$4.7 billion

at

December 31, 2015

, compared with

$5.6 billion

at

December 31, 2014

.

The FSA maintains a solvency standard, which is used by Japanese regulators to monitor the financial strength of insurance companies. As of

December 31, 2015

, Aflac Japan's solvency margin ratio (SMR) was

828%

, compared with

857%

at

December 31, 2014

. Aflac Japan's SMR is sensitive to interest rate, credit spread and foreign exchange rate changes. See the Capital Resources and Liquidity Section of MD&A for a discussion of measures we have taken to mitigate the sensitivity of Aflac Japan's SMR.

We typically repatriate a portion of Aflac Japan's accumulated earnings, as determined on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis, to Aflac U.S. provided that Aflac Japan has adequately protected policyholders' interests as measured by its SMR. The FSA may not allow profit repatriations to Aflac U.S. if the transfers would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of Japanese policyholders. In the near term, we do not expect these requirements to adversely affect the funds available for profit repatriations, nor do we expect these requirements to adversely affect the funds available for payments of allocated expenses to Aflac U.S. and management fees to the Parent Company.

In 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing Japan's postal system (Japan Post) was enacted into law. The privatization laws split Japan Post into four operating entities that began operating in October 2007. In 2007, one of these entities selected Aflac Japan as its provider of cancer insurance to be sold through its post offices, and, in 2008, we began selling cancer insurance through these post offices. Japan Post has historically been a popular place for consumers to purchase insurance products. Legislation to reform the postal system passed the Diet in April 2012 and resulted in the merger of two of the postal operating entities (the one that delivers the mail and the one that runs the post offices) on October 1, 2012. In July 2013, Aflac Japan entered into a new agreement with Japan Post Holdings to further expand a partnership that was established in 2008. See the Distribution-Japan section for further developments in 2015.

The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. For additional information regarding the policyholder protection fund, see the Policyholder Protection subsection of MD&A in this report.

In June 2013, a revision to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act established a post-funded Orderly Resolution Regime for financial institutions to prevent a financial crisis in the event of a financial institution’s failure. This regime came into effect in March 2014 and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company's operations in Japan.

As a branch of our principal insurance subsidiary, Aflac Japan is also subject to regulation and supervision in the United States (see Regulation - U.S.). For additional information regarding Aflac Japan's operations and regulations, see


the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of MD&A and Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Regulation - U.S.

The Parent Company and its insurance subsidiaries, Aflac (a Nebraska-domiciled insurance company), American Family Life Assurance Company of New York (Aflac New York, a New York-domiciled insurance company) and CAIC (a South Carolina-domiciled insurance company) are subject to state regulations in the United States as an insurance holding company system. Such regulations generally provide that transactions between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable. In addition, transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries, and material transactions between companies within the system, including management fees, loans and advances are subject to prior notice to, or approval by, state regulatory authorities. These laws generally require, among other things, the insurance holding company and each insurance company directly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance departments of their respective domiciliary states and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system.

Like all U.S. insurance companies, Aflac is subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which it does business. In general, the insurance laws of the various jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to, among other things:

•

granting and revoking licenses to transact business

•

regulating trade and claims practices

•

licensing of insurance agents and brokers

•

approval of policy forms and premium rates

•

standards of solvency and maintenance of specified policy benefit reserves and minimum loss ratio requirements

•

capital requirements

•

limitations on dividends to shareholders

•

the nature of and limitations on investments

•

deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders

•

filing of financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory insurance accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities

periodic examinations of the market conduct, financial, and other affairs of insurance companies

The insurance laws of Nebraska that govern Aflac's activities provide that the acquisition or change of “control” of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the Nebraska Department of Insurance. A person seeking to acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domestic insurance company or of any person controlling a domestic insurance company (in the case of Aflac, the Parent Company) must generally file with the Nebraska Department of Insurance (NEDOI) an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy to Aflac. In Nebraska, control is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, acquires 10% or more of an insurance company or of any other person or entity controlling the insurance company. The 10% presumption is not conclusive and control may be found to exist at less than 10%. Similar laws apply in New York and South Carolina, the domiciliary jurisdictions of the Parent Company's other insurance subsidiaries, Aflac New York and CAIC.

State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). In 2013, the Nebraska insurance regulator, along with the New York insurance regulator, completed a coordinated risk-focused full scope financial examination for the four-year period and three-year period, respectively, ended December 31, 2011 for Aflac and Aflac New York as part of the normal examination process. These examinations found no material deficiencies. Also, in 2011 the South Carolina insurance regulator completed a risk-focused full scope financial examination for the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 for CAIC as part of the normal examination process and found no material deficiencies. In 2016, the Nebraska and New York insurance regulators will commence a routine examination of the four-year period ended December 31, 2015, and the South Carolina insurance regulator will commence a routine examination of the five-year period ended December 31, 2015.


The NAIC continually reviews regulatory matters

,

such as risk-based capital (RBC) modernization (Operational Risk and C-1 Investment Risk) and principles-based reserving, and recommends changes and revisions for adoption by state legislators and insurance departments. The NAIC uses a risk-based capital formula relating to insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk to facilitate identification by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mix of risk inherent in the insurer's operations. The formulas for determining the amount of risk-based capital specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company's regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level risk-based capital as defined by the NAIC. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The levels are company action, regulatory action, authorized control, and mandatory control. Aflac's NAIC risk-based capital ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position. As of

December 31, 2015

, based on year-end statutory accounting results, Aflac's company action level RBC ratio was

933%

Federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including health care reform legislation, financial services reform legislation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation, can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. Various forms of federal oversight and regulation of insurance have been passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by the president. For example, the ACA, federal health care reform legislation, gives the U.S. federal government direct regulatory authority over the business of health insurance. The reform includes major changes to the U.S. health care insurance marketplace. Among other changes, the reform legislation includes an individual medical insurance coverage mandate, provides for penalties on certain employers for failing to provide adequate coverage, creates health insurance exchanges, and addresses coverage and exclusions as well as medical loss ratios. The legislation also includes changes in government reimbursements and tax credits for individuals and employers and alters federal and state regulation of health insurers. These changes, directed toward major medical health insurance coverage which Aflac does not offer, will continue to be implemented over the next several years. While the ACA was enacted in 2010, the major elements of the law became effective on January 1, 2014. We believe that the ACA, as enacted, does not materially affect the design of our insurance products. However, indirect consequences of the legislation and regulations could present challenges and/or opportunities that could potentially have an impact on our sales model, financial condition and results of operations.

On December 18, 2015, the president signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act which included a revision to delay implementation of the Excise Tax on High Cost Plans, better known as the "Cadillac tax.” This tax was originally scheduled to begin in 2017, was previously delayed until 2018, and is now scheduled to begin in 2020. The tax consists of 40% of the cost of employer sponsored health coverage in excess of certain dollar thresholds. In general, only Aflac specified disease and fixed indemnity (i.e. supplemental health) products offered on a pre-tax basis are taken into account under this tax.

The legislation also makes the tax deductible by the payer. If employers fund coverage on a pre-tax basis, Aflac, as the insurer, would be liable for its pro-rata share of any tax on excess coverage, determined based on the cost of Aflac coverage compared to the total cost of the applicable health coverage in which each employee is enrolled. Making the tax deductible would then reduce the economic impact of any tax that is imposed and payable by Aflac.

Many employers are concerned about the tax and what impact it will have on benefit offerings in the future. There is confusion in the market about how the tax is calculated and who pays the tax, presenting a risk that some employers will mistakenly conclude that

all supplemental health products are included in the calculation for the tax regardless of pre-tax funding status or whether an employer’s health coverage exceeds the trigger for the tax. Some employers may decide simply to drop coverage of affected supplemental health products, rather than convert it to an after-tax basis. During this extended implementation period, Aflac will be assessing the impact of this tax; educating employers about the tax; and investigating ways to mitigate the impact of the tax. Having employees pay for the coverage on an after-tax basis would exempt affected supplemental health products from the tax.

In 2010, the president signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly known as the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, created a Financial Stability Oversight Council (the Council). In April 2012, the Council released a final rule describing the general process it will follow in determining whether to designate a nonbank financial company for supervision by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (the Board). The Council may designate by a two-thirds vote whether certain nonbank financial companies, including certain insurance companies and insurance holding companies, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States, in which case such nonbank financial companies would become subject to prudential regulation by the Board. On April 3, 2013, the Board published a final rule that establishes the requirements for determining when a nonbank financial company is "predominantly engaged in financial activities" - a prerequisite for designation by the Council. Prudential regulation by the Board includes supervision of capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements and


examinations. The Board may limit such company’s ability to enter into mergers, acquisitions and other business combination transactions, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate one or more activities, or impose conditions on the manner in which it conducts activities. The Council designated two insurers in 2013 and an additional insurer in 2014 as a Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI). On December 18, 2014, the president signed the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act into law. This legislation clarifies the Board’s authority to apply insurance-based capital standards for insurance companies subject to federal supervision. Although Aflac is a nonbank financial company predominantly engaged in financial activities as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, we do not believe Aflac will be considered a company that poses a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations issued thereunder may have an impact on Aflac's derivative activity, including activity on behalf of Aflac Japan, in particular rules to require central clearing and collateral for certain types of derivatives. In 2014, the five U.S. banking regulators and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)  re-proposed for comment their rules regarding collateral for uncleared swaps. Final rules were issued by the five U.S. banking regulators on October 22, 2015 and by the CFTC on December 16, 2015. Such rules may result in increased collateral requirements or affect other aspects of Aflac's derivatives activity.

The Dodd-Frank Act also established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) under the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care

insurance and crop insurance. Traditionally, U.S. insurance companies have been regulated primarily by state insurance departments. In December 2013, the FIO released a report entitled "How To Modernize And Improve The System Of Insurance Regulation In The United States." The report was required by the Dodd-Frank Act, and included 18 recommended areas of near-term reform for the states, including addressing capital adequacy and safety/soundness issues, reform of insurer resolution practices, and reform of marketplace regulation. The report also listed nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation. Some of the recommendations outlined in the FIO report released in December 2013 have been implemented. Of the nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation that are applicable to Aflac, the president has signed the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act into law in January 2015, which simplifies the agent and broker licensing process across state lines. The FIO has also engaged with the supervisory colleges to monitor financial stability and identify regulatory gaps for large national and internationally active insurers.

The process of implementing the Dodd-Frank Act is ongoing and continues to involve additional rulemaking from time to time. At the current time, it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty what impact, if any, the Dodd-Frank Act will have on our U.S. business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Since September 2013, the NEDOI has chaired Aflac’s Supervisory College which was established consistent with international regulatory standards and supervisory best practices as a forum for cooperation and communication between the Company's primary supervisors. Japan's Financial Services Agency attends Aflac’s Supervisory College. Three Supervisory Colleges have taken place since its establishment and the regulators have agreed to continue this process.

Under state insurance guaranty association laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions, we are subject to assessments, based on the share of business we write in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. In the United States, some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. The Company's policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domicile's statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium upon which the assessment is based is written. In most states, the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction. For additional information regarding state insurance guaranty assessments, see the U.S. Regulatory Environment subsection of MD&A in this report.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

We face a wide range of risks, and our continued success depends on our ability to identify, prioritize and appropriately manage our enterprise risk exposures. Readers should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Form 10-K. These risks and other factors may affect forward-looking statements, including those in this document or made by the Company elsewhere, such as in earnings release webcasts, investor conference presentations or press releases. The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, there could be a material impact on the Company.

Difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy could have a material adverse effect on our investments, capital position, revenue, profitability, and liquidity and harm our business.

Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the global economy generally, including in our two primary operating markets of the United States and Japan. Weak global financial markets impact the value of our existing investment portfolio, influence opportunities for new investments, and may contribute to generally weak economic fundamentals, which can have a negative impact on our operating activities.

In recent years, global capital markets have been severely impacted by several major events. The financial crisis that began in the latter part of 2008 saw dramatic declines in investment values and weak economic conditions as the global financial system came under extreme pressure. Although U.S. markets began recovering in late 2009 and 2010, Europe continued to struggle under a severely weakened banking system and investor concerns with sovereign debt levels. Following a period of unprecedented intervention by governments and central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank (ECB), financial conditions improved from the dire conditions of the global financial crisis, global recession, and European debt crisis. Recently, global markets have experienced materially higher levels of market volatility due to concerns including changes in the market’s perception of global growth, additional ECB intervention, uncertainty surrounding Japan’s continued recovery amidst assorted policy changes, significant declines in global commodity prices including oil, divergent monetary policies in the United States versus many other developed economies, and heightened concerns surrounding the Chinese economy.

As we hold a significant amount of fixed maturity and perpetual securities issued by borrowers located in many different parts of the world, including a large portion issued by banks and financial institutions, sovereigns, and other corporate borrowers in the U.S. and Europe, our financial results are directly influenced by global financial markets. A retrenchment of the recent improvements in overall capital market health could adversely affect our financial condition, including our capital position and our overall profitability. Market volatility and recessionary pressures could result in significant realized or unrealized losses due to severe price declines driven by increases in interest rates or credit spreads, defaults in payment of principal or interest, or credit rating downgrades.

Following the election of Shinzo Abe as Prime Minister of Japan in December 2012, the new administration adopted a new set of financial measures to stimulate the Japanese economy, most recently imposing negative interest rates on excess bank reserves. In a December 2014 snap-election, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won a landslide victory, further strengthening Mr. Abe's ability to implement economic reform and address key policy challenges. The Japanese financial markets have reacted with even lower rates on Japanese Government bonds, large increases in Japanese equity market values, and a weakening of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar, a situation that remains largely intact today.

Japan is the largest market for our products and we own substantial holdings in Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs). Government actions to stimulate the economy affect the value of our existing holdings, our reinvestment rate on new investments in JGBs or other yen denominated assets, and consumer behavior relative to our suite of products. The additional government debt from fiscal stimulus actions could contribute to a weakening of the Japan sovereign credit profile and result in further rating downgrades at the credit rating agencies. This could lead to additional volatility in Japanese capital and currency markets.

Our investment portfolio owns sizeable credit positions in many other geographic areas of the world including the Middle East, Latin America, Asia, and other emerging markets. Deterioration in their underlying economies, sovereign credit worthiness, or financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial position. We also own credit investments that result in exposure to commodity valuations, including oil, natural gas, gold, and other metals.  The recent


significant declines in the prices of these commodities could result in credit deterioration of our holdings and significant credit losses due to depressed bond valuations, defaults in payment of principal or interest, or credit rating downgrades.

Most of our investment portfolio holdings are income-producing bonds that provide a fixed level of income. Many of our investments were made at the relatively low level of interest rates prevailing the last several years. Any increase in the market yields of our holdings due to an increase in interest rates could create substantial unrealized losses in our portfolio, as discussed further in a separate risk factor in this section of the Form 10-K.

We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, dividends on our common stock, interest on our debt and liabilities. For a further description of our liquidity needs, including maturing indebtedness, see Item 7 of this Form 10-K - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity. In the event our current resources do not meet our needs, we may need to seek additional financing. Our access to additional funding will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit to the financial services industry and our credit rating. We have a credit facility agreement as a capital contingency plan with a syndicate of financial institutions that provides for borrowings in the amount of

55 billion

yen. This agreement provides for borrowings in Japanese yen or the equivalent of Japanese yen in U.S. dollars on a revolving basis and will expire on the earlier of September 18, 2020, or the date the commitments are terminated pursuant to an event of default, as such term is defined in the credit agreement.

As a part of our capital contingency plan, we entered into a committed reinsurance facility agreement on December 1, 2015 in the amount of approximately 110 billion yen. This reinsurance facility agreement is effective from December 1, 2015 until December 31, 2016. There are also additional commitment periods of a one-year duration each which are automatically extended unless notification is received from the reinsurer within 60 days prior to the expiration. The reinsurer can withdraw from the committed facility if Aflac‘s Standard and Poor's (S&P) rating drops below BBB-. As of December 31, 2015, we have not executed a reinsurance treaty under this committed reinsurance facility.

Should investors become concerned with any of our investment holdings, including the concentration in JGBs, our access to market sources of funding could be negatively impacted. There is a possibility that lenders or debt investors may also become concerned if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn or there are further adverse economic trends in the United States or Japan, specifically, or generally in developed markets. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. See more information on recent rating actions later in this Risk Factors section.

Broad economic factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, indirectly, the amount and profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. This adverse effect could be particularly significant for companies such as ours that distribute supplemental, discretionary insurance products primarily through the worksite in the event that economic conditions result in a decrease in the number of new hires and total employees. Adverse changes in the economy could potentially lead our customers to be less inclined to purchase supplemental insurance coverage or to decide to cancel or modify existing insurance coverage, which could adversely affect our premium revenue, results of operations and financial condition. We are unable to predict the course of the current recoveries in global financial markets or the recurrence, duration or severity of disruptions in such markets.

The effect that governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will have on such markets generally, or on us specifically, is difficult to determine at this time.

In response to the severity of the global financial crisis, numerous regulatory and governmental actions were taken to address weakness in the banking system, volatility in capital market conditions, and to stimulate the global economy.  In the United States, this included aggressive expansionary monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve, including conventional measures such as reducing the Federal Funds rate to near zero, and less conventional measures such as multiple rounds of quantitative easing. The result of the actions of the Federal Reserve was to keep interest rates, as measured by the U.S. Treasury curve and other relevant market rates, at very low levels for an extended period of time in an attempt to stimulate the economy.

As the U.S. economy has continued to improve, the Federal Reserve has reduced the amount of monetary stimulus. The actions previously taken by the Federal Reserve, and the amounts involved, are unprecedented. As such, there exist considerable risks associated with the amount of monetary stimulus provided and its withdrawal. These risks could


include heightened inflation, increased volatility of interest rates, significantly higher interest rates, and overall increased volatility in the fair value of investment securities. These factors could negatively impact our business by reducing the value of our existing portfolio, negatively impacting our opportunities for new investments as market volatility increases, increasing the risk of depressed bond valuations or defaults in our credit portfolio, increasing the costs to hedge certain dollar holdings into yen, and reducing the demand for our products should the broader economy be negatively impacted by withdrawal of monetary stimulus.

The financial crisis also created new government regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Financial Regulatory Reform Bill for U.S. institutions. This significant legislation, intended to reduce risk of another crisis, contains multiple provisions that could impact our business as rules are finalized and implemented. This legislation could impact the value of our significant holdings in banks and other financial institutions and our ability to conduct financial and capital market transactions, negatively impact pricing and our general ability to conduct financial and capital market transactions, and affect the general competitiveness of the U.S. financial services industry.

As the effects of the financial crisis continue to linger, other central banks around the world have followed the actions of the Federal Reserve and taken unprecedented actions. In the case of the ECB, multiple actions were taken to mitigate the European sovereign and banking crisis, and to stimulate the economies throughout the Eurozone. The Bank of Japan has undertaken monetary policy actions designed to stimulate the Japanese economy. These governmental interventions are still being deployed in the form of extremely low short-term interest rates and asset purchases, and thus may continue to support an environment of historically low or negative interest rates in the near to medium term. There can be no assurance as to the effect that these governmental actions, other governmental actions taken in the future, or the ceasing of these governmental actions will have on the financial markets generally, the economies in which we operate, our competitive position, or our business and financial condition.

Defaults, downgrades, widening credit spreads or other events impairing the value of the fixed maturity securities and perpetual securities in our investment portfolio may reduce our earnings and capital position.

We are subject to the risk that the issuers and/or guarantors of fixed maturity securities and perpetual securities we own may default on principal or interest. A significant portion of our portfolio represents an unsecured obligation of the issuer, including some that are subordinated to other debt in the issuer’s capital structure. In these cases, many factors can influence the overall creditworthiness of the issuer and ultimately its ability to service and repay our holdings. This can include changes in the global economy, the company's assets, strategy, or management, shifts in the dynamics of the industries in which they compete, their access to additional funding, and the overall health of the credit markets. Factors unique to our securities including contractual protections such as financial covenants or relative position in the issuer's capital structure also influence the value of our holdings.

Most of our holdings carry a rating by one or more of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs, or “rating agencies”). Any change in the rating agencies' approach to evaluating credit and assigning an opinion could negatively impact the fair value of our portfolio. We employ a team of credit analysts to monitor the creditworthiness of the issuers in our portfolio. Any credit-related declines in the fair value of positions held in our portfolio we believe are not temporary in nature will negatively impact our net income and capital position through impairment and other credit related losses, which would also affect our solvency ratios in the United States and Japan. For regulatory accounting purposes for Aflac Japan, there are certain requirements for realizing impairments that could be triggered by credit-related losses, which may be different from U.S. GAAP and statutory requirements, which could negatively impact Aflac Japan's earnings, and the corresponding repatriation and capital deployment.

We are also subject to the risk that any collateral providing credit enhancement to our positions could deteriorate. These instruments may include senior secured first lien loans, such as bank loans and middle market loans, and loan-backed securities where the underlying loan or collateral notes may default on principal, interest, or other payments, causing an adverse change in cash flows to the positions held in our investment portfolio.

Our portfolio includes holdings of perpetual securities. Most of these are issued by global banks and financial institutions. Following the financial crisis, rating agencies reviewed and, in most cases, modified the rating criteria for financial institutions. This has caused multiple downgrades of many bank and financial issuers, but perpetual securities have been more negatively impacted as their lower position in the capital structure represents relatively more risk than other more senior obligations of the issuer. Further downgrades or default of issuers of securities we own will have a negative impact on our portfolio and could reduce our earnings and capital.


We are exposed to sovereign credit risk through instruments issued directly by governments and government entities as well as banks and other institutions that rely in part on the strength of the underlying government for their credit quality. In addition to the United States and Japan, many governments, especially in Europe, have been subject to rating downgrades due to the need for fiscal and budgetary remediation and structural reforms, reduced economic activity, and investment needed to support banks or other systematically important entities. Additional downgrades or default of our sovereign issuers will have a negative impact on our portfolio and could reduce our earnings and capital.

In addition to our exposure to the underlying fundamental credit strength of the issuers of our fixed maturity and perpetual securities and the underlying risk of default, we are also exposed to the general movement in credit market spreads. A widening of credit spreads could reduce the value of our existing portfolio, create unrealized losses on our investment portfolio, and reduce our adjusted capital position which is used in determining the Solvency Margin Ratio (SMR) in Japan. This could, however, increase the net investment income on new credit investments. Conversely, a tightening of credit spreads could increase the value of our existing portfolio and create unrealized gains on our investment portfolio. This could reduce the net investment income available to us on new credit investments. Increased market volatility also makes it difficult to value certain of our investment holdings (see the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this Form 10-K).

As a result of the large decline in oil prices, there has been heightened attention to certain investments in the various energy sectors following a large increase in market volatility. Our portfolio includes holdings diversified across multiple sub-sectors of the oil and gas industry, spread among multiple geographies.

As of December 31, 2015, the weighted-average rating of our total fixed maturity energy exposure was BBB, and 93% of our exposure to the oil and gas industry was investment grade. Absent a major change in the outlook for oil prices, we expect the increase in market volatility surrounding these issuers to continue. This could lead to increased negative ratings activity from the public rating agencies for energy credit issuers. We do not currently expect our investments in the energy sector to have a material impact on our results of operations.

For more information regarding credit risk, see the Market Risks of Financial Instruments - Credit Risk subsection of Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this Form 10-K.

We are exposed to significant interest rate risk, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

We have substantial investment portfolios that support our policy liabilities. Low levels of interest rates on investments, especially those currently being experienced in Japan and the United States, have reduced the level of investment income earned by the Company. Our overall level of investment income will be negatively impacted if a low-interest-rate environment persists. While we generally seek to maintain a diversified portfolio of fixed-income investments that reflects the cash flow and duration characteristics of the liabilities it supports, we may not be able to fully mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities. Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the ability to invest future cash flows to support the interest rate assumption made at the time our products were priced and the related reserving assumptions were established. A sustained decline in interest rates could hinder our ability to earn the returns assumed in the pricing and the reserving for our products at the time they were sold and issued. Due to low interest rates, our ability to earn the returns we expect may also influence our ability to develop and price attractive new products and could impact our overall sales levels. Our first sector products are more interest rate sensitive than third sector products. The recent negative interest rate imposed by the Bank of Japan on excess bank reserves could have a negative impact on the distribution and pricing of these products.

A rise in interest rates could improve our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds that we reinvest. However, an increase in the differential of short-term U.S. and Japan interest rates would increase the cost of hedging our U.S. dollar-denominated assets into yen.

We also have exposure to interest rates related to the value of the substantial investment portfolios that support our policy liabilities. Changes in interest rates have a direct impact on the fair values of fixed securities in our investment portfolio; however, they do not have a direct impact on the related valuation of the corresponding liabilities. Prolonged periods of low interest rates, as have been experienced in recent years, heighten the risk of future increases in interest rates because of an increasing proportion of our investment portfolio includes investments that bear lower rates of return than the embedded book yield of the investment portfolio. A rise in interest rates could increase the net unrealized loss position of our debt and perpetual securities. Some of the insurance products that Aflac sells in the United States and Japan provide cash surrender values. A rise in interest rates could trigger significant policy lapsation which might require


the Company to sell investment assets and recognize unrealized losses. This situation is commonly referred to as disintermediation risk. Conversely, a decline in interest rates could decrease the net unrealized loss position of our debt and perpetual securities. While we generally invest our assets to match the duration and cash flow characteristics of our policy liabilities, and therefore would not expect to realize most of these gains or losses, our risk is that unforeseen events or economic conditions, such as changes in interest rates resulting from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control, reduce the effectiveness of this strategy and either cause us to dispose of some or all of these investments prior to their maturity, or increase the risk that the issuers of these securities may default or may require impairment, which could result in our having to recognize such gains or losses.

Rising interest rates also negatively impact the SMR since unrealized losses on the available-for-sale investment portfolio are included in the calculation. While we closely monitor the SMR and have taken steps to reduce the sensitivity of Aflac Japan's available-for-sale portfolio to increases in interest rates, there is no assurance that these measures will be fully effective, particularly for sharp increases in interest rates. For regulatory accounting purposes for Aflac Japan, there are certain requirements for realizing impairments that could be triggered by rising interest rates, negatively impacting Aflac Japan's earnings and corresponding repatriation and capital deployment.

We mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk by diversifying our portfolio to risk factors that may be expected to have negative correlation to interest rates, particularly in periods of heightened market volatility. These include equity, credit, and currency risk factors. However, interest rate risk is still an inherent portfolio, business and capital risk for us, and significant changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, changes in unrealized positions, and liquidity.

For more information regarding interest rate risk, see the Interest Rate Risk subsection within the Market Risks of Financial Instruments section of MD&A in this report.

Our concentration of business in Japan poses risks to our operations.

Our operations in Japan, including realized gains and losses on Aflac Japan's investment portfolio, accounted for

70%

of our total revenues for


, compared with 72% in


and 74% in


. The Japanese operations accounted for

83%

of our total assets at

December 31, 2015

, compared with 82% at

December 31, 2014

.

Further, because of the concentration of our business in Japan and our need for long-dated yen-denominated assets, we have a substantial concentration of JGBs in our investment portfolio. As such we have material exposure to the Japanese economy, geo-political climate, political regime, and other factors that generally determine a country's creditworthiness. Specifically, the NRSROs have placed increased scrutiny on JGBs, which are a significant component of the Company’s overall investment portfolio, resulting in downgrades as discussed later in this Risk Factors section. The NAIC is also considering changes to investment risk factors. Any negative developments by the NRSROs or NAIC in these areas could result in increased capital requirements for the Company.

We seek to match the investment currency and interest rate risk to our yen liabilities. The low level of interest rates available on yen-denominated securities has a negative effect on our overall net investment income. A large portion of the cash available for reinvestment each year is deployed in yen-denominated instruments and subject to the low level of yen interest rates.

Any potential deterioration in Japan

'

s credit quality, market access, the overall economy of Japan, or Japanese market volatility could adversely impact the business of Aflac in general and specifically Aflac Japan and our related results of operations and financial condition.

Lack of availability of acceptable yen-denominated investments could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

We attempt to match both the duration and currency of our assets with our liabilities. This is very difficult for Aflac Japan due to the lack of long-dated yen-denominated fixed income instruments.

Prior to the financial crisis of 2008, the Company was focused on investing cash flows in JGBs, which had relatively low yields, and utilizing private placement and perpetual securities to gain additional yield, extend the duration of the investment portfolio, and maintain yen exposure. The investment in private placements and perpetual securities has led to increased risks associated with illiquidity.


Starting in 2012, Aflac Japan augmented its investment strategy to include U.S. dollar-denominated securities which could then be hedged back to yen. Initially this program focused on public investment-grade bonds but has evolved over time to include U.S. dollar-denominated high yield corporate bonds, bank loans and middle market loans. As of

December 31, 2015

, Aflac Japan held approximately

$22.7 billion

in U.S. dollar-denominated income producing securities, at amortized cost, and approximately

$14.3 billion

of notional in foreign currency forwards and options to hedge principal currency risk. We plan to continue adding other instruments denominated in U.S. dollars to improve the portfolio diversification and/or return profile. Some of the U.S. dollar-denominated asset classes that we anticipate adding have less liquidity than investment-grade corporate bonds.  These strategies will continue to increase our exposure to U.S. interest rates, credit spreads and other risks. We have increased foreign exchange risk exposure as the comprehensive hedging program may not always correlate to the underlying U.S. dollar-denominated assets, thereby increasing earnings volatility. These risks can significantly impact the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

If we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our third-party service providers and business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected.

The collection, maintenance, use, protection, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our businesses are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) and in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  HIPAA also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as such term is defined in the HIPAA regulations).

With regard to personal  information obtained from policyholders, the  insured, or others, Aflac Japan is regulated in Japan by the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) and guidelines issued by FSA and other governmental authorities.

Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts and perform information security risk assessments with third-party service providers and business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. In addition, despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. The U.S. Congress and many states are considering new privacy and security requirements that would apply to our business. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, requirements, and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on our business models, the development of new administrative processes, and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also may impose further restrictions on our collection, disclosure and use of patient identifiable data that are housed in one or more of our administrative databases. Noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, theft or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, whether by us or by one of our vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations, including: material fines and penalties; compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages; consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices; adverse actions against our licenses to do business; and injunctive relief.

In addition, under Japanese laws and regulations, including the APPI, if a leak or loss of personal information by  Aflac Japan or its business associates should occur, depending on factors such as the volume of personal data involved and the likelihood of other secondary damage, Aflac Japan may be required to file reports to the FSA; issue public releases explaining such incident to the public; or become subject to an FSA business improvement order, which could pose a risk to our reputation.

We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate.

Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported financial position and results of operations. Aflac Japan's premiums and approximately half of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we purchase yen-denominated assets and U.S. dollar-denominated assets, which may be hedged to yen to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen-denominated financial statement items are, however, translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant


effect on our reported financial position and results of operations. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. Any unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As a result, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year. In addition, the weakening of the yen relative to the dollar will generally adversely affect the value of our yen-denominated investments in dollar terms. Foreign currency translation also impacts the computation of our risk-based capital ratio because Aflac Japan is consolidated in our U.S. statutory filings due to its status as a branch. Our required capital, as determined by the application of risk factors to our assets and liabilities, is proportionately more sensitive to changes in the exchange rate than our total adjusted capital. As a result, when the yen strengthens relative to the dollar, our RBC and SMR is suppressed. We engage in certain foreign currency hedging activities for the purpose of hedging the yen exposure to our net investment in our branch operations in Japan. These hedging activities are limited in scope and we cannot provide assurance that these activities will be effective.

Aflac Japan is exposed to further foreign exchange risk through its investment in unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated securities. When the yen strengthens, the unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated investments will experience unrealized foreign exchange losses, negatively impacting SMR. For regulatory accounting purposes for Aflac Japan, there are certain requirements for realizing impairments that could be triggered by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate and could negatively impact Aflac Japan's earnings and the corresponding repatriation and capital deployment.

Additionally, we are exposed to economic currency risk when yen cash flows are converted into dollars, resulting in an increase or decrease in our earnings when exchange gains or losses are realized. This primarily occurs when we repatriate funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., but it also has an impact when yen cash is converted to U.S. dollars for investment into U.S. dollar-denominated assets (as described above). The exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation may differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. We engage in foreign currency hedging activities to mitigate the exposure to this foreign exchange risk.

We engage in monthly stress testing related to derivatives used to hedge profit repatriation. This stress testing assures that we have sufficient eligible collateral to post in the event foreign exchange rates move against our current positions. The liquidity test is performed before any new derivative positions are entered into as well as on a forward-looking basis. The test simulates a three standard deviation movement in the foreign exchange rates over a three-month period. Given that we have a large exposure to JGBs, a similar test is not performed for the derivative positions on our U.S. dollar hedge program in the Aflac Japan investment portfolio.

For more information regarding foreign currency risk, see the Currency Risk subsection within the Market Risks of Financial Instruments section of MD&A in this report.

If future policy benefits, claims or expenses exceed those anticipated in establishing premiums and reserves, our financial results would be adversely affected.

We establish and carry, as a liability, reserves based on estimates of how much will be required to pay for future benefits and claims. We calculate these reserves using various assumptions and estimates, including premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policy; the timing, frequency and severity of the events covered by the insurance policy; and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with a portion of our net cash flow from operations. These assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims. If our actual experience is different from our assumptions or estimates, our reserves may prove inadequate. As a result, we would incur a charge to earnings in the period in which we determine such a shortfall exists, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

As a holding company, the Parent Company depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to transfer funds to it to meet its debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock.

The Parent Company is a holding company and has no direct operations or significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. Aflac is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to insurance regulations that impose certain


limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent Company. The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. In addition, the FSA may not allow profit repatriations or other transfers from Aflac Japan if they would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of Japanese policyholders.

The ability of Aflac to pay dividends or make other payments to the Parent Company could also be constrained by our dependence on financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies. Our ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on Aflac's capitalization level. Any inability of Aflac to pay dividends or make other payments to the Parent Company could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that the earnings from, or other available assets of, our operating subsidiaries will be sufficient to make distributions to enable us to operate.

The success of our business depends in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology.

Our business depends in large part on our technology systems for interacting with employers, policyholders, sales associates, and brokers, and our business strategy involves providing customers with easy-to-use products to meet their needs and ensuring employees have the technology in place to support those needs. Some of our information technology systems and software are older, legacy-type systems that are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards (including adequate business continuity procedures). We are in a continual state of upgrading and enhancing our business systems; however, these changes are always challenging in our complex integrated environment. Our success is dependent in large part on maintaining or improving the effectiveness of existing systems and continuing to develop and enhance information systems that support our business processes in a cost-efficient manner.

The concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular single-issuer or sector of the economy may have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Negative events or developments affecting any particular single issuer, industry, group of related industries or geographic sector may have an adverse impact on a particular holding or set of holdings. We seek to minimize this risk by maintaining an appropriate level of diversification. To the extent we have concentrated positions, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our global investment guidelines establish concentration limits for our investment portfolios.

At

December 31, 2015

, we held approximately

$36.9 billion

, or

38.4%

of our total debt and perpetual securities, in JGBs. After downgrades by two rating agencies in 2015, JGBs were rated A1/A+/A at

December 31, 2015

by Moody's, S&P and Fitch, respectively. At

December 31, 2015

,

11%

of our total portfolio of debt and perpetual securities was in the bank and financial institution sector. For further details on the concentrations within our investment portfolios see the Analysis of Financial Condition section of MD&A in this report.

A decline in the creditworthiness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.

We have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker dealers, derivative counterparties, commercial banks and other institutions.

We use derivative instruments to mitigate various risks associated with our investment portfolio, notes payable, and profit repatriation. We enter into a variety of agreements involving assorted instruments including foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, foreign currency and interest rate swaps, and options on interest rate swaps (or interest rate swaptions). To provide additional alternatives to increase our overall portfolio yield while managing our overall currency risk, starting in 2012, we have invested a significant portion of the investable cash flow generated by Aflac Japan into U.S. dollar-denominated investment grade public bonds and hedged these bonds to yen through the use of currency forward and option contracts. The derivative forward and option contracts are of a shorter maturity than the hedged bonds which creates roll-over risks within the hedging program. Due to changes in market environments, there is a risk the hedges become ineffective and lose the corresponding hedge accounting treatment. At

December 31, 2015

, we held foreign currency forwards and options of approximately

$14.3 billion

notional associated with Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-


denominated investments referenced above, foreign currency swaps of

$3.7 billion

notional associated with our notes payable, and foreign currency forwards and options of approximately

$1.0 billion

notional used to economically hedge profit repatriation. The Company

'

s increased use of derivatives has increased our financial exposure to derivative counterparties. To mitigate counterparty exposure, we have established internal limits based on counterparties' credit ratings. Our internal limits include deposit and derivative exposure that we monitor on a daily basis. If our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under derivative instruments, our hedges of the risks will be ineffective.

We engage in derivative transactions directly with unaffiliated third parties under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements and other documentation. Most of the ISDA agreements we enter into also include Credit Support Annexes (CSA), which generally provide for two-way collateral postings, in certain cases at the first dollar of exposure and in other cases once various rating and exposure threshold levels are triggered. We attempt to mitigate the risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value while generally requiring that collateral be posted at the outset of a transaction or that collateral be posted upon the occurrence of certain events or circumstances. In addition, a significant portion of the derivative transactions have provisions that require collateral to be posted upon a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings or give the counterparty the right to terminate the transaction upon a downgrade of Aflac’s financial strength ratings. The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions, and other factors prevailing at and after the time of any such downgrade. If the Company is required to post collateral to support derivative contracts and/or pay cash to settle the contracts at maturity, the Company

'

s liquidity could be strained. We have implemented a liquidity test to determine that sufficient collateral is available when the Company is required to post collateral and/or pay cash.

Further, we have agreements with various financial institutions for the distribution of our insurance products. For example, at

December 31, 2015

, we had agreements with


banks to market Aflac's products in Japan. Sales through these banks represented

14.9%

of Aflac Japan's new annualized premium sales in


. Any material adverse effect on these or other financial institutions could also have an adverse effect on our sales.

The Company has entered into significant reinsurance transactions with large, highly rated counterparties. Negative events or developments affecting any one of these counterparties could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

All of these risks related to exposure to other financial institutions could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

Sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract, retain and support a network of qualified sales associates.

Our sales could be adversely affected if our sales networks deteriorate or if we do not adequately provide support, training and education for our existing network. Competition exists for sales associates with demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers and financial institutions primarily on the basis of our products, compensation, support services and financial rating. An inability to attract and retain qualified sales associates could have a material adverse effect on sales and our results of operations and financial condition. Our sales associates are independent contractors and may sell products of our competitors. If our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours, or pay higher commissions than we do, these sales associates may concentrate their efforts on selling our competitors' products instead of ours. In addition to our commissioned sales force, Aflac has expanded its sales leadership team to include a salaried sales force of over 175 market directors and broker sales professionals. Our ability to attract and retain top talent in these salaried roles has a material impact on our sales success.

The valuation of our investments and derivatives includes methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

The vast majority of our financial instruments are subject to the fair value classification provisions under U.S. GAAP, which specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on observable or unobservable inputs to valuations, and relates to our investment securities classified as available for sale in our investment portfolio, which comprised

$67.8 billion

(

64%

) of our total cash and invested assets, and our entire derivatives portfolio, comprising

$676 million

of derivative assets and

$371 million

of derivative liabilities, as of

December 31, 2015

. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have categorized these


securities and derivatives into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1). It gives the next priority to quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities and other inputs that can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities (Level 2). The lowest priority represents unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that reflect the reporting entity's understanding about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (Level 3). An asset or liability's classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation.

At

December 31, 2015

, approximately

28%

and

72%

of our total available-for-sale securities represented Level 1 and Level 2 securities, respectively, and approximately

62%

and

38%

of our total derivatives exposure were classified as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively. Financial instruments may be transferred to Level 3 from Levels 1 and 2 during periods of market disruption or illiquidity.

As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods which are more sophisticated, thereby resulting in values which may be greater or less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly.

Valuations of our derivatives fluctuate with changes in underlying market variables, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. During periods of market turbulence created by political instability, economic uncertainty, government interventions or other factors, we may experience significant changes in the volatility of our derivative valuations. Extreme market conditions can also affect the liquidity of such instruments creating marked differences in transaction levels and counterparty valuations. Depending on the severity and direction of the movements in its derivative valuations, the Company will face increases in the amount of collateral required to be posted with its counterparties. Liquidity stresses to the Company may also occur if the required collateral amounts increase significantly over a very short period of time. Conversely, the Company may be exposed to an increase in counterparty credit risk for short periods of time while calling collateral from its counterparties.

For further discussion on investment and derivative valuations, see Notes 1, 3, 4, and


of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

The determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments is based on significant valuation judgments and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.

An investment in a fixed maturity, perpetual or equity security is impaired if the fair value falls below book value. We regularly review our entire investment portfolio for declines in value. The majority of our investments are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment using our debt impairment model, while our investments in equities and below-investment-grade perpetual securities are evaluated using our equity impairment model.

Our debt impairment model includes emphasis on the ultimate collection of the cash flows from our investments. The determination of the amount of impairments under this model is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective securities. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.

For our fixed maturity and perpetual securities reported in the available-for-sale portfolio, we report the investments at fair value in the statement of financial condition and record any unrealized gain or loss in the value of the asset in accumulated other comprehensive income. For our held-to-maturity portfolio, we report the investments at amortized cost. The determination of whether an impairment in value is other than temporary is based largely on our evaluation of the issuer

'

s creditworthiness. We must apply considerable judgment in determining the likelihood of the security recovering in value while we own it. Factors that may influence this include our assessment of the issuer’s ability to continue making timely payments of interest and principal, the overall level of interest rates and credit spreads, and other factors. We also verify our intent to hold the securities until they recover in value. If we determine it is unlikely we will recover our book value of the instrument prior to our disposal of the security, we will reduce the carrying value of the security to its fair value and recognize any associated impairment loss in our consolidated statement of earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the nature of the loss.


Our investments in perpetual securities that are rated below investment grade and equity securities are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment under our equity impairment model. This impairment model focuses on the severity of a security's decline in fair value coupled with the length of time the fair value of the security has been below cost or amortized cost and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. For equity securities, we also verify our intent to hold the securities until they recover in value.

For regulatory accounting purposes for Aflac Japan, there are certain requirements for realizing impairments that could be triggered by rising interest rates or credit-related losses, negatively impacting Aflac Japan's earnings and corresponding repatriation and capital deployment.

Our management updates its evaluations regularly as conditions change and as new information becomes available and reflects impairment losses in the Company's income statement when considered necessary. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments.

We are subject to certain risks as a result of our investments in perpetual securities.

As of

December 31, 2015

, we held

$1.8 billion

of perpetual securities, at amortized cost, which represented

1.9%

of our total portfolio of debt and perpetual securities. Perpetual securities have characteristics of both debt and equity instruments. These securities do not have a stated maturity date, but generally have a stated fixed rate coupon that was fixed at the time of issuance but then changes to a floating rate coupon at some predetermined date. Most perpetual securities have call features including the ability of the issuer to retire the debt at par upon the change to a floating rate security. Generally, the mechanics of the floating rate change were intended at the time of issuance to incent the borrower to call the instrument, having the effect of creating an expected economic maturity date. We believe many of the issuers of our perpetual securities will call the instruments upon a change in payment structure but there are no assurances the issuers will do so. While we have recently experienced calls for certain perpetual securities upon their economic maturity dates, there can be no assurance the remaining issuers will have the ability to repay the outstanding principal amount.

Perpetual securities may contain provisions allowing the borrower to defer paying interest for a time. In some cases, we have contractual provisions that stipulate any deferred interest payment accumulates for our benefit and must be paid in the future. There is no assurance such issuers will not choose to defer making payments or will be able to honor a cumulative deferral feature.

There is also a risk that the accounting for these perpetual securities could change in a manner that would have an adverse impact on the reporting for these securities. At the date of filing this Form 10-K, the SEC does not object to the use of a debt impairment model for impairment recognition of these securities as long as there is no significant deterioration in the credit condition of the perpetual securities. The debt impairment model allows the holder to consider whether or not interest and principal payments will be received in accordance with contractual terms and whether the holder has the intent to sell or if it is more likely than not would be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. The equity impairment model applied to below-investment-grade perpetual securities, by contrast, emphasizes the length of time a security's fair value has been below its cost basis and the percentage decline to determine whether an impairment should be recorded, without consideration to the holder's intent and ability to hold the security until recovery in value. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) recently issued new accounting guidance on financial instruments classification and measurement and is also working on the financial instruments project which addresses impairment and hedging. The impact of the FASB project is uncertain but could result in changes to the current accounting model for perpetual securities. For information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Any decrease in our financial strength or debt ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position and access to liquidity and capital.

Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on the business of insurance companies. On an ongoing basis NRSROs review the financial performance and condition of insurers and may downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer's ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurer's statutory capital; a change in a rating agency's determination of the amount of risk-adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer's investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in management; or other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer's control. In addition to financial strength ratings, various NRSROs also publish ratings on our debt. These ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner and are important factors in our


ability to access liquidity and capital from the debt markets or other available sources, such as reinsurance. Downgrades in our credit ratings could give our derivative counterparties the right to require early termination of derivatives transactions or delivery of additional collateral, thereby adversely affecting our liquidity.

In view of the difficulties experienced after the financial crisis by many financial institutions, including in the insurance industry, the NRSROs have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, increased the frequency and scope of their reviews, requested additional information from the companies that they rate, including additional information regarding the valuation of investment securities held, and, in certain cases, have increased the capital and other requirements employed in their models for maintenance of certain rating levels.

On September 16, 2015, S&P downgraded their rating of Japan’s sovereign credit risk. They also downgraded several other foreign insurers, including Aflac. S&P has stated in the past that a downgrade of Japan's sovereign rating would lead to a downgrade of our financial strength rating. S&P rarely rates insurance companies above the sovereign long-term rating of the country of domicile because during times of stress, the sovereign’s regulatory and supervisory powers may restrict an insurer’s or financial system’s flexibility. Although we are a U.S.-based insurer, our significant operations in Japan and corresponding regulation by the Japanese FSA, combined with our significant exposure to JGBs as outlined above, resulted in S&P downgrading Aflac’s financial strength rating to A+ with a stable outlook.

A downgrade in our ratings could have a material adverse effect on agent recruiting and retention, sales, competitiveness and the marketability of our products which could negatively impact our liquidity, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, sales through the bank channel in Japan could be adversely affected as a result of their reliance and sensitivity to ratings levels.

We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any NRSRO.

Our risk management policies and procedures may prove to be ineffective and leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses or result in losses.

We have developed an enterprise-wide risk management and governance framework to mitigate risk and loss to the Company. We maintain policies, procedures and controls intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the risks to which the Company is exposed.

However, there are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company may suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. As our businesses change and the markets in which we operate evolve, our risk management framework may not evolve at the same pace as those changes. As a result, there is a risk that new products or new business strategies may present risks that are not appropriately identified, monitored or managed. In times of market stress, unanticipated market movements or unanticipated claims experience resulting from greater than expected morbidity, mortality, longevity, or persistency, the effectiveness of our risk management strategies may be limited, resulting in losses to the Company. In addition, under difficult or less liquid market conditions, our risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be using the same or similar strategies to manage risk under the same challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult or more expensive for the Company to mitigate risk due to the activity of such other market participants.

Many of our risk management strategies or techniques are based upon historical customer and market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. We cannot provide assurance that our risk management framework, including the underlying assumptions or strategies, will be accurate and effective.

Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies, procedures and controls to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies, procedures and controls may not be fully effective. Models are utilized by our businesses and corporate areas primarily to project future cash flows associated with pricing products, calculating reserves and valuing assets, as well as in evaluating risk and determining capital requirements, among other uses. These models may not operate properly and rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. As our businesses continue to grow and evolve, the number and complexity of models we


utilize expands, increasing our exposure to error in the design, implementation or use of models, including the associated input data and assumptions. Given that there is risk involved with using any models, we are in the process of developing a model risk framework. Our risk committee has approved a model risk policy, which describes the necessary governance related to our models.

Past or future misconduct by our employees or employees of our third parties (suppliers which are cost-based relationships and alliance partners which are revenue-generating relationships) could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Despite our published Supplier Code of Conduct, due diligence of our alliance partners, and rigorous contracting procedures (including financial, legal, IT security, and risk reviews), there can be no assurance that controls and procedures that we employ, which are designed to assess third party viability and prevent us from taking excessive or inappropriate risks, will be effective. We review our supplier cost structures and alliance compensation policies and practices as part of our overall risk management program, but it is possible that these cost structures and forms of compensation could inadvertently incentivize excessive or inappropriate risk taking. If our third parties take excessive or inappropriate risks, those risks could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Extensive regulation and changes in legislation can impact profitability and growth.

Aflac's insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, the SEC, the NAIC, the FIO, the FSA and Ministry of Finance (MOF) in Japan, the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general,

the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and

the U.S. Treasury, including the Internal Revenue Service, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. In addition, proposals regarding the global regulation of insurance are under discussion. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal or regulatory issue may not result in compliance with another regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. There is also a risk that any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal or regulatory issue may change over time to our detriment. In addition, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business.

The primary purpose of insurance company regulatory supervision is the protection of insurance policyholders, rather than investors. The extent of regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes in the United States and by the FSA and the MOF in Japan. These systems of supervision and regulation cover, among other things:

•

standards of establishing and setting premium rates and the approval thereof

•

standards of minimum capital and reserve requirements and solvency margins, including risk-based capital measures

•

restrictions on, limitations on and required approval of certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates, including management fee arrangements

•

restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments

•

restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations

•

limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay or foreign profits that can be repatriated

•

the existence and licensing status of a company under circumstances where it is not writing new or renewal business

•

certain required methods of accounting

•

reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes

•

assignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies

•

administrative practices requirements

•

imposition of fines and other sanctions


Regulatory authorities periodically re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including health care reform legislation, financial services reform legislation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation, can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. Various forms of federal oversight and regulation of insurance have been passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by the president. For example, the ACA, federal health care reform legislation, gives the U.S. federal government direct regulatory authority over the business of health insurance. The reform includes major changes to the U.S. health care insurance marketplace. Among other changes, the reform legislation includes an individual medical insurance coverage mandate, provides for penalties on certain employers for failing to provide adequate coverage, creates health insurance exchanges, and addresses coverage and exclusions as well as medical loss ratios. The legislation also includes changes in government reimbursements and tax credits for individuals and employers and alters federal and state regulation of health insurers. These changes, directed toward major medical health insurance coverage which Aflac does not offer, will continue to be implemented over the next several years. While enacted in 2010, the major elements of the bill became effective on January 1, 2014. We believe that the ACA, as enacted, does not materially affect the design of our insurance products. However, indirect consequences of the legislation and regulations could present challenges and/or opportunities that could potentially have an impact on our sales model, financial condition and results of operations.

On December 18, 2015, the president signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act which included a revision to delay implementation of the Excise Tax on High Cost Plans, better known as the "Cadillac tax.” This tax was originally scheduled to begin in 2017, was previously delayed until 2018, and is now scheduled to begin in 2020. The tax consists of 40% of the cost of employer sponsored health coverage in excess of certain dollar thresholds. In general, only Aflac specified disease and fixed indemnity (i.e. supplemental health) products offered on a pre-tax basis are taken into account under this tax.

The legislation also makes the tax deductible by the payer. If employers fund coverage on a pre-tax basis, Aflac, as the insurer, would be liable for its pro-rata share of any tax on excess coverage, determined based on the cost of Aflac coverage compared to the total cost of the applicable health coverage in which each employee is enrolled. Making the tax deductible would then reduce the economic impact of any tax that is imposed and payable by Aflac.

Many employers are concerned about the tax and what impact it will have on benefit offerings in the future. There is confusion in the market about how the tax is calculated and who pays the tax, presenting a risk that some employers will mistakenly conclude that

all supplemental health products are included in the calculation for the tax regardless of pre-tax funding status or whether an employer’s health coverage exceeds the trigger for the tax. Some employers may decide simply to drop coverage of affected supplemental health products, rather than convert it to an after-tax basis. During this extended implementation period, Aflac will be assessing the impact of this tax; educating employers about the tax; and investigating ways to mitigate the impact of the tax. Having employees pay for the coverage on an after-tax basis would exempt affected supplemental health products from the tax.

In 2010, the president signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly known as the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, created a Financial Stability Oversight Council (the Council). In April 2012, the Council released a final rule describing the general process it will follow in determining whether to designate a nonbank financial company for supervision by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (the Board). The Council may designate by a two-thirds vote whether certain nonbank financial companies, including certain insurance companies and insurance holding companies, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States, in which case such nonbank financial companies would become subject to prudential regulation by the Board. On April 3, 2013, the Board published a final rule that establishes the requirements for determining when a nonbank financial company is "predominantly engaged in financial activities" - a prerequisite for designation by the Council. Prudential regulation by the Board includes supervision of capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements and examinations. The Board may limit such company’s ability to enter into mergers, acquisitions and other business combination transactions, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate one or more activities, or impose conditions on the manner in which it conducts activities. The Council designated two insurers in 2013 and an additional insurer in 2014 for supervision by the Board. On December 18, 2014, the president signed the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act into law. This legislation clarifies the Board’s authority to apply insurance-based capital standards for insurance companies subject to federal supervision. Although Aflac is a nonbank financial company predominantly engaged in financial activities as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, we do not believe Aflac will be considered a company that poses a threat to the financial stability of the United States.


Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations issued thereunder may have an impact on Aflac's derivative activity, including activity on behalf of Aflac Japan, in particular rules to require central clearing and collateral for certain types of derivatives. In 2014, the five U.S. banking regulators and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) re-proposed for comment their rules regarding collateral for uncleared swaps. Final rules were issued by the five U.S. banking regulators on October 22, 2015 and by the CFTC on December 16, 2015. Such rules may result in increased collateral requirements or affect other aspects of Aflac's derivatives activity.

The Dodd-Frank Act also established an FIO under the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance. Traditionally, U.S. insurance companies have been regulated primarily by state insurance departments. In December 2013, the FIO released a report entitled "How To Modernize And Improve The System Of Insurance Regulation In The United States." The report was required by the Dodd-Frank Act, and included 18 recommended areas of near-term reform for the states, including addressing capital adequacy and safety/soundness issues, reform of insurer resolution practices, and reform of marketplace regulation. The report also listed nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation. Some of the recommendations outlined in the FIO report released in December 2013 have been implemented. Of the nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation that are applicable to Aflac, the president has signed the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act into law in January 2015, which simplifies the agent and broker licensing process across state lines. The FIO has also engaged with the supervisory colleges to monitor financial stability and identify regulatory gaps for large national and internationally active insurers.

The process of implementing the Dodd-Frank Act is ongoing and continues to involve additional rulemaking from time to time. At the current time, it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty what impact, if any, the Dodd-Frank Act will have on our U.S. business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Changes in domestic or foreign tax laws or interpretations of such laws could increase our corporate taxes and reduce our earnings. Additionally, global budget deficits make it likely that governments’ need for additional revenue will result in future tax proposals that will increase our effective tax rate. However, it remains difficult to predict the timing and effect that future tax law changes could have on our earnings both in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.

Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, could harm our business.

We depend heavily on our telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data we use to run our businesses and service our customers. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our information technology and other systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering, security breaches or other cyber-attacks, resulting in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to customers, or in the misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information. Although the minor data leakage issues we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, whether due to actions by us or others, could delay or disrupt our ability to do business and service our customers, harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and other claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business.

Catastrophic events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events including, but not necessarily limited to, epidemics, pandemics, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and acts of terrorism. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Certain events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and man-made catastrophes could cause substantial damage or loss of life in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man−made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year


and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition, as well as affect our ability to write new business.

Changes in accounting standards issued by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in both the United States and Japan, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. During the last three years, various accounting standard-setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements, interpretations and exposure drafts. For information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Managing key executive succession is critical to our success.

We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for succession of our senior management and other key executives. While we have succession plans and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these plans cannot guarantee that the services of these executives will be available to us, and our operations could be adversely affected if they are not.

We face risks related to litigation.

We are a defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the normal course of business. Members of our senior legal and financial management teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. The final results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. Although some of this litigation is pending in states where large punitive damages, bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs, have been awarded in recent years, we believe the outcome of pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, costs of settlement or judgments against us or because of changes in our operations that could result from litigation.

Changes in our discount rate, expected rate of return, life expectancy, health care cost and expected compensation increase assumptions for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.

We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on assumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, life expectancy of plan participants and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. Changes in these assumptions, including from the impact of a sustained low interest rate environment, may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.

We operate in an industry that is subject to ongoing changes.

We operate in a competitive environment and in an industry that is subject to ongoing changes from market pressures brought about by customer demands, legislative reform, marketing practices and changes to health care and health insurance delivery. These factors require us to anticipate market trends and make changes to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors. We also face the potential of competition from existing or new companies in the United States and Japan that have not historically been active in the supplemental health insurance industry. Failure to anticipate market trends and/or to differentiate our products and services can affect our ability to retain or grow profitable lines of business.


Events, including those external to our operations, could damage our reputation.

Because insurance products are intangible, we rely to a large extent on consumer trust in our business. The perception of financial weakness could create doubt regarding our ability to honor the commitments we have made to our policyholders. Maintaining our stature as a responsible corporate citizen, which helps support the strength of our unique brand, is critical to our reputation and the failure or perceived failure to do so could adversely affect us.

We also face other risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, which include:

•

any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles

•

failure to appropriately maintain controls over models used to generate significant inputs to the Company’s financial statements

•

a significant failure of internal controls over financial reporting

•

failure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements

•

failure of corporate governance policies and procedures

The third campus comprises leased space for the information technology departments. Aflac also leases additional office space in Tokyo, along with regional offices located throughout the country.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the normal course of business. Members of our senior legal and financial management teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. The final results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. Although some of this litigation is pending in states where large punitive damages, bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs, have been awarded in recent years, we believe the outcome of pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

OUR BUSINESS

Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The Company's insurance business is marketed and administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflac's policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Aflac U.S. also markets and administers group products through Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC), branded as Aflac Group Insurance. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business.

In August 2015, we paid off $300 million of 3.45% fixed-rate senior notes upon their maturity. In August 2015, we paid off a 5.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $41 million using the exchange rate at the maturity date). In July 2015, we paid off a 10.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $81 million using the exchange rate at the maturity date). In March 2015, the Parent Company issued $1.0 billion of senior notes through a U.S. public debt offering. We entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to economically convert the U.S. dollar denominated principal and interest on the senior notes we issued into yen-denominated obligations. In April 2015, the Parent Company used the proceeds from the March 2015 issuance of our fixed-rate senior notes to redeem all of its $850 million 8.50% fixed-rate senior notes due May 2019 and to pay a portion of the corresponding $230 million make-whole premium due to the investors of these notes.


In October 2015, the Parent Company and Aflac jointly entered into a 364-day uncommitted bilateral line of credit that provides for borrowings in the amount of $100 million. In September 2015, the Parent Company and Aflac amended a 50 billion yen revolving credit facility, resulting in jointly entering into an unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that provides for borrowings in the amount of 55 billion yen. In February 2015, the Parent Company and Aflac jointly entered into an uncommitted bilateral line of credit with a third party that provides for borrowings in the amount of $50 million. For further information regarding these transactions, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of this MD&A.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These principles are established primarily by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). In this MD&A, references to U.S. GAAP issued by the FASB are derived from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification

TM

(ASC). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. The estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of Aflac's results of operations and financial condition are those related to the valuation of investments and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, and income taxes. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management's analyses and judgments. The application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which

93%

of our assets and

77%

of our liabilities are reported as of

December 31, 2015

, and thus has a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders' equity. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.

Investments and Derivatives

Aflac's investments, primarily consisting of debt, perpetual and equity securities, include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. For publicly issued securities, we determine the fair values from quoted market prices readily available from public exchange markets and price quotes and valuations from third party pricing vendors. For the majority of privately issued securities within our investment portfolio, a third party pricing vendor has developed valuation models to determine fair values. For the remaining privately issued securities, we use non-binding price quotes from outside brokers. We also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. The identification of distressed investments, the determination of fair value if not publicly traded and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment.

We must apply considerable judgment in determining the likelihood of the security recovering in value while we own it. Factors that may influence this include our assessment of the issuer’s ability to continue making timely payments of interest and principal, the overall level of interest rates and credit spreads, and other factors. This process requires consideration of risks which can be controlled to a certain extent, such as credit risk, and risks which cannot be controlled, such as interest rate risk. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairment losses in the Company's net earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the nature of the loss, as such evaluations are revised.

Our derivative activities include foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in VIEs that are consolidated; foreign currency swaps associated with certain senior notes and our subordinated debentures; foreign currency forwards and options used in hedging foreign exchange risk and options on interest rate swaps (or interest rate swaptions) used in hedging interest rate risk on U.S. dollar-denominated securities in Aflac Japan's portfolio; and foreign currency forwards and options used to economically hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen. Inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency forward and spot rates, and interest volatility. With the exception of the derivatives associated with our VIE investments, the fair values of the derivatives referenced above are based on the amounts we would expect to receive or pay to terminate the derivatives. For derivatives associated with VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary, we receive valuations from a third party pricing vendor.

See Notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.


Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Policy Liabilities

Aflac's products are generally long-duration fixed-benefit indemnity contracts. We make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business to match expected policy benefits and deferrable acquisition costs with expected policy premiums. These factors include persistency, morbidity, mortality, investment yields and expenses. If actual results match the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs, profits are expected to emerge ratably over the life of the policy. However, because actual results will vary from the assumptions, profits as a percentage of earned premiums will vary from year to year.

We measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of DAC annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business. Our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our DAC is recoverable.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

Certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policy's premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income. Future amortization of DAC is based upon our estimates of persistency, interest and future premium revenue generally established at the time of policy issuance. However, the unamortized balance of DAC reflects actual persistency. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detail of the DAC activity for the past two years.

Policy Liabilities

The following table provides details of policy liabilities by segment and in total as of December 31.

Policy Liabilities

(1)

The sum of the Japan and U.S. segments exceeds the total due to reinsurance and retrocession activity.

Our policy liabilities, which are determined in accordance with applicable guidelines as defined under U.S. GAAP and Actuarial Standards of Practice, include two components that involve analysis and judgment: future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, which accounted for

80%

and

4%

of total policy liabilities as of

December 31, 2015

, respectively.

Future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. We calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and interest. These assumptions are generally established at the time a policy is issued. The assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy. As required by U.S. GAAP, we also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience.


Unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us. We compute unpaid policy claims on a non-discounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. We update the assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability.

Our insurance products provide fixed-benefit amounts per occurrence that are not subject to medical-cost inflation. Furthermore, our business is widely dispersed in both the United States and Japan. This geographic dispersion and the nature of our benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. Claims incurred under Aflac's policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame. The unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and frequency of claims. Severity is the ultimate size of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. Our claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders.

As a part of our established financial reporting and accounting practices and controls, we perform detailed annual actuarial reviews of our policyholder liabilities (gross premium valuation analysis) and reflect the results of those reviews in our results of operations and financial condition as required by U.S. GAAP. For Aflac Japan, our annual review in


indicated that we needed to strengthen the liability associated with a block of care policies, primarily due to low investment yields. We strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $18 million in 2015 as a result of this review. Our review in 2014 and 2013 indicated no need to strengthen liabilities associated with policies in Japan. For Aflac U.S., our annual reviews in


and 2014 indicated no need to strengthen liabilities associated with policies in the United States. Our review in 2013 indicated that we needed to strengthen the liability associated primarily with long-term care in the United States. We strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $


million in 2013 as a result of this review

.

The table below reflects the growth of the future policy benefits liability for the years ended December 31.

Future Policy Benefits

The growth of the future policy benefits liability in yen for Aflac Japan and in dollars for Aflac U.S. has been due to the aging of our in-force block of business and the addition of new business.

In computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, we consider many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices. We monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges. Claim levels are generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. In calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, we do not calculate a range of estimates. The following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid policy claims liability as of

December 31, 2015

, to changes in severity and frequency of claims.


Sensitivity of Unpaid Policy Claims Liability

Other policy liabilities, which accounted for

16%

of total policy liabilities as of

December 31, 2015

, consisted primarily of discounted advance premiums on deposit from policyholders in conjunction with their purchase of certain Aflac Japan insurance products. These advanced premiums are deferred upon collection and recognized as premium revenue over the contractual premium payment period. Advanced premiums represented

43%

and

47%

of the

December 31, 2015

and


other policy liabilities balances, respectively. See the Aflac Japan segment subsection of this MD&A for further information.

Income Taxes

Income tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing our income tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with U.S. GAAP is a two-step process. Under the first step, the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The second step is measurement, whereby a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized. The determination of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions.

In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our management considers all available evidence, including taxable income in open carry back years, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, future taxable temporary difference reversals, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine it is not more likely than not that we will be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Future economic conditions and market volatility, including increases in interest rates or widening credit spreads, can adversely impact the Company’s tax planning strategies and in particular the Company’s ability to utilize tax benefits on previously recognized capital losses. Our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions.

Interest rates and credit spreads in both the United States and Japan are not the only factors that impact the Company’s unrealized gain/loss position and the evaluation of a need for a valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax asset, but they do have a direct and significant effect on both. Based on our methodology described above for evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future, therefore we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of

December 31, 2015

.

See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

New Accounting Pronouncements

During the last three years, various accounting standard-setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements, interpretations and exposure drafts. For information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion includes references to our performance measures, operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share

,

that are not based on U.S. GAAP. Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with U.S. GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is our measure of segment performance. Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of our underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is conducted in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact of translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars.

Aflac defines operating earnings (a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure) as the profits derived from operations. Operating earnings includes interest cash flows associated with notes payable but excludes items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of management's control, such as realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities; nonrecurring items; and other non-operating income (loss) from net earnings. Aflac's derivative activities are primarily used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk in our investment portfolio as well as manage foreign exchange risk for certain notes payable and forecasted cash flows denominated in yen. Our management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac’s insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as other and nonrecurring items, tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with the Company’s insurance operations, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac’s insurance operations.

The following table is a reconciliation of items impacting operating and net earnings and operating and net earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31.

Reconciliation of Operating Earnings to Net Earnings

(1)

Excludes a gain of

$54

,

$28

and

$6

, after tax, in


,


and


, respectively, related to the interest rate component of the change in fair value of foreign currency swaps on notes payable which is classified as an operating gain when analyzing segment operations

(2)

Includes a loss of

$13

, after tax, in


related to the change in value of yen repatriation received in advance of settlement of certain foreign currency derivatives. This loss was offset by derivative gains included in other derivative and hedging activities.

Realized Investment Gains and Losses

Our investment strategy is to invest in fixed-maturity securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the Company’s growth and profitability. This investment strategy incorporates asset-liability matching (ALM) to align the expected cash flows of the portfolio to the needs of the Company's liability structure. We do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses. However, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and/or general portfolio management and rebalancing. The realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which are the principal drivers of our profitability.


Securities Transactions and Impairments

During


, we realized pretax investment

gains

, net of

losses

, of

$303 million

(

$197 million

after-tax) from sales and redemptions of securities. These net gains primarily resulted from sales of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) as part of a portfolio repositioning exercise. We realized pretax investment

losses

of

$153 million

(

$100 million

after-tax) as a result of the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses on certain securities. Investment losses were primarily related to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment loss on a single holding.

During


, we realized pretax investment gains, net of losses, of

$215 million

(

$140 million

after-tax) from sales and redemptions of securities. These net gains primarily resulted from gains on sales of JGBs and our U.S. Treasury holdings, currency gains from transactions by our externally managed portfolio of U.S. dollar-denominated bank loans, and assorted other bond sales and calls. We realized pretax investment losses of

$31 million

(

$20 million

after-tax)

as a result of the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses on certain securities.

During


, we realized pretax investment gains, net of losses, of

$262 million

(

$170 million

after-tax) from sales and redemptions of securities. These net gains primarily resulted from sales of JGBs as part of a portfolio repositioning exercise. We also realized modest gains from bond tender offers of several of our holdings. We realized pretax investment losses of

$199 million

(

$129 million

after-tax) as a result of the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses on certain securities.

See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on these investment activities.

The following table details our pretax impairment losses by investment category for the years ended December 31.

Impact of Derivative and Hedging Activities

Our derivative activities include foreign currency swaps and credit default swaps held in consolidated VIEs; foreign currency forwards and options, interest rate swaptions and futures on certain fixed-maturity securities; foreign currency forwards and options that economically hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen; and foreign currency swaps associated with certain senior notes and our subordinated debentures.

as a result of valuing these derivatives, net of the effects of hedge accounting. For a description of other items that could be included in the Impact of Derivative and Hedging Activities, see the Hedging Activities subsection of MD&A and Note 4 of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For additional information regarding realized investment gains and losses, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other and Non-recurring Items

During the second quarter of 2015, the make-whole premium paid to the investors of our 8.50% fixed-rate senior notes for the early redemption of those notes was recorded as a $230 million pretax non-operating loss ($150 million after-tax, or $.35 per diluted share). The Company also includes the accounting impacts of remeasurement associated with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate as an other non-operating item.


Foreign Currency Translation

Aflac Japan’s premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we have yen-denominated assets that support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen-denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. We translate Aflac Japan’s yen-denominated income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate its yen-denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period.

Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac rather than an economic event to our Company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, management evaluates Aflac’s financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.

Income Taxes

Our combined U.S. and Japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was

34.4%

in


,

34.3%

in


and

34.4%

in


.

Total income taxes were

$1.3 billion

in


, compared with

$1.5 billion

in


and

$1.7 billion

in


. Japanese income taxes on Aflac Japan's results account for most of our consolidated income tax expense. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Earnings Guidance

Our original objective for


was to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 2% to 7% over


, and we revised the objective during the year to a 4% to 7% increase, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. In April 2015, we executed a make-whole transaction to enhance our consolidated capital position (see the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of this MD&A for further discussion). As a result of this transaction, we incurred a non-operating charge of $.35 to operating earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. However, operating earnings per diluted share benefited by approximately $.07 for the full year 2015 due to a net reduction in interest expense. We reported


net earnings per diluted share of

$5.85

. Adjusting that number for after-tax realized investment gains (

$.09

per diluted share), other non-operating expense ($

.40

per diluted share), and foreign currency translation (an expense of

$.46

per diluted share), we finished the year above the top of the target range with a

7.5%

increase in operating earnings per diluted share.

Stronger than expected earnings growth from 2015 will create tough comparisons in 2016. Our objective for 2016 is to produce stable operating earnings per diluted share of $6.17 to $6.41, assuming the average exchange rate in 2015 of 120.99 yen to the dollar. With volatile financial markets and interest rates at significantly depressed levels, it is difficult to safely invest cash flows at attractive yields. Additionally, 2016 benefit ratios in both the U.S. and Japan anticipate continued favorable experience. If we achieve our objective for 2016, the following table shows the likely results for operating earnings per diluted share, including the impact of foreign currency translation using various yen/dollar exchange rate scenarios.

INSURANCE OPERATIONS

Aflac's insurance business consists of two segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. Aflac Japan, which operates as a branch of Aflac, is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings. U.S. GAAP financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual and interim period financial statements. Furthermore, we are required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets.

We evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium sales, an industry operating measure. New annualized premium sales, which include both new sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions, represent the premiums that we would collect over a 12-month period, assuming the policies remain in force. For Aflac Japan, new annualized premium sales are determined by applications submitted during the reporting period. For Aflac U.S., new annualized premium sales are determined by applications that are issued during the reporting period. Premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period.

AFLAC JAPAN SEGMENT

Aflac Japan Pretax Operating Earnings

Changes in Aflac Japan's pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac Japan for the years ended December 31.

Aflac Japan Summary of Operating Results

(1)

See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings.

The relatively small change in premium income in yen for 2015 and 2014 was influenced by the impact of weak first sector sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013 in addition to premiums ceded in reinsurance transactions during those same years. Annualized premiums in force at

December 31, 2015

, were

1.62 trillion

yen, compared with

1.59 trillion

yen in


and


1.57 trillion

yen in


. The increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of

1.5%

in


,

1.7%

in


and

5.0%

in


reflect the sales of new policies combined with the high persistency of Aflac Japan's business. Annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year-end exchange rates, were $

13.4 billion

in


,

$13.2 billion

in


, and

$14.9 billion

in


.

Aflac Japan's investment portfolios include dollar-denominated securities and reverse-dual currency securities (yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). U.S. dollar-denominated investment income from these assets accounted for approximately

50%

of Aflac Japan's investment income in


, compared with

46%

in


and

44%

in


. In years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. In years when the yen weakens, translating U.S. dollar-denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. Excluding foreign currency changes from the respective prior year, U.S. dollar-denominated investment income accounted for approximately

46%

of Aflac Japan's investment income during


, compared with

44%

in


and

39%

in


.

The following table illustrates the effect of translating Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had yen/dollar exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year.

Aflac Japan Percentage Changes Over Prior Year

(Yen Operating Results)

See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings.

Amounts excluding foreign currency changes on U.S. dollar-denominated items were determined using the same yen/dollar exchange                                                              rate for the current year as each respective prior year.

The following table presents a summary of operating ratios in yen terms for Aflac Japan for the years ended December 31.

(1)

See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings.

In 2015, the benefit ratio decreased compared with 2014, resulting from the impact of reinsurance; changes in foreign currency; and favorable claims experience. The three reinsurance agreements that we entered into since the end of the third quarter of 2013 reduced the benefit ratio by approximately


basis points for 2015. The benefit ratio has also been influenced by the effect of low investment yields, which impacts our profit margin by reducing the spread between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves (see table and discussion in the Interest Rate Risk subsection of this MD&A). In 2015, the operating expense ratio remained relatively stable, compared with 2014. In total, the pretax operating profit margin improved in 2015, compared with 2014. For 2016, we anticipate the pretax operating profit margin to be comparable with the 2015 and 2014 levels.


Aflac Japan Sales

The following table presents Aflac Japan's new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31.

The following table details the contributions to new annualized premium sales by major insurance product for the years ended December 31.

The foundation of Aflac Japan's product portfolio has been, and continues to be, our third sector cancer and medical products. Sales of third sector products increased

13.4%

in


, compared with the same period in


, exceeding the high end of our revised sales target range of 10% to 13%. We have been focusing more on promotion of our cancer and medical products in this low-interest-rate environment. These products are less interest-rate sensitive and more profitable compared to first sector products.

Sales of cancer insurance continued to be strong following the introduction at the end of the third quarter of 2014 of New Cancer DAYS, which includes an exclusive policy sold through Japan Post. Cancer insurance sales were up

40.6%

in 2015, compared with 2014. Aflac Japan enhanced its medical product with new riders in June 2015. This revision provides better protection against critical diseases such as cancer, heart attack and stroke. With continued cost pressure on Japan’s health care system, we expect the need for third sector products will continue to rise in the future, and we remain convinced that the medical and cancer products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio.

Aflac Japan’s first sector product sales, which include WAYS and child endowment, were

down

7.3%

in


, compared with


. We expect that for 2016, the sale of first sector products will continue to be down in comparison to 2015, as our focus remains on less interest-sensitive third sector products.

We remain committed to selling through our traditional channels. These channels, consisting of affiliated corporate agencies, independent corporate agencies and individual agencies, accounted for

85.1%

of total new annualized premium sales for Aflac Japan in


. In


, we recruited over


new sales agencies. At

December 31, 2015

, Aflac Japan was represented by more than

13,100

sales agencies and approximately

114,000

licensed sales associates employed by those agencies.

At

December 31, 2015

, we had agreements to sell our products at


banks, approximately

90%

of the total number of banks in Japan. Bank channel sales accounted for

14.9%

of new annualized premium sales in


for Aflac Japan, compared with

21.5%

in


.

Aflac Japan and Japan Post Holdings entered into a new agreement in July 2013, further expanding a partnership that was established in 2008 (see Japanese Regulatory Environment). At the end of June 2014, Japan Post Insurance(Kampo) received Financial Services Agency (FSA) regulatory approval to enter into an agency contract with Aflac Japan to begin distributing Aflac Japan's cancer insurance products at all of Kampo's 79 directly managed sales offices. Aflac Japan has developed a unique Aflac-branded cancer product for Japan Post and Kampo that was introduced on October


1, 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the number of postal outlets selling our cancer products expanded to approximately 10,000, and starting July 1, 2015, Japan Post expanded the number of post offices that offer Aflac's cancer products to more than 20,000 postal outlets. We believe this alliance with Japan Post will further benefit our cancer insurance sales.

We believe that there is still a continued need for our products in Japan. Our sales target and focus in 2016 will continue to be centered around the sale of Aflac Japan's third sector products, including cancer and medical. Although our traditional channels remain key to our success, we have developed partnerships with new channels to help increase our overall sales growth. These channels include Japan Post, and we are making steady progress with our sales through postal outlets. In 2016, we believe that third sector sales will be down mid-single digits in comparison to 2015. We believe that the long-term compound annual growth rate will be in the range of 4% to 6%.

Japanese Regulatory Environment

In 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing Japan's postal system (Japan Post) was enacted into law. The privatization laws split Japan Post into four operating entities that began operations in October 2007. In 2007, one of these entities selected Aflac Japan as its provider of cancer insurance to be sold through its post offices, and, in 2008, we began selling cancer insurance through these post offices. Japan Post has historically been a popular place for consumers to purchase insurance products. Legislation to reform the postal system passed the Diet in April 2012 and resulted in the merger of two of the postal operating entities (the one that delivers the mail and the one that runs the post offices) on October 1, 2012. In July 2013, Aflac Japan entered into a new agreement with Japan Post Holdings to further expand a partnership that was established in 2008 (see Aflac Japan Sales).

In June 2013, a revision to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act established a post-funded Orderly Resolution Regime for financial institutions to prevent a financial crisis in the event of a financial institution’s failure. This regime came into effect in March 2014, but is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's operations in Japan.

Aflac Japan Investments

The level of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations, the timing of investing the cash flow, yields on new investments, the effect of yen/dollar exchange rates on U.S. dollar-denominated investment income, and other factors.

Aflac Japan invests in U.S. dollar-denominated securities, including publicly-traded investment grade and below investment grade corporate fixed-maturity securities, and has entered into foreign currency forwards and options to hedge the currency risk on the fair value of the U.S. dollar securities. In 2015, as part of our normal portfolio management and asset allocation process, Aflac Japan increased the allocation of investments to a U.S. dollar senior secured bank loan program by approximately

$950 million

and to a U.S. dollar high yield corporate bond program by approximately

$650 million

, all of which had been funded as of December 31, 2015.

During the third and fourth quarters of 2015, we increased our investment in yen-denominated publicly traded equity securities, including new investments in exchange traded funds (ETFs) holding Japan real estate investment trusts. These securities are classified as available for sale and carried on our balance sheet at fair value. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our investment in yen-denominated publicly traded equity securities was

$485 million

.

See the Analysis of Financial Condition section of this MD&A for further discussion of these investment programs.

Funds available for investment include cash flows from operations, investment income, and funds generated from maturities, redemptions, securities lending, and other securities transactions. Securities lending is also used from time to time to accelerate the availability of funds for investment. Purchases of securities from period to period are determined based on multiple objectives including appropriate portfolio diversification, the relative value of a potential investment and availability of investment opportunities, liquidity, credit and other risk factors while adhering to our investment policy guidelines. Aflac Japan purchased debt security investments at an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately

663.6 billion

yen in


(approximately

$5.5 billion

),

1.0 trillion

yen in


(approximately

$10.0 billion

) and

2.5 trillion

yen in


(approximately

$25.4 billion

).

The following table presents the composition of debt security purchases by sector and equity security purchases for Aflac Japan, as a percentage of acquisition cost, for the years ended December 31.


Composition of Purchases by Sector

We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis. The ratings referenced in the two tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by the major credit rating agencies (Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P), and Fitch Ratings (Fitch)) or, if not rated, are determined based on our internal credit analysis of such securities. For investment-grade securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, we use the second lowest rating that is assigned. For a description of the ratings methodology that we use when a security is below investment grade or split-rated (one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade), see “Market Risks of Financial Instruments - Below-Investment-Grade and Split-Rated Securities” in the Analysis of Financial Condition section of this MD&A.

The distributions by credit rating of Aflac Japan's purchases of debt securities for the years ended December 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows:

Composition of Purchases by Credit Rating

The relatively higher AAA rated purchases in 2014 resulted from our decision to allocate part of our U.S. dollar securities allocation to U.S. Treasuries, in addition to our purchases of investment-grade corporate bonds. We sold these U.S. Treasuries later in 2014. The relatively higher purchases of AA rated securities in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the purchase of JGBs. The increase in purchases of A rated securities in 2015 was due primarily to the purchase of JBGs, which had been downgraded from AA to A in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in purchases of BBB rated securities in 2015 was due primarily to the purchase of U.S. dollar-denominated corporate securities. The significant increase in purchases of BB or lower rated securities during 2015 was due to increased investment in senior secured bank loans, most of which have below-investment-grade ratings, and investment in high yield corporate bonds. For more information on these investments, see the Credit Risk subsection of this MD&A.

The following table presents the results of Aflac Japan's investment yields for the years ended and as of December 31.

Yields are reported before the cost of the foreign currency forwards that hedge foreign exchange risk of U.S. dollar-denominated

publicly traded corporate bonds.

The new money yield in the table above excludes certain purchases of senior secured bank loans and high yield corporate bonds funded from the reinvestment of unplanned sales proceeds. The increase in the Aflac Japan new money yield in 2015 was primarily due to a large portion of 2015 new money being allocated to U.S. dollar-denominated investments rather than relatively low-yielding JGBs.

See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings.

The benefit ratio decreased in 2015, compared with 2014, due to mix of business changes and continued favorable claims experience. The expense ratio increased in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily due to increased spending


associated with changes in the Aflac U.S. sales structure. In total, the pretax operating profit margin remained stable in 2015, compared with 2014. In 2016, we expect the benefit and expense ratios to be relatively stable compared with 2015.

In


, our traditional U.S. sales forces included more than

9,200

U.S. associates who were actively producing business on a weekly basis. We believe that the average weekly producing sales associates metric allows our sales management to actively monitor progress and needs on a real-time basis. Beyond expanding the size and capabilities of our traditional sales force, we remain encouraged about establishing and developing relationships with insurance brokers that typically handle the larger-case market.

The addition of group products has expanded our reach and enabled us to generate more sales opportunities with larger employers, brokers, and our traditional sales agents. We anticipate that the appeal of our group products will continue to enhance our opportunities to connect with larger businesses and their employees. Our portfolio of group and individual products offers businesses the opportunity to give their employees a more valuable and comprehensive selection of benefit options.

We believe that changes we made to our career and broker management infrastructure over the last 18 months are laying the foundation for expanded long-term growth opportunities. During 2014, Aflac U.S. implemented tactical initiatives centered around providing competitive compensation to our career agent sales hierarchy and positioning us to more effectively and consistently execute on the U.S. sales strategy across all states. These measures are designed to more effectively link sales management's success to Aflac's success. For example, we enhanced compensation through an incentive bonus for the first level of our sales management, district sales coordinators, who are primarily responsible for selling Aflac products and training new sales associates. Additionally, we eliminated the commission-based position of state sales coordinator. To better manage our state operations, we introduced the new position of market director, effective October 1, 2014. Market directors are salaried with the opportunity to earn sales-related bonuses. We believe these changes have enhanced and will continue to enhance performance management and better align compensation with new business results.


One Day Pay

SM

is a claims initiative that we have focused on at Aflac U.S. to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just one day. We believe that along with our brand and relevant products, this claims practice will help Aflac stand out from competitors.

With the evolving business market and the coverage standardization that will result from health care reform in the United States, we believe Aflac's voluntary products will become more relevant than ever. Our products provide cash benefits that can be used to help with increasing out-of-pocket medical expenses, help cover household costs, or protect against income and asset loss. Our group products and relationships with insurance brokers that handle the larger-case market are helping us as we expand our reach selling to larger businesses. We are regularly evaluating the marketplace to identify opportunities to bring the most relevant, cost-effective products to our customers. We believe the need for our products remains very strong, and we continue to work on enhancing our distribution capabilities to access employers of all sizes, including initiatives that benefit our field force and the broker community. At the same time, we are seeking opportunities to leverage our brand strength and attractive product portfolio in the evolving health care environment. For


, our objective is for Aflac U.S. new annualized premium sales to increase

3%

to

5%

, with a long-term compound annual growth rate at or above the voluntary market growth rate of

U.S. Regulatory Environment

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is intended to give Americans of all ages and income levels access to comprehensive major medical health insurance. The major elements of the bill became effective on January 1, 2014. The primary subject of the legislation is major medical insurance; as enacted, the ACA does not materially affect the design of our insurance products. However, indirect consequences of the legislation and regulations, including uncertainty related to implementation, could present challenges and/or opportunities that could potentially have an impact on our sales model, financial condition and results of operations. Our experience with Japan’s national health care environment leads us to believe that the need for supplemental insurance will only increase over the coming years.

On December 18, 2015, the president signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act which included a revision to delay implementation of the Excise Tax on High Cost Plans, better known as the "Cadillac tax.” This tax was originally scheduled to begin in 2017, was previously delayed until 2018, and is now scheduled to begin in 2020. The tax consists of 40% of the cost of employer sponsored health coverage in excess of certain dollar thresholds. In general, only Aflac specified disease and fixed indemnity (i.e. supplemental health) products offered on a pre-tax basis are taken into account under this tax.

The legislation also makes the tax deductible by the payer. If employers fund coverage on a pre-tax basis, Aflac, as the insurer, would be liable for its pro-rata share of any tax on excess coverage, determined based on the cost of Aflac coverage compared to the total cost of the applicable health coverage in which each employee is enrolled. Making the tax deductible would then reduce the economic impact of any tax that is imposed and payable by Aflac.

Many employers are concerned about the tax and what impact it will have on benefit offerings in the future. There is confusion in the market about how the tax is calculated and who pays the tax, presenting a risk that some employers will mistakenly conclude that

all supplemental health products are included in the calculation for the tax regardless of pre-tax funding status or whether an employer’s health coverage exceeds the trigger for the tax. Some employers may decide simply to drop coverage of affected supplemental health products, rather than convert it to an after-tax basis. During this extended implementation period, Aflac will be assessing the impact of this tax; educating employers about the tax; and investigating ways to mitigate the impact of the tax. Having employees pay for the coverage on an after-tax basis would exempt affected supplemental health products from the tax.

The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in 2010, created, among other things, a Financial Stability Oversight Council (the Council). In April 2012, the Council released a final rule describing the general process it will follow in determining whether to designate a nonbank financial company for supervision by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (the Board). The Council may designate by a two-thirds vote whether certain nonbank financial companies, including certain insurance companies and insurance holding companies, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States, in which case such nonbank financial companies would become subject to prudential regulation by the Board. On April 3, 2013, the Board published a final rule that establishes the requirements for determining when a nonbank financial company is "predominantly engaged in financial activities" - a prerequisite for designation by the Council. Prudential regulation by the Board includes supervision of capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements and examinations. The Board may limit such company’s ability to enter into mergers, acquisitions and other business combination transactions, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate one or more activities, or impose conditions on the manner in which it conducts activities. The Council


designated two insurers in 2013 and an additional insurer in 2014 as a Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI). On December 18, 2014, the president signed the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act into law. This legislation will clarify the Board’s authority to apply insurance-based capital standards for insurance companies subject to federal supervision. Although Aflac is a nonbank financial company predominantly engaged in financial activities as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, we do not believe Aflac will be considered a company that poses a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations issued thereunder may have an impact on Aflac's derivative activity, including activity on behalf of Aflac Japan, in particular rules to require central clearing and collateral for certain types of derivatives. In 2014, the five U.S. banking regulators and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) re-proposed for comment their rules regarding collateral for uncleared swaps. Final rules were issued by the five U.S. banking regulators on October 22, 2015 and by the CFTC on December 16, 2015. Such rules may result in increased collateral requirements or affect other aspects of Aflac's derivatives activity.

The Dodd-Frank Act also established a FIO under the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance. Traditionally, U.S. insurance companies have been regulated primarily by state insurance departments. In December 2013, the FIO released a report entitled "How To Modernize And Improve The System Of Insurance Regulation In The United States." The report was required by the Dodd-Frank Act, and included 18 recommended areas of near-term reform for the states, including addressing capital adequacy and safety/soundness issues, reform of insurer resolution practices, and reform of marketplace regulation. The report also listed nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation. Some of the recommendations outlined in the FIO report released in December 2013 have been implemented. Of the nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation that are applicable to Aflac, the president signed the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act into law in January 2015, which simplifies the agent and broker licensing process across state lines. The FIO has also engaged with the supervisory colleges to monitor financial stability and identify regulatory gaps for large national and internationally active insurers.

The process of implementing the Dodd-Frank Act is ongoing and continues to involve additional rulemaking from time to time. At the current time, it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty what impact, if any, the Dodd-Frank Act will have on our U.S. business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Under state insurance guaranty association laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions, we are subject to assessments, based on the share of business we write in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. In the United States, some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. The Company's policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domicile's statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium upon which the assessment is based is written. In most states, the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction.

Penn Treaty Network Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company (collectively referred to as Penn Treaty) were placed in rehabilitation on January 6, 2009, and remained in rehabilitation as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we were unable to estimate when or to what extent Penn Treaty will ultimately be declared insolvent, or the amount of the insolvency. As such, we have not established any accruals for guaranty fund assessments associated with Penn Treaty as of December 31, 2015.

Aflac U.S. Investments

The level of investment income is affected by available cash flow from operations, the timing of investing the cash flow, yields on new investments, and other factors. Aflac U.S. has invested primarily in investment grade corporate bonds. In 2015, as part of our normal portfolio management and asset allocation process, Aflac U.S. purchased $120 million of high yield corporate bonds and

$118 million

of middle market loan receivables, of which $53 million was unfunded. As of

December 31, 2015

, we had commitments of

$182 million

to fund potential future loan originations related to the middle market loan investment program. These commitments are contingent upon the availability of middle market loans that meet our underwriting criteria. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a commercial mortgage loan investment program. As of December 31, 2015, we had

$10 million

in outstanding commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans, which had not yet been funded. These commitments are contingent on the final underwriting and due diligence to be performed, and may or may not be funded. See Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding loans and loans receivables. We are planning to invest in additional asset classes such as


securitized assets and alternative asset classes, all of which we believe will improve diversification and enhance long-term returns in 2016 and thereafter.

Funds available for investment include cash flows from operations, investment income, and funds generated from maturities, redemptions, and other securities transactions. Purchases of securities from period to period are determined based on multiple objectives, including appropriate portfolio diversification, the relative value of a potential investment and availability of investment opportunities, liquidity, credit and other risk factors while adhering to our investment policy guidelines. Aflac U.S. purchased debt security investments at an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately

$900 million

in


, compared with

$1.0 billion

in


and

$1.2 billion

in


. The following table presents the composition of debt security purchases by sector and other investment purchases for Aflac U.S., as a percentage of acquisition cost, for the years ended December 31.

Composition of Purchases by Sector

We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis. The ratings referenced in the two tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by the major credit rating agencies (Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) or, if not rated, are determined based on our internal credit analysis of such securities. For investment-grade securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, we use the second lowest rating that is assigned. For a description of the ratings methodology that we use when a security is below investment grade or split-rated (one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade), see “Market Risks of Financial Instruments - Below-Investment-Grade and Split-Rated Securities” in the Analysis of Financial Condition section of this MD&A.

The distributions by credit rating of Aflac's U.S. purchases of debt securities for the years ended December 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows:

Composition of Purchases by Credit Rating

The increase in purchases of BBB rated securities in 2015 was due primarily to the purchase of U.S. dollar-denominated corporate fixed-income publicly traded securities. The increase in purchases of BB or lower rated securities during 2015 was due to investment in high yield corporate bonds.

The following table presents the results of Aflac's U.S. investment yields for the years ended and as of December 31.

Market Risks of Financial Instruments

Our investment philosophy is to fulfill our fiduciary responsibility to invest assets in a prudent manner to meet the present and future needs of our policyholders' contractual obligations while maximizing the long-term financial return on assets consistent with the company goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value with defined risk appetites, limits,  and maintaining adequate liquidity.

The following table details investment securities by segment as of December 31.

Investment Securities by Segment

(1)

Excludes available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities held by the Parent Company and other business segments of

$523

in


and

$437

in


.

Because we invest primarily in fixed-maturity securities, our financial instruments are exposed primarily to three types of market risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk. In 2015, we increased our investment allocation to yen-denominated equity securities, thereby increasing our exposure to equity risk.

Currency Risk

The functional currency of Aflac Japan's insurance operations is the Japanese yen. All of Aflac Japan's premiums, claims and commissions are received or paid in yen, as are most of its other expenses. Most of Aflac Japan's cash and liabilities are yen-denominated. Aflac Japan's investments consisted of yen-denominated fixed income securities of

$60.8


billion

, at amortized cost, and yen-denominated equity securities of

$472 million

, at cost, at

December 31, 2015

. However, Aflac Japan also owns U.S. dollar-denominated fixed income securities of

$14.9 billion

, at amortized cost, whose fair value is hedged against currency risk as well as

$7.8 billion

of fixed income securities, at cost, that are not hedged. Aflac Japan owns U.S. dollar-denominated equity securities of

$4 million

, at cost, as of

December 31, 2015

. Yen-denominated investment income accounted for

50%

of Aflac Japan's investment income in


, with the remainder denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, Aflac Incorporated has yen-denominated debt obligations.

We are exposed to currency risk as an economic event only when yen funds are actually converted into dollars. This occurs when we repatriate yen-denominated funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S. The exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. A portion of the yen repatriation may be used to service Aflac Incorporated's yen-denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into dollars. In order to economically hedge foreign exchange risk for a portion of the profit repatriation received in yen from Aflac Japan, we had foreign exchange forwards and options as part of a hedging strategy on

30.0 billion

yen,

102.5 billion

yen,

25.0 billion

yen, and

85.0 billion

yen received in February 2015, July 2015, September 2015, and December 2015, respectively. As of

December 31, 2015

, we had foreign exchange forwards and options to economically hedge foreign exchange risk on

124.1 billion

yen of future profit repatriation from Aflac Japan.

In addition to profit repatriation, certain investment activities for Aflac Japan expose us to economic currency risk when yen are converted into dollars. As noted above, we invest a portion of our yen cash flows in U.S. dollar-denominated assets. This requires that we convert the yen cash flows to U.S. dollars before investing. As previously discussed, for certain of our U.S. dollar-denominated securities, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the currency risk on the fair value of the securities. The dollar coupon payments received on these investments are not hedged and are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations, which are realized in earnings. Also, Aflac Japan has invested in reverse-dual currency securities (RDCs, or yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments), which exposes Aflac to changes in foreign exchange rates. The foreign currency effect on the yen-denominated securities is accounted for as a component of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities in accumulated other comprehensive income, while the foreign currency effect on the dollar coupons is realized in earnings. The RDCs provided a higher yield at the time of purchase than those available on Japanese government or other public corporate bonds, while still adhering to our investment standards at the time of the transaction. The yen/dollar exchange rate would have to strengthen to approximately


before the yield on these instruments would equal that of a comparable JGB instrument.

Aside from the activities discussed above, we generally do not convert yen into dollars; however, we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. In periods when the yen weakens against the dollar, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. The weakening of the yen relative to the dollar will generally adversely affect the value of our yen-denominated investments in dollar terms. We attempt to minimize the exposure of shareholders' equity to foreign currency. We accomplish this by investing a portion of Aflac Japan's investment portfolio in U.S. dollar-denominated securities and by the Parent Company's issuance of yen-denominated debt (for additional information, see the discussion under the Hedging Activities subsection of MD&A). As a result, the effect of currency fluctuations on our net assets is reduced.

The following table demonstrates the effect of foreign currency fluctuations by presenting the dollar values of our yen-denominated assets and liabilities, and our consolidated yen-denominated net asset exposure at selected exchange rates as of December 31.


Dollar Value of Yen-Denominated Assets and Liabilities

at Selected Exchange Rates

Actual period-end exchange rate

Does not include the U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds for which we have entered into foreign currency derivatives as discussed in the Aflac Japan Investment subsection of MD&A

(3)

Does not include U.S. dollar-denominated bonds that have corresponding cross-currency swaps in consolidated VIEs

We are required to consolidate certain VIEs. Some of the consolidated VIEs in Aflac Japan's portfolio use foreign currency swaps to convert foreign denominated cash flows to yen, the functional currency of Aflac Japan, in order to minimize cash flow fluctuations. Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be periodic exchanges of payments at specified intervals based on the agreed upon rates and notional amounts. Prior to consolidation, our beneficial interest in these VIEs was a yen-denominated available-for-sale fixed maturity security. Upon consolidation, the  original yen-denominated investment was derecognized and the underlying fixed-maturity or perpetual securities and cross-currency swaps were recognized. The combination of a U.S. dollar-denominated investment and cross-currency swap economically creates a yen-denominated investment and has no impact on our net investment hedge position.

Similarly, the combination of the U.S. corporate bonds and the foreign currency forwards and options that we have entered into, as discussed in the Aflac Japan Investment subsection of MD&A, economically creates a yen-denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of our investment in Aflac Japan for net investment hedge purposes.


For additional information regarding our Aflac Japan net investment hedge, see the Hedging Activities subsection of MD&A.

Interest Rate Risk

Our primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt and perpetual securities. We monitor our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis utilizing a full valuation methodology, measuring price volatility, and sensitivity of the fair values of our investments to interest rate changes on the debt and perpetual securities we own. For example, if the current duration of a debt security or perpetual security is 10, then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately 10% if market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. Likewise, the fair value of the debt security or perpetual security will decrease by approximately 10% if market interest rates increase by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant.

The estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of debt and perpetual securities we own; derivatives, excluding credit default swaps, and notes payable as of December 31 follows:

Sensitivity of Fair Values of Financial Instruments

to Interest Rate Changes

(1)

Excludes capitalized lease obligations

There are various factors that affect the fair value of our investment in debt and perpetual securities. Included in those factors are changes in the prevailing interest rate environment, which directly affect the balance of unrealized gains or losses for a given period in relation to a prior period. Decreases in market yields generally improve the fair value of debt and perpetual securities, while increases in market yields generally have a negative impact on the fair value of our debt and perpetual securities. However, we do not expect to realize a majority of any unrealized gains or losses because we generally have the intent and ability to hold such securities until a recovery of value, which may be maturity. For additional information on unrealized losses on debt and perpetual securities, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. The following table presents the approximate duration of Aflac Japan's yen-denominated assets and liabilities, along with premiums, as of December 31.


The following table presents the approximate duration of Aflac U.S. dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, along with premiums, as of December 31.

The following table shows a comparison of average required interest rates for future policy benefits and investment yields, based on amortized cost, for the years ended December 31.

Comparison of Interest Rates for Future Policy Benefits

and Investment Yields

(Net of Investment Expenses)

(1)

Represents investments for Aflac Japan that support policy obligations and therefore excludes Aflac Japan’s annuity products

We continue to monitor the spread between our new money yield and the required interest assumption for newly issued products in both the United States and Japan and will re-evaluate those assumptions as necessary. Over the next two years, we have yen-denominated securities that will mature with yields in excess of Aflac Japan's current net investment yield of

2.82%

. These securities total

$723 million

at amortized cost and have a weighted average yield of

4.23%

. Currently, when debt and perpetual securities we own mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, adding riders to our older policies has helped offset negative investment spreads on these policies. Overall, adequate profit margins exist in Aflac Japan's aggregate block of business because of changes in the mix of business and favorable experience from mortality, morbidity and expenses.

Periodically, depending on general economic conditions, we may enter into derivative transactions to hedge interest rate risk.

For further information on interest rate derivatives, see Note 4 of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Credit Risk

A significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of debt securities or perpetual securities that expose us to the credit risk of the underlying issuer. We carefully evaluate this risk on every new investment and closely monitor the credit risk of our existing investment portfolio. We incorporate the needs of our products and liabilities, the overall requirements of the business, and other factors in addition to our underwriting of the credit risk for each investment in the portfolio.

Evaluating the underlying risks in our credit portfolio involves a multitude of factors including but not limited to our assessment of the issuers business activities, assets, products, market position, financial condition, and future prospects. We also must incorporate the assessment of the NRSROs in assigning credit ratings to our specific portfolio holdings. We perform extensive internal assessments of the credit risks for all our portfolio holdings and potential new investments.

The ratings of our securities referenced in the two tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by major NRSROs (Moody's, S&P and Fitch) or, if not rated, are determined based on our internal analysis of such securities. For investment-grade securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, we use the second lowest rating that is assigned. For a description of the ratings methodology that we use when a security is below


investment grade or split-rated, see "Market Risks of Financial Instruments - Below-Investment-Grade and Split-Rated Securities" in the Analysis of Financial Condition section of this MD&A.

The distributions by credit rating of our purchases of debt securities for the years ended December

31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows:

Composition of Purchases by Credit Rating

Purchases of securities from period to period are determined based on multiple objectives including appropriate portfolio diversification, the relative value of a potential investment and availability of investment opportunities, liquidity, credit and other risk factors while adhering to our investment policy guidelines. We did not purchase any perpetual securities during the periods presented in the table above. Total purchases comprise new money investments as well as the reinvestment of proceeds from investment disposals. The relatively higher purchases of AA rated securities in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the purchase of JGBs. The increase in purchases of A rated and BBB rated securities in 2015 was due primarily to the purchase of U.S. dollar-denominated corporate fixed-income publicly traded securities for the Aflac Japan portfolio. The significant increase in purchases of BB or lower rated securities in 2015 was due to increased investment in senior secured bank loans, most of which have below-investment-grade ratings, and investment in high yield corporate bonds. The bank loan investment program is managed externally by third party firms specializing in this asset class. This mandate requires a minimum average credit quality of BB-/Ba3, prohibits loan purchases rated below B/B2, and restricts exposure to any individual credit to less than 2% of the program’s assets. The objectives of this program include enhancing the yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates through the acquisition of floating rate assets. The objective of the high yield corporate bond investments is to enhance yield on invested assets and further diversify our credit risk. All investments must have a minimum rating of low BB using our above described rating methodology and are managed by our internal credit portfolio management team.

The distributions of debt and perpetual securities we own, by credit rating, as of December 31 were as follows:

Composition of Portfolio by Credit Rating

As of

December 31, 2015

, our direct and indirect exposure to securities in our investment portfolio that were guaranteed by third parties was immaterial both individually and in the aggregate.

Subordination Distribution

The majority of our total investments in debt and perpetual securities was senior debt at

December 31, 2015

and


. We also maintained investments in subordinated financial instruments that primarily consisted of Lower Tier II, Upper Tier II, and Tier I securities, listed in order of seniority. The Lower Tier II securities are debt instruments with fixed maturities. Our Upper Tier II and Tier I investments consisted of debt instruments with fixed maturities and perpetual securities, which have an economic maturity as opposed to a stated maturity.


The following table shows the subordination distribution of our debt and perpetual securities as of December 31.

For information regarding the amortized cost for our investments in debt and perpetual securities, the cost for equity securities and the fair values of these investments, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investment Concentrations

One of our largest sector concentrations as of

December 31, 2015

, was banks and financial institutions. Approximately

11%

and

14%

of our total portfolio of debt and perpetual securities, on an amortized cost basis, was in the bank and financial institution sector at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively. Within the countries we approve for investment opportunities, we primarily invest in financial institutions that are strategically crucial to each approved country's economy. The bank and financial institution sector is a highly regulated industry and plays a strategic role in the global economy. Within this sector, our credit risk by geographic region or country of issuer at

December 31, 2015

, based on amortized cost, was: Europe, excluding the United Kingdom (

28%

); United States (

26%

); Australia (

8%

); Japan (

8%

); United Kingdom (

9%

); and other (

21%

).


Our 15 largest global investment exposures as of

December 31, 2015

, were as follows:

Largest Global Investment Positions

(1)

JGBs or JGB-backed securities

As previously disclosed, we own long-dated debt instruments in support of our long-dated policyholder obligations. Some of our largest global investment holdings are positions that were purchased many years ago and increased in size due to merger and consolidation activity among the issuing entities. In addition, many of our largest holdings are yen-denominated, therefore strengthening of the yen can increase our position in dollars, and weakening of the yen can decrease our position in dollars. Our global investment guidelines establish concentration limits for our investment portfolios.

Geographical Exposure

The following table indicates the geographic exposure of our investment portfolio as of December 31.

Includes total exposure to Puerto Rico of

$1 million

of required deposits, of which

72%

has insurance of principal and interest.

European sovereign debt crisis

Since 2008, many countries in Europe, and specifically Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain (collectively the "peripheral Eurozone" countries), have experienced a debt crisis. Collective action by multiple parties including the European Central Bank (ECB), International Monetary Fund (IMF), European Council, and individual member states' governments had largely improved market perception of the situation across Europe. In exchange for this support, affected countries generally agreed to implement a series of measures to improve their fiscal situation in exchange for loans and other aid. Most countries continue to implement the prescribed austerity measures and have seen improvement in their economies, which in turn has seen their creditworthiness improve or stabilize.

The resolve to maintain the European Monetary Union (EMU) was tested in 2015 following the election of a new government in Greece, who rejected the requirements imposed in exchange for their previous support packages.  After a period of tense negotiations which threatened Greece’s ability to remain in the EMU, agreements were made which provided Greece additional aid in exchange for an updated set of requirements. These actions have stabilized the situation currently.


Although recent economic indicators show improvement from the depths of the crisis across most of the Eurozone, overall economic activity remains subdued throughout the region. To support the return to sustainable economic growth, the ECB has launched a quantitative easing (QE) stimulus program.

Since the crisis first began, we have taken steps to improve the risk profile of our portfolio by selling certain holdings throughout Europe, including the peripheral Eurozone countries.

The primary factor considered when determining the domicile of investment exposure is the legal country risk location of the issuer. However, other factors such as the location of the parent guarantor, the location of the company's headquarters or major business operations (including location of major assets), location of primary market (including location of revenue generation) and specific country risk publicly recognized by rating agencies can influence the assignment of the country (or geographic) risk location. When the issuer is a special financing vehicle or a branch or subsidiary of a global company, then we consider any guarantees and/or legal, regulatory and corporate relationships of the issuer relative to its ultimate parent in determining the proper assignment of country risk.

Investments in Certain European Countries - monitoring and mitigating exposure

Our internal team of experienced credit professionals has continued to monitor the impact of the European sovereign crisis on our individual investment holdings' overall credit quality. Our analysis includes factors beyond a baseline assessment of a company's assets, operations, financial statements, and credit metrics that may provide support for the instruments we own. Specifically, for our investments in European banks and financial institutions, we monitor the importance of the issuer to its local financial system, the likelihood of government support, and our investment's position in the capital structure of the issuer. For our investments in European utilities, we monitor the role of the issuer in its local economy as a provider of necessary infrastructure, and we monitor the value of the underlying assets owned by the issuer. For our investment in European corporates, industrials, and other commercial entities, we monitor the general credit quality of the issuer, the geographical mix of the issuer's customers (i.e. domestic vs. foreign), the geographical breakdown of the issuer's assets (i.e. domestic versus foreign), the value of the underlying assets owned by the issuer, capitalization of the issuer, and overall profitability and cash generation ability of the issuer. We monitor NRSRO actions and the likely actions for our investment exposures, as well as overall market conditions. By performing these analyses, we make a determination on the probability of timely payment of principal and interest of the issuers of our investments.

Some of our peripheral Eurozone fixed-maturity investments contain covenants that we believe mitigate our risk to the issuer. These covenants could include put options that allow us to return our holdings to the issuer at a predetermined price, usually par, should the issuer be downgraded to below investment grade by a rating agency. Additionally, these covenants may include restrictions on the ability of the issuer to incur additional debt, sell assets, or provide collateral for indebtedness. As of

December 31, 2015

, all of the issuers of our holdings from peripheral Eurozone countries were current on their obligations to us, and we believe they have the ability to meet their obligations to us.

As of

December 31, 2015

, our investments in peripheral Eurozone countries totaled

$2.8 billion

, or

2.9%

of our total debt and perpetual securities, at amortized cost. We have no direct exposure to Greece. Apart from our direct investments in peripheral Eurozone sovereign debt totaling

$262 million

, our other exposures as of

December 31, 2015

to the European sovereign debt crisis were investments in peripheral Eurozone banks and financial institutions of

$488 million

, peripheral Eurozone non-banks (excluding sovereigns) of

$2.0 billion

, core Eurozone


banks and financial institutions of

$1.7 billion

, core Eurozone non-banks (excluding sovereigns) of

$4.2 billion

, core Eurozone sovereigns of

$486 million

, and non-Eurozone


holdings throughout the balance of Europe of

$5.0 billion

, all at amortized cost. Other investment risks stemming from the European sovereign debt crisis that are not possible to measure and include the impact of slower economic activity throughout Europe and its impact on global economic growth and market disruption including illiquidity and impaired valuations due to heightened concerns and lack of investor confidence.

Although the situation had largely stabilized across Europe, the crisis in Greece that re-emerged in mid-2015 demonstrates certain risks remain as the area continues working to improve its economic footing.  We continue to monitor the situation closely including the heightened interrelationship between political, monetary, fiscal, and economic forces; the pace of underlying structural reforms; the possibility of continued contagion to additional sovereigns and other entities; further stress on the banking systems throughout the region; and the impact on the underlying economic fundamentals throughout the Eurozone.


Core Eurozone includes Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Finland and Luxembourg.


Non-Eurozone Europe includes the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Czech Republic and Poland.


Oil and Gas Exposure

As a result of the large decline in oil prices, there has been heightened attention to certain investments in the various energy sub-sectors related to oil and gas following a large increase in market volatility. Our portfolio includes holdings diversified across multiple sub-sectors of the oil and gas industry, spread among multiple geographies. The following table shows the breakout of our exposure to the oil and gas industry as of December 31.

As of December 31, 2015, the weighted-average rating of our total fixed maturity oil and gas exposure is BBB, and 93% of this exposure is investment grade. Absent a major change in the outlook for oil prices, we expect the increase in market volatility surrounding these issuers to continue. This could lead to increased negative ratings activity from the public rating agencies for energy-related credit issuers. We do not currently expect our investments in these sub-sectors related to oil and gas to have a material impact on our results of operations.

Securities by Type of Issuance

We have investments in both publicly and privately issued securities. Our ability to sell either type of security is a function of overall market liquidity which is impacted by, among other things, the amount of outstanding securities of a particular issuer or issuance, trading history of the issue or issuer, overall market conditions, and idiosyncratic events affecting the specific issue or issuer.

The following table details investment securities by type of issuance as of December 31.


Investment Securities by Type of Issuance

The following table details our privately issued investment securities as of December 31.

Privately Issued Securities

Reverse-Dual Currency Securities

(1)

Principal payments in yen and interest payments in dollars

Aflac Japan has invested in privately issued securities to better match liability characteristics and secure higher yields than those available on Japanese government or other public corporate bonds. All of the yen-denominated privately issued securities we have purchased were rated investment grade at the time of purchase

.

Aflac Japan’s investments in yen-denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non-Japanese issuers and have longer maturities, thereby allowing us to improve our asset/liability matching and our overall investment returns. These securities were generally either privately negotiated arrangements or were issued under medium-term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings of the issuer, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and/or event-risk covenants were required. Many of these investments have protective covenants appropriate to the specific investment. These may include a prohibition of certain activities by the borrower, maintenance of certain financial measures, and specific conditions impacting the payment of our notes.

Below-Investment-Grade and Split-Rated Securities

We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. The ratings referenced in the tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by the major credit rating agencies (Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) or, if not rated, are determined based on our internal credit analysis of such securities. When the ratings issued by the rating agencies differ, we utilize the second lowest rating, regardless of how many of the three rating agencies actually rated the instrument. Split-rated securities are those where the ratings are not equivalent and one


or more of the ratings is investment grade and one or more is below investment grade. For these split-rated securities, if there are only two ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies, we take the lower below-investment-grade rating. If there are three ratings assigned, and two of the three are below investment grade, we consider it a below-investment-grade security. If there are three ratings and two are investment grade, we consider it an investment grade security unless our evaluation and assessment shows a below-investment-grade rating is warranted despite two of the three rating agencies rating it investment grade.

Our portfolio of below-investment-grade securities includes debt securities purchased while the issuer was rated investment grade plus other loans and bonds purchased as part of an allocation to that segment of the market. The following is our below-investment-grade exposure in accordance with the above described rating methodology as of December 31.


Below-Investment-Grade Securities

We invest in senior secured bank loans primarily to U.S. corporate borrowers, most of which have below-investment-grade ratings. The program is managed externally by third party firms specializing in this asset class. This mandate requires a minimum average credit quality of BB-/Ba3, prohibits loan purchases rated below B/B2, and prohibits exposure to any individual credit greater than 2% of the program’s assets. The objectives of this program include enhancing the


yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates through the acquisition of floating rate assets. Our investments in this program totaled

$1.4 billion

at

December 31, 2015

, compared with

$501 million

at

December 31, 2014

, on an amortized cost basis.

In 2015, as part of our normal portfolio management and asset allocation process, we increased our allocation to higher yielding corporate bonds by approximately

$644 million

within the Aflac Japan portfolio and

$120 million

within the Aflac U.S. portfolio. Most of these securities were rated below-investment-grade at the time of purchase, but we also purchased several that are currently rated investment grade which, because of market pricing, offer yields commensurate with below-investment-grade risk profiles. The objective of this allocation is to enhance our yield on invested assets and further diversify our credit risk. All investments must have a minimum rating of low BB using our above described rating methodology and are managed by our internal credit portfolio management team.

Excluding the senior secured bank loans and certain high yield corporate bonds discussed above that were rated below investment grade when initially purchased, below-investment-grade debt and perpetual securities represented

3.1%

of total debt and perpetual securities at

December 31, 2015

, compared with

3.4%

at

December 31, 2014

, on an amortized cost basis. Debt and perpetual securities classified as below investment grade at

December 31, 2015

and


were generally reported as available for sale and carried at fair value.

For the foreign currency and credit default swaps associated with our VIE investments for which we are the primary beneficiary, we bear the risk of foreign exchange and/or credit loss due to counterparty default even though we are not a direct counterparty to those contracts. We are a direct counterparty to the foreign currency swaps that we have on certain of our senior notes and subordinated debentures; foreign currency forwards; foreign currency options; and interest rate swaptions, therefore we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties in those contracts. The risk of counterparty default for our VIE and senior note and subordinated debenture swaps, foreign currency forwards and options, and swaptions is mitigated by collateral posting requirements the counterparty must meet. If collateral posting agreements are not in place, the counterparty risk associated with foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options is the risk that at expiry of the contract, the counterparty is unable to deliver the agreed upon amount of yen at the agreed upon price or delivery date, thus exposing the company to additional unhedged exposure to U.S. dollars in the Aflac Japan investment portfolio. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.


Equity Risk

Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. These fluctuations could impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Other-than-temporary Impairment

See Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our impairment policy.

Unrealized Investment Gains and Losses

The following table provides details on amortized cost, fair value and unrealized gains and losses for our investments in fixed maturities, perpetual securities, and equity securities by investment-grade status as of

Aging of Unrealized Losses

The following table presents a distribution of unrealized losses on fixed maturities, perpetual securities, and equity securities by magnitude as of

December 31, 2015

.


Percentage Decline From Amortized Cost

The following table presents the 10 largest unrealized loss positions in our portfolio as of

December 31, 2015

.

Generally, declines in fair values can be a result of changes in interest rates, yen/dollar exchange rate, and changes in net spreads driven by a broad market move or a change in the issuer's underlying credit quality. In the fourth quarter of 2015, market volatility increased markedly, especially in the energy and commodity-related sectors. Most of the declines noted above are related to issuers in those sectors. As we believe these issuers have the ability to continue making timely payments of principal and interest, we view these changes in fair value to be temporary and do not believe it is necessary to impair the carrying value of these securities. See the Unrealized Investment Gains and Losses section in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of unrealized losses related to financial institutions, including perpetual securities, and other corporate investments.

Investment Valuation and Cash

We estimate the fair values of our securities on a monthly basis. We monitor the estimated fair values obtained from our custodian, pricing vendors and brokers for consistency from month to month, while considering current market conditions. We also periodically discuss with our custodian and pricing brokers and vendors the pricing techniques they use to monitor the consistency of their approach and periodically assess the appropriateness of the valuation level assigned to the values obtained from them. If a fair value appears unreasonable, we will re-examine the inputs and assess the reasonableness of the pricing data with the vendor. Additionally, we may compare the inputs to relevant market indices and other performance measurements. The output of this analysis is presented to the Company's Valuation and Classifications Subcommittee, or VCS. Based on the analysis provided to the VCS, the valuation is confirmed or may be revised if there is evidence of a more appropriate estimate of fair value based on available market data. We have performed verification of the inputs and calculations in any valuation models to confirm that the valuations represent reasonable estimates of fair value.

For those investments accounted for as loan receivables, we record those investments at amortized cost on the acquisition date and carry at adjusted amortized cost. The adjusted amortized cost of the loan receivables reflects


allowances for expected incurred losses estimated based on past events and current economic conditions as of each reporting date. See the Loans and Loan Receivables section in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these investments.

Cash and cash equivalents totaled

Notes Payable

Notes payable totaled

$5.0 billion

at

December 31, 2015

, compared with

$5.3 billion

at

December 31, 2014

.

In August 2015, we paid off $300 million of 3.45% fixed-rate senior notes upon their maturity and paid off a 5.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $41 million using the exchange rate at the specific maturity date). In July 2015, we paid off a 10.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $81 million using the exchange rate at the specific maturity date).

In March 2015, the Parent Company issued two series of senior notes totaling $1.0 billion through a U.S. public debt offering. The first series, which totaled $550 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.40% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a five-year maturity. The second series, which totaled $450 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.25% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a ten-year maturity. We have entered into cross-currency swaps that convert the U.S. dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes into yen-denominated obligations which results in lower nominal net interest rates on the debt. By entering into these cross-currency swaps, we economically converted our $550 million liability into a 67.0 billion yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from 2.40% in dollars to .24% in yen, and we economically converted our $450 million liability into a 55.0 billion yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from 3.25% in dollars to .82% in yen. In April 2015, the Parent Company used the proceeds from the March 2015 issuance of its fixed-rate senior notes to redeem all of our $850 million 8.50% fixed-rate senior notes


due May 2019 and to pay a portion of the corresponding $230 million make-whole premium due to the investors of these notes.

See Note 9 of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our notes payable.

Benefit Plans

Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. have various benefit plans. For additional information on our Japanese and U.S. plans, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Policyholder Protection

The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. Legislation enacted regarding the framework of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC) included government fiscal measures supporting the LIPPC. On December 27, 2011, Japan's FSA announced the plans to enhance the stability of the LIPPC by extending the government's fiscal support of the LIPPC through March 2017. Accordingly, the FSA submitted legislation to the Diet on January 27, 2012 to extend the government's fiscal support framework, and the legislation was approved on March 30, 2012. Effective April 2014, the annual LIPPC contribution amount for the total life industry was lowered from 40 billion yen to 33 billion yen. Aflac Japan paid

2.2 billion

yen in both 2015 and 2014 and

2.3 billion

yen in 2013 for the policyholder protection fund.

Hedging Activities

Net Investment Hedge

Our primary exposure to be hedged is our investment in Aflac Japan, which is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. To mitigate this exposure, we have taken the following courses of action. First, Aflac Japan maintains certain unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. Second, we have designated the majority of the Parent Company’s yen-denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes) as non-derivative hedging instruments and certain foreign currency forwards and options as derivative hedges of our net investment in Aflac Japan. We make our net investment hedge designation at the beginning of each quarter. If the total of the designated Parent Company non-derivative and derivatives notional is equal to or less than our net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective, and the exchange effect on the yen-denominated liabilities and the change in estimated fair value of the derivatives are reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. We estimate that if the designated net investment hedge positions exceeded our net investment in Aflac Japan by 10 billion yen, we would report a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $1 million for every 1% yen weakening/strengthening in the end-of-period yen/dollar exchange rate. Our net investment hedge was effective during the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


.

The yen net asset figure calculated for hedging purposes differs from the yen-denominated net asset position as discussed in the Currency Risk subsection of MD&A. As disclosed in that subsection, the consolidation of the underlying assets in certain VIEs requires that we derecognize our yen-denominated investment in the VIE and recognize the underlying fixed-maturity or perpetual securities and cross-currency swaps. While these U.S. dollar investments will create foreign currency fluctuations, the combination of the U.S. dollar-denominated investment and the cross-currency swap economically creates a yen-denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of our investment in Aflac Japan. Similarly, the combination of the U.S. corporate bonds and the foreign currency forwards and options that we have entered into, as discussed in the Aflac Japan Investment subsection of MD&A, economically creates a yen-denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of our investment in Aflac Japan.

The dollar values of our yen-denominated net assets, including economic yen-denominated investments for net investment hedging purposes as discussed above, are summarized as follows (translated at end-of-period exchange rates) for the years ended December 31:


For the hedge of our net investment in Aflac Japan, we have designated certain of the Parent Company's yen-denominated liabilities, certain unhedged U.S. dollar investments and foreign currency forwards and options as a hedge of our net investment in Aflac Japan. Our consolidated yen-denominated net asset position was partially hedged at

$1.2 billion

as of

December 31, 2015

, compared with

$1.6 billion

as of

December 31, 2014

.

Cash Flow Hedges

We had freestanding derivative instruments related to our consolidated VIE investments that are reported in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets and other liabilities. As of

December 31, 2015

, two of the freestanding swaps that are used within VIEs to hedge the risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates qualified for hedge accounting.

Fair Value Hedges

We have entered into foreign currency forwards and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with new investments in U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-maturities that support yen-denominated liabilities within our Aflac Japan segment.

At times we have entered into interest rate swaptions to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with our U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-maturities that support yen-denominated liabilities within our Aflac Japan segment.

See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our hedging activities.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of

December 31, 2015

, we had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on material unconditional purchase obligations that are not recorded on our balance sheet.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the Parent Company through dividends and management fees. The following table presents the amounts provided for the years ended December 31.

Liquidity Provided by Aflac to Parent Company

The primary uses of cash by the Parent Company are shareholder dividends, the repurchase of its common stock, interest on its outstanding indebtedness and operating expenses. The Parent Company's sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and are not expected to change materially in the future. For additional information, see the Financing Activities subsection of this MD&A.

The Parent Company also accesses debt security markets to provide additional sources of capital. We filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in May 2015 that allows us to issue an indefinite amount of senior and subordinated debt, in one or more series, from time to time until May 2018. In March 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with Japanese regulatory authorities that allows us to issue up to 100 billion yen of yen-denominated Samurai notes in Japan through March 2016. If issued, these yen-denominated Samurai notes would not be available to U.S. persons. We believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available. For additional information, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are premiums and investment income. The primary uses of cash by our insurance operations are investments, policy claims, commissions, operating expenses, income taxes and payments to the Parent Company for management fees and dividends. Both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable.


When making an investment decision, our first consideration is based on product needs. Our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment-grade debt securities. These objectives also take into account duration matching, and because of the long-term nature of our business, we have adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs.

As a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. Therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. We expect our future cash flows from premiums and our investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for benefits and expenses.

In October 2015, the Parent Company and Aflac jointly entered into a 364-day uncommitted bilateral line of credit that provides for borrowings in the amount of

$100 million

.

Borrowings will bear interest at the rate quoted by the bank and agreed upon at the time of making such loan and will have a three-month maturity period.

There are no related facility fees, upfront expenses or financial covenant requirements. Borrowings under this credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the financing agreement will mature no later than three months after the last drawdown date of October 15, 2016. As of

December 31, 2015

, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our

$100 million

credit agreement.

In September 2015, we amended and restated our 50.0 billion yen senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement, due to expire in March 2018, pursuant to which the Parent Company and Aflac jointly entered into a new five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that provides for borrowings of up to 55.0 billion yen or the equivalent of yen in U.S. dollars on a revolving basis. Borrowings bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a eurocurrency rate determined by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds effective rate plus ½ of 1%, (2) the rate of interest for such day announced by Mizuho Bank, Ltd. as its prime rate and (3) the eurocurrency rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin.  The applicable margin ranges between .79% and 1.275% for eurocurrency rate borrowings and .0% and .275% for base rate borrowings, depending on the Parent Company’s debt ratings as of the date of determination.  In addition, the Parent Company and Aflac are required to pay a facility fee on the commitments ranging between .085% and .225%, also based on the Parent Company’s debt ratings as of the date of determination.  Borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including a capital contingency plan for the operations of the Parent Company and Aflac.  The amended and restated credit facility requires compliance with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis and will expire on the earlier of (a) September 18, 2020, or (b) the date the commitments are terminated pursuant to an event of default, as such term is defined in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our 55.0 billion yen revolving credit agreement.

In February 2015, the Parent Company and Aflac jointly entered into an uncommitted bilateral line of credit with a third party that provides for borrowings in the amount of $50 million. Borrowings will bear interest at the rate quoted by the bank and agreed upon at the time of making such loan and will have a three-month maturity period. There are no related facility fees, upfront expenses or financial covenant requirements. Borrowings under this credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our $50 million credit agreement.

Our financial statements convey our financing arrangements during the periods presented. We have not engaged in material intra-period short-term financings during the periods presented that are not otherwise reported in our balance sheet. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable and lines of credit at

December 31, 2015

. We have not entered into transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase financial assets that have been accounted for as a sale under applicable accounting standards, including securities lending transactions. See Notes 1, 3, and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our securities lending and derivative activities. With the exception of disclosed activities in those referenced footnotes, we do not have a known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that would reasonably result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing by a material amount. Our cash and cash equivalents include unrestricted cash on hand, money market instruments, and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased, all of which has minimal market, settlement or other risk exposure.

The following table presents the estimated payments by period of our major contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2015

. We translated our yen-denominated obligations using the

December 31, 2015

, exchange rate.  Actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate.


Distribution of Payments by Period

Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of

$15

have been excluded from the tabular disclosure above because the timing of cash payment is not reasonably estimable.

(1)

Liability amounts are those reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of

December 31, 2015

.

(2)

The estimated payments due by period reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits. These projected cash outflows are based on assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality, morbidity, and other assumptions comparable with our experience, consider future premium receipts on current policies in force, and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs. These cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and, as a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of

$234,854

exceeds the corresponding liability amount of

$69,687

. We have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, actual cash outflow amounts and timing will differ, possibly materially, from these estimates.

(3)

Includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims. Actual amounts and timing of unpaid policy claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above.

(4)

Not applicable

For more information on our major contractual obligations, see the applicable Note in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as indicated in the line items in the table above.

Consolidated Cash Flows

We translate cash flows for Aflac Japan's yen-denominated items into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. In years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported.

The following table summarizes consolidated cash flows by activity for the years ended December 31.

Operating Activities

Consolidated cash flow from operations increased

3.5%

in


, compared with


. The following table summarizes operating cash flows by source for the years ended December 31.


The decrease in Aflac Japan operating cash flows during 2015 and 2014 was largely due to a decline in the sales of the WAYS product which resulted in a reduced amount of cash received from discounted advance premiums.

Investing Activities

Operating cash flow is primarily used to purchase debt securities to meet future policy obligations. The following table summarizes investing cash flows by source for the years ended December 31.

Prudent portfolio management dictates that we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. Currently, when our fixed-maturity securities and perpetual securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, the long-term nature of our business and our strong cash flows provide us with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and/or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. When needed or when market opportunities arise, we dispose of selected fixed-maturity and perpetual securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities, improve future investment yields, and/or re-balance our portfolio. As a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year. Dispositions before maturity were approximately

5%

of the annual average investment portfolio of fixed maturities and perpetual securities available for sale during the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared with

6%

in


and

16%

in


.

Financing Activities

Consolidated cash used by financing activities was

$2.2 billion

in


and

$147 million

in


, compared with cash provided by financing activities of

$1.1 billion

in


.

In August 2015, we paid off $300 million of 3.45% fixed-rate senior notes upon their maturity. In August 2015, we paid off a 5.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $41 million using the exchange rate at the maturity date). In July 2015, we paid off a 10.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $81 million using the exchange rate at the maturity date).

In March 2015, the Parent Company issued two series of senior notes totaling $1.0 billion through a U.S. public debt offering. The first series, which totaled $550 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.40% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a five-year maturity. The second series, which totaled $450 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.25% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a ten-year maturity. We have entered into cross-currency swaps that convert the U.S. dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes into yen-denominated obligations which results in lower nominal net interest rates on the debt. By entering into these cross-currency swaps, we economically converted our $550 million liability into a 67.0 billion yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from 2.40% in dollars to .24% in yen, and we economically converted our $450 million liability into a 55.0 billion yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from 3.25% in dollars to .82% in yen. In April 2015, the Parent Company used $1.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes that were issued in March 2015 to redeem all of our $850 million 8.50% fixed-rate senior notes due May 2019 and to pay a portion of the corresponding $230 million make-whole premium due to the investors of these notes. We consider the make-whole payment a non-recurring transaction and therefore excluded this charge from operating earnings.

In November 2014, the Parent Company issued $750 million of senior notes through a U.S. public debt offering. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In July 2014, we redeemed 28.7 billion yen of our fixed rate Samauri notes and 5.5 billion yen of our variable rate Samurai notes upon their maturity (a total of approximately $335 million using the exchange rate on the date of redemption).

In June 2013, the Parent Company issued $700 million of senior notes through a U.S. public debt offering. We used part of these net proceeds for the debt redemptions in 2014. The balance of the net proceeds were used to repay or redeem, in whole or in part, the Parent Company’s $300 million senior notes that were due August 2015 and for general corporate purposes.


See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the debt issuances discussed above.

Cash returned to shareholders through dividends and treasury stock purchases was

See our preceding discussion in this Capital Resources and Liquidity section of MD&A regarding the 364-day uncommitted bilateral line of credit entered into by the Parent Company and Aflac in October 2015 in the amount of $100 million; the five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement entered into by the Parent Company and Aflac in September 2015 in the amount of 55 billion yen; and the $50 million uncommitted bilateral line of credit entered into by the Parent Company and Aflac in February 2015. As of

December 31, 2015

, no borrowings were outstanding under these lines of credit.

We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable and lines of credit at

December 31, 2015

Regulatory Restrictions

Aflac is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to its regulations. The Nebraska Department of Insurance imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent Company. Under Nebraska insurance law, prior approval of the Nebraska Department of Insurance is required for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. These regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by Aflac to the Parent Company. A life insurance company’s statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the NAIC, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from U.S. GAAP and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. Similar laws apply in New York and South Carolina, the domiciliary jurisdictions of the Parent Company's other insurance subsidiaries, Aflac New York and CAIC.

The continued long-term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations. Aflac’s insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings, equity contributions by the Parent Company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings, or reinsurance transactions. The NAIC’s risk-based capital (RBC) formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies. The RBC formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer’s operations. Aflac's company action level RBC ratio was

933%

as of

December 31, 2015

, compared with 945% at December 31, 2014. Aflac's RBC ratio remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. As of

December 31, 2015

, Aflac's total adjusted capital of

$11.7 billion

exceeded the company action level required capital and surplus of

$1.3 billion

by

$10.4 billion

. The maximum amount of dividends that can be paid to the Parent Company by Aflac without prior approval of Nebraska's director of insurance is the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. Dividends declared by Aflac during


in excess of

$2.3 billion

would require such approval. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the impact of permitted practices by the Nebraska Department of Insurance on our statutory capital and surplus. The NAIC considers its Solvency Modernization Initiative (SMI) process relating to updating the U.S. insurance solvency regulation framework to be ongoing. The SMI has focused on key issues such as capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, reinsurance, statutory accounting and financial reporting matters. Many of these key issues have been finalized and/or are near completion; however, the NAIC still has some ongoing initiatives related to SMI, such as monitoring the international efforts on group capital requirements and group supervision as well as risk-based capital.

In addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by U.S. insurance regulators, Japan’s FSA may not allow profit repatriations from Aflac Japan if the transfers would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders. The FSA maintains its own solvency standard which is quantified through the solvency margin ratio (SMR). Aflac Japan's SMR is sensitive to interest rate, credit spread and foreign exchange rate changes, therefore we continue to evaluate alternatives for reducing this sensitivity. In the event of a rapid change in market factors (such as interest rates), we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of 55 billion yen and a committed reinsurance facility in the amount of approximately 110 billion yen as capital contingency plans (see Notes 8 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). We have already undertaken measures to mitigate the sensitivity of Aflac Japan's SMR. For example, we employ policy reserve matching (PRM), which is a Japan-specific accounting treatment that reduces SMR interest rate sensitivity since PRM-designated investments are carried at amortized cost consistent with corresponding liabilities. For U.S. GAAP, PRM investments are categorized as available for sale. In the first quarter of 2015, Aflac Japan entered into a quota share arrangement to cede a portion of hospital benefits of one of our closed products. Under this coinsurance indemnity type of reinsurance, Aflac Japan released approximately 130 billion yen of FSA reserves. (See Notes 3, 4 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our investment strategies, hedging activities, and reinsurance, respectively.) As of

December 31, 2015

, Aflac Japan's SMR was

828%

, compared with

857%

at

December 31, 2014

.

Aflac is subject to the NAIC’s Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA), effective January 1, 2015. Through the ORSA requirements, Aflac is expected to regularly, no less than annually, conduct an ORSA to assess the adequacy of its risk management framework, and its current and estimated projected future solvency position; internally document the process and results of the assessment; and provide a confidential high-level ORSA Summary Report annually to the lead state commissioner if the insurer is a member of an insurance group. Aflac filed its ORSA report on November 20, 2015 with the Nebraska Department of Insurance.


Payments are made from Aflac Japan to the Parent Company for management fees and to Aflac U.S. for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings. The following table details Aflac Japan remittances for the years ended December 31.

Aflac Japan Remittances

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we began to increase the frequency of capital transfers from Japan to the United States to better manage cash flow. This capital repatriation is reflected in Aflac Japan's SMR as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

We entered into foreign exchange forwards and options as part of an economic hedge on foreign exchange risk on 242.5 billion yen of profit repatriation received in 2015, resulting in $71 million of additional funds received when the yen were exchanged into dollars.

For additional information on regulatory restrictions on dividends, profit repatriations and other transfers, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. Based on our evaluation under this framework, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2015

.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

, which is included herein.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Aflac Incorporated:

We have audited Aflac Incorporated's (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Aflac Incorporated's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Aflac Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2015

and


, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2015

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries as of

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business

Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The Company's insurance business is marketed and administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). American Family Life Assurance Company of New York (Aflac New York) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Aflac. Most of Aflac's policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Additionally, Aflac U.S. markets and administers group products through Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC), branded as Aflac Group Insurance. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business. Aflac Japan's revenues, including realized gains and losses on its investment portfolio, accounted for

70%

of the Company's total revenues in


, compared with

72%

and

74%

Basis of Presentation

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  These principles are established primarily by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). In these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, references to U.S. GAAP issued by the FASB are derived from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification

TM

(ASC). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates when recording transactions resulting from business operations based on currently available information. The most significant items on our balance sheet that involve a greater degree of accounting estimates and actuarial determinations subject to changes in the future are the valuation of investments, deferred policy acquisition costs, liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, and income taxes. These accounting estimates and actuarial determinations are sensitive to market conditions, investment yields, mortality, morbidity, commission and other acquisition expenses, and terminations by policyholders. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates will be revised and reflected in operating results. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, we believe the amounts provided are adequate.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company, its subsidiaries and those entities required to be consolidated under applicable accounting standards.  All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Significant Accounting Policies

Translation of Foreign Currencies:

The functional currency of Aflac Japan's insurance operations is the Japanese yen. We translate our yen-denominated financial statement accounts into U.S. dollars as follows. Assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period exchange rates. Realized gains and losses on security transactions are translated at the exchange rate on the trade date of each transaction. Other revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated using average exchange rates for the period. The resulting currency translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. We include in earnings the realized currency exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions.

Prior to October 1, 2013, Aflac Japan maintained an investment portfolio of U.S. dollar-denominated securities on behalf of Aflac U.S., which served as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. The functional currency for these investments was the U.S. dollar. The related investment income and realized/unrealized investment gains and losses were denominated in U.S. dollars. Since the functional currency of this portfolio was the U.S. dollar, there was no translation adjustment to record in other comprehensive income for these investments when the yen/dollar exchange rate changed. The foreign exchange gains and losses related to this portfolio continue to be taxable in Japan and the U.S. when the securities matured or were sold. Until maturity or sale, deferred tax expense or benefit associated with the foreign exchange gains or losses is recognized in income tax expense on other comprehensive income. As of October 1, 2013, these investments were transferred into the Aflac Japan investment portfolio. These investments began to have remeasurement and translation effects recorded in other comprehensive income in the fourth quarter of 2013.


We have designated a majority of the Parent Company's yen-denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes and yen-denominated loans) as non-derivative hedges and designated foreign currency forwards and options as derivative hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investment in Aflac Japan. Outstanding principal and related accrued interest on these Parent Company liabilities and the fair value of these derivatives are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Currency translation adjustments and changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded as unrealized foreign currency translation gains (losses) in other comprehensive income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Insurance Revenue and Expense Recognition:

The supplemental health and life insurance policies we issue are classified as long-duration contracts. The contract provisions generally cannot be changed or canceled during the contract period; however, we may adjust premiums for supplemental health policies issued in the United States within prescribed guidelines and with the approval of state insurance regulatory authorities.

Insurance premiums for most of the Company's health and life policies are recognized ratably as earned income over the premium payment periods of the policies. When revenues are reported, the related amounts of benefits and expenses are charged against such revenues, so that profits are recognized in proportion to premium revenues during the period the policies are expected to remain in force. This association is accomplished by means of annual additions to the liability for future policy benefits and the deferral and subsequent amortization of policy acquisition costs.

Premiums from the Company's products with limited-pay features are collected over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided. Premiums for these products are recognized ratably over the scheduled premium payment period. At the policyholder's option, customers can also pay discounted advanced premiums for certain of these products. Advanced premiums are deferred and recognized ratably over the regularly scheduled premium payment period. For the Company's limited-pay products, any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred during the scheduled premium payment period and recognized into benefits in a constant relationship with insurance in force. Benefits are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. A liability for future policy benefits is recorded when premiums are recognized using the net premium method.

The calculation of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and the liability for future policy benefits requires the use of estimates based on sound actuarial valuation techniques. For new policy issues, we review our actuarial assumptions and deferrable acquisition costs each year and revise them when necessary to more closely reflect recent experience and studies of actual acquisition costs. For policies in force, we evaluate DAC by major product groupings to determine that they are recoverable from future revenues, and any amounts determined not to be recoverable are charged against net earnings. We have not had any material charges to earnings for DAC that was determined not to be recoverable in any of the years presented in this Form 10-K.

Advertising expense is reported as incurred in insurance expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, money market instruments and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased.

Investments:

Our debt securities consist of fixed-maturity securities, which are classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. Securities classified as held to maturity are securities that we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity or redemption and are carried at amortized cost. All other fixed-maturity debt securities, our perpetual securities and our equity securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value. If the fair value is higher than the amortized cost for debt and perpetual securities, or the purchase cost for equity securities, the excess is an unrealized gain, and if lower than cost, the difference is an unrealized loss. The net unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, plus the unamortized unrealized gains and losses on debt securities transferred to the held-to-maturity portfolio, less related deferred income taxes, are recorded through other comprehensive income and included in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Amortized cost of debt and perpetual securities is based on our purchase price adjusted for accrual of discount, or amortization of premium, and recognition of impairment charges, if any. The amortized cost of debt and perpetual securities we purchase at a discount or premium will equal the face or par value at maturity or the call date, if applicable. Interest is reported as income when earned and is adjusted for amortization of any premium or discount.

We have investments in variable interest entities (VIEs). Criteria for evaluating VIEs for consolidation focuses on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or (2) the right to receive benefits from the entity. We are the primary beneficiary of certain VIEs. While the VIEs generally operate within a defined set of


documents, there are certain powers that are retained by us that are considered significant in our conclusion that we are the primary beneficiary. These powers vary by structure but generally include the initial selection of the underlying collateral or, for collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), the reference credits to include in the structure; the ability to obtain the underlying collateral in the event of default; and the ability to appoint or dismiss key parties in the structure.  In particular, our powers surrounding the underlying collateral were the most significant powers since those most significantly impact the economics of the VIE. We have no obligation to provide any continuing financial support to any of the entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. Our maximum loss is limited to our original investment. Neither we nor any of our creditors have the ability to obtain the underlying collateral, nor do we have control over the instruments in the VIEs, unless there is an event of default. For those entities where we are the primary beneficiary, the assets consolidated are fixed-maturity securities, perpetual securities, equity securities, and derivative instruments; collateral is reported separately under the captions fixed maturities- and perpetual securities- consolidated variable interest entities on our balance sheet.

For the mortgage- and asset-backed securities held in our fixed maturities portfolio, we recognize income using a constant effective yield, which is based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments. The net investment in mortgage- and asset-backed securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied at the time of acquisition. This adjustment is reflected in net investment income.

We use the specific identification method to determine the gain or loss from securities transactions and report the realized gain or loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. Securities transactions are accounted for based on values as of the trade date of the transaction.

An investment in a fixed maturity, perpetual security or equity security is impaired if the fair value falls below book value. We regularly review our entire investment portfolio for declines in value. Our fixed maturities and investment-grade perpetual securities investments are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment using our debt impairment model. Our debt impairment model focuses on the ultimate collection of the cash flows from our investments. The determination of the amount of impairments under this model is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective securities. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.

The determination of whether an impairment in value of our debt securities is other than temporary is based largely on our evaluation of the issuer

'

s creditworthiness. We must apply considerable judgment in determining the likelihood of the security recovering in value while we own it. Factors that may influence this include the overall level of interest rates, credit spreads, the credit quality of the underlying issuer, and other factors. This process requires consideration of risks which can be controlled to a certain extent, such as credit risk, and risks which cannot be controlled, such as interest rate risk.

If, after monitoring and analyses, management believes that fair value will not recover to amortized cost prior to the disposal of the security, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment of the security. Once a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the impairment loss is separated into two separate components: the portion of the impairment related to credit and the portion of the impairment related to factors other than credit. We recognize a charge to earnings for the credit-related portion of other-than-temporary impairments. Impairments related to factors other than credit are charged to earnings in the event we intend to sell the security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost or if it is more likely than not that we would be required to dispose of the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost; otherwise, non-credit-related other-than-temporary impairments are charged to other comprehensive income.

Our investments in perpetual securities that are rated below investment grade and equity securities are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment under our equity impairment model. Our equity impairment model focuses on the severity of a security's decline in fair value coupled with the length of time the fair value of the security has been below amortized cost and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. For equity securities that have declines in value that are deemed to be temporary, we make an assertion as to our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery. Once identified, these equity securities are restricted from trading unless authorized based upon events that could not have been foreseen at the time we asserted our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery.

If management believes that the equity security will not recover prior to the disposal of the security, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment of the security. Once an equity security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, its fair value on that date becomes the new cost basis and the impairment loss is recognized in earnings.


We lend fixed-maturity securities to financial institutions in short-term security lending transactions. These securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our balance sheet during the terms of the loans and are not reported as sales. We receive cash or other securities as collateral for such loans. For loans involving unrestricted cash or securities as collateral, the collateral is reported as an asset with a corresponding liability for the return of the collateral.

Other investments include policy loans, middle market loans, and other short-term investments with maturities of one year or less, but greater than 90 days, at the time of purchase and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates estimated fair value. We invest in middle market loans through participation rights that are accounted for as loan receivables and recorded at amortized cost on the acquisition date. Since we have the intent and ability to hold these loan receivables for the foreseeable future or until they mature, they are considered held for investment and are carried at adjusted amortized cost in the other investments line on our consolidated balance sheets. The adjusted amortized cost of the loan receivables reflects allowances for expected incurred losses estimated based on past events and current economic conditions as of each reporting date.

Derivatives and Hedging:

Freestanding derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and are reported in other assets and other liabilities, with changes in value reported in earnings and/or other comprehensive income. These freestanding derivatives are interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, credit default swaps (CDSs), foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options, and options on interest rate swaps (or interest rate swaptions). Interest rate and foreign currency swaps are used within VIEs to hedge the risk arising from interest rate and currency exchange risk, while the CDSs are used to increase the yield and improve the diversification of the portfolio. Foreign currency forwards and options are used in hedging foreign exchange risk on U.S. dollar-denominated securities in Aflac Japan's portfolio. Foreign currency forwards and options are used to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the variability of interest cash flows associated with our variable interest rate notes. Cross-currency interest rate swaps, also referred to as foreign currency swaps, are used to economically convert certain U.S. dollar-denominated note obligations into yen-denominated principal and interest obligations. Interest rate swaptions have been used to hedge interest rate risk for certain U.S. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes, nor do we engage in leveraged derivative transactions.

From time to time, we purchase certain investments that contain an embedded derivative. We assess whether this embedded derivative is clearly and closely related to the asset that serves as its host contract. If we deem that the embedded derivative's terms are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the derivative is separated from that contract, held at fair value and reported with the host instrument in the consolidated balance sheet, with changes in fair value reported in earnings. If we have elected the fair value option, the embedded derivative is not bifurcated, and the entire investment is held at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings.

For those relationships where we seek hedge accounting, we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. We also assess, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. The assessment of hedge effectiveness determines the accounting treatment of noncash changes in fair value.

Changes in the fair value of any of our derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as long as they are deemed effective. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in current period earnings within derivative and other gains (losses). Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the consolidated statements of earnings in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded.

Changes in the estimated fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, including amounts measured as ineffectiveness, and changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item related to the designated risk being hedged, are reported in current earnings within derivative and other gains (losses).

We have designated the majority of the Parent Company's yen-denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes and yen-denominated loans) as non-derivative hedges and designated certain derivatives as hedges of the foreign currency exposure to our investment in Aflac Japan. At the beginning of each quarter, we make our net investment hedge designation. If the total of the designated Parent Company non-derivative and derivatives notional is equal to or less than our net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective, and the exchange effect on the yen-denominated


liabilities and the change in estimated fair value of the derivatives are reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. Should these designated net investment hedge positions exceed our net investment in Aflac Japan, the foreign exchange effect on the portion that exceeds our investment in Aflac Japan would be recognized in current earnings within derivative and other gains (losses).

Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are carried at fair value with all changes in fair value recorded in current period earnings within derivative and other gains (losses). We include the fair value of all freestanding derivatives in either other assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet.

We receive and pledge cash or other securities as collateral on open derivative positions. Cash received as collateral is reported as an asset with a corresponding liability for the return of the collateral. Cash pledged as collateral is recorded as a reduction to cash, and a corresponding receivable is recognized for the return of the cash collateral. We generally can repledge or resell collateral obtained by us, although we do not typically exercise such rights. Securities received as collateral are not recognized unless we were to exercise our right to sell that collateral or exercise remedies on that collateral upon a counterparty default. Securities that we have pledged as collateral continue to be carried as investment assets on our balance sheet.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs:

Certain direct and incremental costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized with interest over the premium payment periods in proportion to the ratio of annual premium income to total anticipated premium income. Anticipated premium income is estimated by using the same mortality, persistency and interest assumptions used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits. In this manner, the related acquisition expenses are matched with revenues. Deferred costs include the excess of current-year commissions over ultimate renewal-year commissions and certain incremental direct policy issue, underwriting and sales expenses. All of these incremental costs are directly related to successful policy acquisition.

For some products, policyholders can elect to modify product benefits, features, rights or coverages by exchanging a contract for a new contract or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. These transactions are known as internal replacements. For internal replacement transactions where the resulting contract is substantially unchanged, the policy is accounted for as a continuation of the replaced contract. Unamortized deferred acquisition costs from the original policy continue to be amortized over the expected life of the new policy, and the costs of replacing the policy are accounted for as policy maintenance costs and expensed as incurred. Internal replacement transactions that result in a policy that is not substantially unchanged are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original policy and the issuance of a new policy. Unamortized deferred acquisition costs on the original policy that was replaced are immediately expensed, and the costs of acquiring the new policy are capitalized and amortized in accordance with our accounting policies for deferred acquisition costs.

We measure the recoverability of DAC and the adequacy of our policy reserves annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business. Our testing indicates that our DAC is recoverable and our policy liabilities are adequate. (See the following discussion for further information regarding policy liabilities.)

Policy Liabilities:

Future policy benefits represent claims that are expected to occur in the future and are computed by a net level premium method using estimated future investment yields, persistency and recognized morbidity and mortality tables modified to reflect our experience, including a provision for adverse deviation. These assumptions are generally established at the time a policy is issued.

Unpaid policy claims are estimates computed on an undiscounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims experience adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. The ultimate liability may vary significantly from such estimates. We regularly adjust these estimates as new claims experience emerges and reflect the changes in operating results in the year such adjustments are made.

Other policy liabilities consist primarily of discounted advance premiums on deposit from policyholders in conjunction with their purchase of certain Aflac Japan limited-pay insurance products. These advanced premiums are deferred upon collection and recognized as premium revenue over the contractual premium payment period.

For internal replacements that are determined to not be substantially unchanged, policy liabilities related to the original policy that was replaced are immediately released, and policy liabilities are established for the new insurance contract.


Reinsurance:

We enter into reinsurance agreements with other companies in the normal course of business. For each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine if the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Reinsurance premiums and benefits paid or provided are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Premiums, benefits and DAC are reported net of insurance ceded. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Income Taxes:

Income tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing our income tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We record deferred tax assets for tax positions taken based on our assessment of whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized.

As discussed in the Translation of Foreign Currencies section above, Aflac Japan maintains certain dollar-denominated investments that, prior to October 1, 2013, did not have any foreign currency translation adjustments recognized in other comprehensive income. However, the deferred tax expense or benefit associated with foreign exchange gains or losses on these investments is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the securities mature or are sold. Total income tax expense (benefit) related to items of other comprehensive income (loss) included a deferred tax expense of

$614 million

in 2013 for these U.S. dollar-denominated investments. Excluding these amounts from total taxes on other comprehensive income would result in an effective income tax rate on pretax other comprehensive income (loss) of

31%

in 2013.

Policyholder Protection Corporation and State Guaranty Association Assessments:

In Japan, the government has required the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection corporation. We recognize a charge for our estimated share of the industry's obligation once it is determinable. We review the estimated liability for policyholder protection corporation contributions on an annual basis and report any adjustments in Aflac Japan's expenses.

In the United States, each state has a guaranty association that supports insolvent insurers operating in those states. To date, our state guaranty association assessments have not been material.

Treasury Stock:

Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of shareholders' equity at cost. We use the weighted-average purchase cost to determine the cost of treasury stock that is reissued. We include any gains and losses in additional paid-in capital when treasury stock is reissued.

Share-Based Compensation:

We measure compensation cost related to our share-based payment transactions at fair value on the grant date, and we recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award.

Earnings Per Share:

We compute basic earnings per share (EPS) by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of unrestricted shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period plus the shares representing the dilutive effect of share-based awards.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-year amounts to conform to current-year reporting classifications. These reclassifications had no impact on net earnings or total shareholders' equity.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items - Simplifying income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items:

In January 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained. The amendments in this updated guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or disclosures.


Receivables - Troubled debt restructurings by creditors - classification of certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure:

In August 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance for troubled debt restructurings affecting creditors that hold government guaranteed mortgage loans. The guidance requires that a mortgage loan be derecognized and a separate other receivable be recognized upon foreclosure if certain conditions are met.  We adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2015.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Transfers and Servicing, Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures:

In June 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance for repurchase agreement and security lending transactions to change the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions and linked repurchase financings to be accounted for as secured borrowings, consistent with the accounting for other repurchase agreements. The amendments also require new disclosures to increase transparency about the types of collateral pledged in repurchase agreements and similar transactions accounted for as secured borrowings. We adopted accounting changes for the new guidance as of January 1, 2015, and adopted the required disclosures as of April 1, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Receivables - Troubled debt restructurings by creditors - Reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon foreclosure:

In January 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance for troubled debt restructurings clarifying when an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and when a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan. We adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists:

In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance to amend the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The new guidance states that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. However, to the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets.  We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2014. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Derivatives and hedging:

In July 2013, the FASB issued an update which allows entities to use the Federal Funds Effective Swap Rate, also referred to as the Overnight Index Swap Rate (OIS), as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. This update reflects the evolution of market hedging practices and is intended to provide more flexibility for hedge accounting purposes. We adopted this guidance in the third quarter of 2013 on a prospective basis for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on or after the effective date of July 17, 2013. The adoption of the guidance had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income:

In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance that requires reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income to be presented in statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented or in the footnotes to the financial statements. Additionally, the amendment requires cross-referencing to other disclosures currently required for other reclassification items. We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance impacted our financial statement disclosures, but it did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities:

In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements about offsetting assets and liabilities. The new guidance clarifies the FASB's intent concerning the application of existing offsetting disclosure requirements. Entities are required to disclose gross and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions when those activities are subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. The scope of this guidance was clarified and revised in January 2013 to apply to derivatives, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements. We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance impacted our financial statement disclosures, but it did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.


Fees paid to the federal government by health insurers:

In July 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for fees owed by health insurers as mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which imposes an annual fee on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2014. A health insurer's portion of the annual fee is payable by September 30 of the applicable calendar year once the entity provides health insurance for any U.S. health risk in that year. The accounting guidance specifies that the liability for the fee should be estimated and recorded in full in the applicable calendar year in which the fee is payable. We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2014. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption

Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities:

In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The main provisions require that equity investments be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income; that changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities that are measured under the fair value option be recognized in other comprehensive income; and that entities would make the assessment of the ability to realize a deferred tax asset (DTA) related to an available-for-sale (AFS) debt security in combination with the entity's other DTAs. The amendments are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is not permitted, with the exception of the own credit provision if an entity has elected to measure a liability at fair value. We are evaluating whether the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or disclosures.

Business Combinations - Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments:

In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring that an acquirer recognize adjustments to estimated amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined. In the same period’s financial statements, the acquirer is required to record income effects of the adjustments as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The acquirer is also required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the estimated amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendment is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Fair Value Measurement - Disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent):

In May 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented whereby an investment for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient be removed from the fair value hierarchy in all periods presented in an entity’s financial statements. Earlier application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or disclosures.

Financial Services - Insurance - Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts:

In May 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance requiring enhanced disclosures by all insurance entities that issue short-duration contracts. The amendments require insurance entities to disclose for annual reporting periods information about the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. The amendments also require insurance entities to disclose information about significant changes in methodologies and assumptions used to calculate the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. In addition, the amendments require insurance entities to disclose for annual and interim reporting periods a roll-forward of the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. For health insurance claims, the amendments require the disclosure of the total of incurred-but-not-reported liabilities and expected development on reported claims included in the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. The amendments are effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application of the amendments is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.


Interest - Imputation of Interest - Simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs:

In April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs. The updated guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this amendment. In August 2015, the FASB issued updated SEC Staff guidance pertaining to the presentation of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. The guidance states that an entity may defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset, subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The amendment is effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Consolidation - Amendments to the consolidation analysis:

In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that affects evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities (limited liability corporations and securitization structures, etc.) are VIEs, evaluation of whether fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider are a variable interest, and evaluation of the effect of fee arrangements and the effect of related parties on the determination of the primary beneficiary under the VIE model for consolidation. The updated guidance eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. Limited partnership and similar legal entities that provide partners with either substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights over the general partner will now be evaluated under the voting interest model rather than the VIE model for consolidation. In situations where no single party has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, the related party relationships under common control should be considered in their entirety in determining whether that common control group has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. The amendments in the updated guidance are effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of this guidance will result in a reduction to the number of our investments that meet the definition of a VIE and will also reduce the number of VIEs required to be disclosed within our financial statements. The adoption of this guidance will impact our footnote disclosures, but will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Derivatives and Hedging - Determining whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or equity:

In November 2014, the FASB issued guidance to clarify how to evaluate the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. The guidance also clarifies that an entity should assess the substance of the relevant terms and features when considering how to weight those terms and features. The guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern - Disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern:

In August 2014, the FASB issued this amendment that provides U.S. GAAP guidance on management’s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued.  The amendment is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Compensation - Stock Compensation - Accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period:

In June 2014, the FASB issued this amendment that provides guidance on certain share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.


Revenue from contracts with customers:

In May 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance that affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for this standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Recent accounting guidance not discussed above is not applicable, did not have, or is not expected to have a material impact to our business.

BUSINESS SEGMENT AND FOREIGN INFORMATION

The Company consists of

two

reportable insurance business segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S., both of which sell supplemental health and life insurance. Operating business segments that are not individually reportable and business activities, including reinsurance retrocession activities, not included in Aflac Japan or Aflac U.S. are included in the "Other business segments" category.

We do not allocate corporate overhead expenses to business segments. We evaluate and manage our business segments using a financial performance measure called pretax operating earnings. Our definition of operating earnings includes interest cash flows associated with notes payable and excludes the following items from net earnings on an after-tax basis: realized investment gains/losses (securities transactions, impairments, and the impact of derivative and hedging activities), nonrecurring items and other non-operating income (loss). We then exclude income taxes related to operations to arrive at pretax operating earnings. Information regarding operations by segment for the years ended

December 31

Excluding a gain of

$85

in 2015,

$44

in 2014 and

3. INVESTMENTS

Net Investment Income

The components of net investment income for the years ended December 31 were as follows:


Investment Holdings

The amortized cost for our investments in debt and perpetual securities, the cost for equity securities and the fair values of these investments at

December 31

are shown in the following tables.




The methods of determining the fair values of our investments in fixed-maturity securities, perpetual securities and equity securities are described in Note 5.

During the third and fourth quarters of 2015, we increased our investment in yen-denominated publicly traded equity securities, including new investments in exchange traded funds (ETFs) holding Japan real estate investment trusts. These securities are classified as available for sale and carried on our balance sheet at fair value. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our investment in yen-denominated publicly traded equity securities was

$485 million

.

During 2015, we did not reclassify any investments from the held-to-maturity category to the available-for-sale category. During 2014, we reclassified

three

investments from the held-to-maturity category to the available-for-sale category as a result of the issuers being downgraded to below investment grade. At the time of the transfer, the securities had an aggregate amortized cost of

$424 million

and an aggregate unrealized loss of

$54 million

. During 2013, we reclassified

two

investments from the held-to-maturity category to the available-for-sale category as a result of the issuer being downgraded to below investment grade. At the time of the transfer, the securities had an aggregate amortized cost of

$492 million

and an aggregate unrealized loss of

$153 million

.

Contractual and Economic Maturities

The contractual maturities of our investments in fixed maturities at

December 31, 2015

, were as follows:


At

December 31, 2015

, the Parent Company and other business segments had portfolios of available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities totaling

$512 million

at amortized cost and

$523 million

at fair value, which are not included in the table above.

Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The majority of our perpetual securities are subordinated to other debt obligations of the issuer, but rank higher than the issuer's equity securities. Perpetual securities have characteristics of both debt and equity investments, along with unique features that create economic maturity dates for the securities. Although perpetual securities have no contractual maturity date, they have stated interest coupons that were fixed at their issuance and subsequently change to a floating short-term interest rate after some period of time. The instruments are generally callable by the issuer at the time of changing from a fixed coupon rate to a new variable rate of interest, which is determined by the combination of some market index plus a fixed amount of basis points. The net effect is to create an expected maturity date for the instrument. The economic maturities of our investments in perpetual securities, which were all reported as available for sale at

December 31, 2015

, were as follows:

Investment Concentrations

Our process for credit-related investments begins with an independent approach to underwriting each issuer's fundamental credit quality.  We evaluate independently those factors which we believe could influence an issuer's ability to make payments under the contractual terms of our instruments. This includes a thorough analysis of a variety of items including the issuer's country of domicile (including political, legal, and financial considerations); the industry in which the issuer competes (with an analysis of industry structure, end-market dynamics, and regulation); company specific issues (such as management, assets, earnings, cash generation, and capital needs); and contractual provisions of the instrument (such as financial covenants and position in the capital structure). We further evaluate the investment considering broad business and portfolio management objectives, including asset/liability needs, portfolio diversification, and expected income.

Investment exposures that individually exceeded 10% of shareholders' equity as of

December 31

were as follows:

(1)

JGBs or JGB-backed securities

Banks and Financial Institutions

One of our largest investment sector concentrations as of

December 31, 2015

, was banks and financial institutions. Within the countries we approve for investment opportunities, we primarily invest in financial institutions that are strategically crucial to each approved country's economy.  The bank and financial institution sector is a highly regulated industry and plays a strategic role in the global economy.

Our total investments in the bank and financial institution sector as of

December 31

, including those classified as perpetual securities, were as follows:


Realized Investment Gains and Losses

Information regarding pretax realized gains and losses from investments for the years ended

December 31

follows:


Other-than-temporary Impairment

The majority of our fixed maturity and perpetual security investments are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment using our debt impairment model. Our debt impairment model focuses on the ultimate collection of the cash flows from our investments and whether we have the intent to sell or if it is more likely than not we would be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. The fair values of our fixed maturity and perpetual security investments fluctuate based on changes in interest rates, foreign exchange, and credit spreads in the global financial markets. Fair values can also be heavily influenced by the values of the assets of the issuer and expected ultimate recovery values upon a default, bankruptcy or other financial restructuring. Credit spreads are most impacted by the general credit environment and global market liquidity. Interest rates are driven by numerous factors including, but not limited to, supply and demand, governmental monetary actions, expectations of inflation and economic growth. We believe that fluctuations in the fair values of our investment securities related to general changes in the level of credit spreads or interest rates have little bearing on underlying credit quality of the issuer, and whether our investment is ultimately recoverable. Generally, we consider such declines in fair values to be temporary even in situations where an investment remains in an unrealized loss position for an extended period of time.

In the course of our review process, we may determine that it is unlikely that our fixed maturity or perpetual security investment will recover in value within an acceptable time frame. Factors which may influence this determination include the severity of the price decline, the length of time the price has been impaired, if the price decline was driven by issuer credit deterioration, and our view of the likelihood of the security defaulting or otherwise being subject to an unfavorable restructuring. In those cases where we believe the security will not recover in price within an acceptable period of time, we consider such a decline in the investment's fair value, to the extent it is below the investment's cost or amortized cost, to be an other-than-temporary impairment of the investment and reduce the book value of the investment to its fair value.

The perpetual securities we hold were largely issued by banks that are integral to the financial markets of the sovereign country of the issuer. As a result of the issuer's position within the economy of the sovereign country, our perpetual securities may be subject to a higher risk of nationalization of their issuers in connection with capital injections from an issuer's sovereign government. We cannot be assured that such capital support will extend to all levels of an issuer's capital structure.  In addition, certain governments or regulators may consider imposing interest and principal payment restrictions on issuers of hybrid securities to preserve cash and preserve the issuer's capital. Beyond the cash flow impact that additional deferrals would have on our portfolio, such deferrals could result in ratings downgrades of the affected securities, which in turn could result in a reduction of fair value of the securities and increase our regulatory capital requirements. We consider these factors in our credit review process.

When determining our intention to sell a security prior to recovery of its fair value to amortized cost, we evaluate facts and circumstances such as, but not limited to, future cash flow needs, decisions to reposition our security portfolio, and risk profile of individual investment holdings. We perform ongoing analyses of our liquidity needs, which includes cash flow testing of our policy liabilities, debt maturities, projected dividend payments and other cash flow and liquidity needs. Our cash flow testing includes extensive duration analysis of our investment portfolio and policy liabilities. Based on our analyses, we have concluded that we have sufficient excess cash flows to meet our liquidity needs without selling any of our investments prior to their maturity.

Our investments in perpetual securities that are rated below investment grade and equity securities are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment under our equity impairment model. Our equity impairment model focuses on the severity of a security’s decline in fair value coupled with the length of time the fair value of the security has been below cost or amortized cost and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. For equity securities, we also verify our intent to hold the securities until they recover in value. The fair value of our investments in equity securities may decline for various reasons, such as general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole, or due to specific information pertaining to an industry or an individual company. For those equity securities evaluated for impairment under the equity impairment model that are in an unrealized loss position, if we believe the security will not recover in price within an acceptable period of time, or we do not have the intent to hold until recovery, we will record an other-than-temporary impairment of the investment and reduce the cost of the investment to its fair value on that date.

The following table details our pretax other-than-temporary impairment losses by investment category that resulted from our impairment evaluation process for the years ended

December 31

Gross Unrealized Loss Aging

The following tables show the fair values and gross unrealized losses of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments that were in an unrealized loss position, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at

December 31

.



Analysis of Securities in Unrealized Loss Positions

The unrealized losses on our fixed income or perpetual securities investments have been primarily related to general market changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and/or the levels of credit spreads rather than specific concerns with the issuer's ability to pay interest and repay principal. The unrealized losses on our investments in equity securities are primarily related to general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or due to specific information pertaining to an industry or an individual company.

For any significant declines in fair value of our fixed income or perpetual securities, we perform a more focused review of the related issuers' credit profile. For corporate issuers, we evaluate their assets, business profile including industry dynamics and competitive positioning, financial statements and other available financial data. For non-corporate issuers, we analyze all sources of credit support, including issuer-specific factors. We utilize information available in the public domain and, for certain private placement issuers, from consultations with the issuers directly. We also consider ratings from Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs), as well as the specific characteristics of the security we own including seniority in the issuer's capital structure, covenant predictions, or other relevant features. From these reviews, we evaluate the issuers' continued ability to service our investment through payment of interest and principal.

For any significant declines in fair value of our equity securities, we review the severity of the security’s decline in fair value coupled with the length of time the fair value of the security has been below cost. We also perform a more focused review of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and determine whether we have the intent to hold the securities until they recover in value.


The following table provides more information on our unrealized loss position on fixed maturities and perpetual securities as of December 31.

Assuming no credit-related factors, unrealized gains and losses are expected to diminish as investments near maturity. Based on our credit analysis, we believe that the issuers of our investments in the sectors shown in the table above have the ability to service their obligations to us.

Perpetual Securities

The majority of our investments in Upper Tier II and Tier I perpetual securities are in highly-rated global financial institutions. Upper Tier II securities have more debt-like characteristics than Tier I securities and are senior to Tier I securities, preferred stock, and common equity of the issuer. Conversely, Tier I securities have more equity-like characteristics, but are senior to the common equity of the issuer, and they may also be senior to certain preferred shares; depending on the individual security; the issuer's capital structure and the regulatory jurisdiction of the issuer.

Details of our holdings of perpetual securities as of December 31 were as follows:

Perpetual Securities

Assuming no credit-related factors develop, as investments near maturity, the unrealized gains or losses are expected to diminish. Based on our credit analysis, we believe that the issuers of our investments in these sectors have the ability to service their obligations to us. Perpetual securities that had an amortized cost of

$599 million

and fair value of

$630 million

at December 31, 2014 matured or were called during 2015.


Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)

As a condition to our involvement or investment in a VIE, we enter into certain protective rights and covenants that preclude changes in the structure of the VIE that would alter the creditworthiness of our investment or our beneficial interest in the VIE.

Our involvement with all of the VIEs in which we have an interest is passive in nature, and we are not the arranger of these entities.  We have not been involved in establishing these entities, except as it relates to our review and evaluation of the structure of these VIEs in the normal course of our investment decision-making process. Further, we are not, nor have we been, required to purchase any securities issued in the future by these VIEs.

Our ownership interest in the VIEs is limited to holding the obligations issued by them.  All of the VIEs in which we invest are static with respect to funding and have no ongoing forms of funding after the initial funding date. We have no direct or contingent obligations to fund the limited activities of these VIEs, nor do we have any direct or indirect financial guarantees related to the limited activities of these VIEs.  We have not provided any assistance or any other type of financing support to any of the VIEs we invest in, nor do we have any intention to do so in the future.  The weighted-average lives of our notes are very similar to the underlying collateral held by these VIEs where applicable.

Our risk of loss related to our interests in any of our VIEs is limited to our investment in the debt securities issued by them.

VIEs - Consolidated

The following table presents the cost or amortized cost, fair value and balance sheet caption in which the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs are reported as of December 31.

Investments in Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

We are substantively the only investor in the consolidated VIEs listed in the table above. As the sole investor in these VIEs, we have the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and are therefore considered to be the primary beneficiary of the VIEs that we consolidate. We also participate in substantially all of the variability created by these VIEs. The activities of these VIEs are limited to holding debt, equity, and perpetual securities and foreign currency, and/or CDSs, as appropriate, and utilizing the cash flows from these securities to service our investment. Neither we nor any of our creditors are able to obtain the underlying collateral of the VIEs unless there is an event of default or other specified event. For those VIEs that contain a swap, we are not a direct counterparty to the swap contracts and have no control over them. Our loss exposure to these VIEs is limited to our original investment. Our consolidated VIEs do not rely on outside or ongoing sources of funding to support their activities beyond the underlying collateral and swap contracts, if applicable. With the exception of our investment in senior secured bank loans (bank loans) and certain equity securities through unit trust structures, the underlying collateral assets and funding of our consolidated VIEs are generally static in nature and the underlying collateral and the reference corporate entities covered by any CDS contracts were all investment grade at the time of issuance.


We invest in bank loans through unit trust structures in which we are the only investor, requiring us to consolidate these trusts. These bank loans are classified as available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2015, the amortized cost and fair value of our bank loan investments was

$1.4 billion

. As of December 31, 2014, the amortized cost and fair value of our bank loan investments was

$501 million

and

$579 million

, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we invested in yen-denominated public equities through a unit trust structure in which we are the only investor, requiring us to consolidate the trust under U.S. GAAP. These equities are classified as available-for-sale in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2015, the amortized cost and fair value of these equities was

$363 million

.

We are exposed to credit losses within our CDO that could result in principal losses to our investment. However, we have mitigated the risk of credit loss through the structure of the VIE, which contractually requires the subordinated tranches within the VIE to absorb the majority of the expected losses from the underlying credit default swaps. We currently own only senior mezzanine CDO tranches. Based on our statistical analysis models and the current subordination levels in our CDO, the VIE can sustain a reasonable number of defaults in the underlying reference entities in the CDS with no loss to our investment.

VIEs - Not Consolidated

The table below reflects the amortized cost, fair value and balance sheet caption in which our investment in VIEs not consolidated are reported as of December 31.

Investments in Variable Interest Entities Not Consolidated

The VIEs that we are not required to consolidate are investments that are in the form of debt obligations from the VIEs that are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by their corporate parents or sponsors. These VIEs are the primary financing vehicles used by their corporate sponsors to raise financing in the capital markets. The variable interests created by these VIEs are principally or solely a result of the debt instruments issued by them. We do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, nor do we have (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or (2) the right to receive benefits from the entity. As such, we are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and are therefore not required to consolidate them. These VIE investments comprise securities from


separate issuers with an average credit rating of

BBB

.

Loans and Loan Receivables

Middle Market Loans

As of

December 31, 2015

, our investment in middle market loan receivables was

$118 million

, of which

$53 million

was unfunded, while the associated allowance for expected losses was immaterial. As of

December 31, 2015

, we had commitments of

$182 million

to fund potential future loan originations related to this investment program. These commitments are contingent upon the availability of middle market loans that meet our underwriting criteria.

Commercial Mortgage Loans

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated our commercial mortgage loan investment program. As of

December 31, 2015

, we had not yet funded any commercial mortgage loans. Once funded, we intend to classify our commercial mortgage loans as held-for-investment, and we will carry them on the balance sheet at amortized cost less an estimated allowance for loan losses. Our commercial mortgage loan allowance for losses will be established using both specific and general allowances. The specific allowance will be used on an individual loan basis for those impaired loans where we expect to incur a loss. The general allowance will be used for loans grouped by similar risk characteristics where a property-specific


or market-specific risk has not been identified, but for which we expect to incur a loss. As of

December 31, 2015

, we had

$10 million

in outstanding commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans. These commitments are contingent on the final underwriting and due diligence to be performed, and may or may not be funded.

Securities Lending and Pledged Securities

We lend fixed-maturity securities to financial institutions in short-term security-lending transactions. These short-term security-lending arrangements increase investment income with minimal risk. Our security lending policy requires that the fair value of the securities and/or unrestricted cash received as collateral be

102%

or more of the fair value of the loaned securities. These securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our balance sheet during the terms of the loans and are not reported as sales. We receive cash or other securities as collateral for such loans. For loans involving unrestricted cash or securities as collateral, the collateral is reported as an asset with a corresponding liability for the return of the collateral.

Details of our securities lending activities as of December 31 were as follows:

(1)

These securities are pledged as collateral under our U.S. securities lending program and can be called at our discretion; therefore, they are classified as Overnight and Continuous.

(1)

These securities are pledged as collateral under our U.S. securities lending program and can be called at our discretion; therefore, they are classified as Overnight and Continuous.

We did not have any repurchase agreements or repurchase-to-maturity transactions outstanding as of

December 31, 2015

and 2014, respectively.


Certain fixed-maturity securities have been pledged as collateral as part of derivative transactions. For additional information regarding pledged securities related to derivative transactions, see Note 4.

At

December 31, 2015

, debt securities with a fair value of

$15 million

were on deposit with regulatory authorities in

the United States (including U.S. territories) and Japan. We retain ownership of all securities on deposit and receive the related investment income.

For general information regarding our investment accounting policies, see Note 1.

4.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Our freestanding derivative financial instruments consist of: (1) foreign currency swaps and credit default swaps that are associated with investments in special-purpose entities, including VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary; (2) foreign currency forwards and options used in hedging foreign exchange risk on U.S. dollar-denominated securities in Aflac Japan's portfolio; (3) foreign currency forwards and options used to hedge foreign exchange risk from our net investment in Aflac Japan and economically hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen; (4) swaps associated with our notes payable, consisting of cross-currency interest rate swaps, also referred to as foreign currency swaps, associated with certain senior notes and our subordinated debentures; and (5) options on interest rate swaps (or interest rate swaptions) and futures used to hedge interest rate risk for certain available-for-sale securities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, nor do we engage in leveraged derivative transactions. Some of our derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges; however, other derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting or we elect not to designate them as an accounting hedge. We utilize a net investment hedge to mitigate foreign exchange exposure resulting from our net investment in Aflac Japan. In addition to designating derivatives as hedging instruments, we have designated our yen-denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes and yen-denominated loans as non-derivative hedging instruments for this net investment hedge.

Derivative Types

We enter into foreign currency swaps pursuant to which we exchange an initial principal amount in

one

currency for an initial principal amount of another currency, with an agreement to re-exchange the currencies at a future date at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be periodic exchanges of payments at specified intervals based on the agreed upon rates and notional amounts. Foreign currency swaps are used primarily in the consolidated VIEs in our Aflac Japan portfolio to convert foreign-denominated cash flows to yen, the functional currency of Aflac Japan, in order to minimize cash flow fluctuations. We also use foreign currency swaps to economically convert certain of our dollar-denominated senior note and subordinated debenture principal and interest obligations into yen-denominated obligations.

Foreign currency forwards and options with short-term maturities are executed for the Aflac Japan segment in order to hedge the currency risk on the fair value of certain fixed-maturity U.S. dollar-denominated securities. In forward transactions, Aflac Japan agrees with another party to buy a fixed amount of yen and sell a corresponding amount of U.S. dollars at a specified future date. Aflac Japan also executes foreign currency option transactions in a collar strategy, where Aflac Japan agrees with another party to simultaneously purchase a fixed amount of U.S. dollar put options and sell U.S. dollar call options. The combination of these two actions results in no net premium being paid (i.e. a costless or zero-cost collar). The foreign currency forwards and options are used in fair value hedging relationships to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with U.S. dollar-denominated investments supporting yen-denominated liabilities.

Foreign currency forwards and options are also used to hedge the currency risk associated with the net investment in Aflac Japan. In these forward transactions, Aflac agrees with another party to buy a fixed amount of U.S. dollars and sell a corresponding amount of yen at a specified future date. In the option transactions, we use a combination of foreign currency options to protect expected future cash flows by simultaneously purchasing yen put options (options that protect against a weakening yen) and selling yen call options (options that limit participation in a strengthening yen). The combination of these two actions results in no net premium being paid (i.e. a costless or zero-cost collar).

The only CDS that we currently hold relates to components of an investment in a VIE and is used to assume credit risk related to an individual security. This CDS contract entitles the consolidated VIE to receive periodic fees in exchange for an obligation to compensate the derivative counterparties should the referenced security issuer experience a credit event, as defined in the contract.

Interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of cash flows with other parties, at specified intervals, calculated using agreed upon rates or other financial variables and notional principal amounts. Typically, at the time a swap is


entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value. No cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts on floating-rate fixed-maturity securities contracts to fixed rates. These derivatives are predominantly used to better match cash receipts from assets with cash disbursements required to fund liabilities.

Interest rate swaptions are options on interest rate swaps. Interest rate collars are combinations of two swaption positions and are executed in order to hedge certain U.S. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities that are held in the Aflac Japan segment. We use collars to protect against significant changes in the fair value associated with interest rate changes of our U.S. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities. In order to maximize the efficiency of the collars while minimizing cost, we set the strike price on each collar so that the premium paid for the ‘payer leg’ is offset by the premium received for having sold the ‘receiver leg’.

Periodically, depending on general economic conditions, we may enter into other derivative transactions.

Credit Risk Assumed through Derivatives

For the foreign currency and credit default swaps associated with our VIE investments for which we are the primary beneficiary, we bear the risk of foreign exchange loss due to counterparty default even though we are not a direct counterparty to those contracts. We are a direct counterparty to the foreign currency swaps that we have entered into in connection with certain of our senior notes, subordinated debentures, and Samurai notes; foreign currency forwards; foreign currency options; and interest rate swaptions, and therefore we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties in those contracts. The risk of counterparty default for our VIE swaps, foreign currency swaps, certain foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options and interest rate swaptions is mitigated by collateral posting requirements that counterparties to those transactions must meet. As of

December 31, 2015

, there were


counterparties to our derivative agreements, with

five

comprising

63%

of the aggregate notional amount. The counterparties to these derivatives are financial institutions with the following credit ratings as of December 31:

We engage in derivative transactions directly with unaffiliated third parties under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements and other documentation. Most of the ISDA agreements also include Credit Support Annex (CSA) provisions, which generally provide for two-way collateral postings, in certain cases at the first dollar of exposure and in other cases once various rating and exposure threshold levels are triggered. We mitigate the risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value while generally requiring that collateral be posted at the outset of the transaction or that additional collateral be posted upon the occurrence of certain events or circumstances. In addition, a significant portion of the derivative transactions have provisions that require collateral to be posted upon a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings or give the counterparty the right to terminate the transaction upon a downgrade of Aflac’s financial strength rating. The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions, and other factors prevailing at and after the time of the downgrade.

The fair value of the collateral posted by us to third parties for derivative transactions was

$20 million

at

December 31, 2015

, which consisted of

$17 million

of pledged securities and

$3 million

of cash, compared with

$1.6 billion

at

December 31, 2014

, which consisted  entirely of pledged securities. This collateral can generally be repledged or resold by the counterparties. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position by counterparty was approximately

$26 million

and

$2.1 billion

as of

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on

December 31, 2015

, we estimate that we would be required to post a maximum of

$6 million

of additional collateral to these derivative counterparties. Collateral obtained by us from third parties for derivative transactions was

$412 million


and

$619 million

at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively. We are generally allowed to sell or repledge collateral obtained from our derivative counterparties, although we do not typically exercise such rights.

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments

Freestanding derivatives are carried at estimated fair value in our consolidated balance sheets either as other assets or as other liabilities. See Note 5 for a discussion on how we determine the fair value of our derivatives. Accruals on derivatives are recorded in accrued investment income or within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge or its use in managing risk does not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative are generally reported within derivative and other gains(losses), which is a component of realized investment gains (losses). The fluctuations in estimated fair value of derivatives that have not been designated for hedge accounting can result in volatility in net earnings.

Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated risk of the hedged item. At the inception of the hedging relationship for hedges we elect to designate for hedge accounting treatment, we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. We document the designation of each hedge as either (i) a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability or the hedge of a forecasted transaction ("cash flow hedge"); (ii) a hedge of the estimated fair value of a recognized asset or liability ("fair value hedge"); or (iii) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. The documentation process includes linking derivatives and nonderivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets or groups of assets or liabilities on the statement of financial position or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness and ineffectiveness testing methods to be used. At the hedge's inception and on an ongoing quarterly basis, we also formally assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective in offsetting their designated risk. Hedge effectiveness is assessed using qualitative and quantitative methods.

For assessing hedge effectiveness of cash flow hedges, qualitative methods may include the comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item, and quantitative methods may include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. Hedge ineffectiveness of the hedge relationships on our VIE cash flow hedges is measured each reporting period using the “Hypothetical Derivative Method.” For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings within derivative and other gains (losses). All components of each derivative's gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

For assessing hedge effectiveness of fair value hedges, qualitative methods may include the comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item, and quantitative methods may include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value associated with the hedge relationship. Hedge ineffectiveness of the hedge relationships is measured each reporting period using the dollar offset method. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative, including amounts measured as ineffectiveness, and changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item related to the designated risk being hedged, are reported in current earnings within derivative and other gains (losses). When assessing the effectiveness of our fair value hedges, we exclude the changes in fair value related to the difference between the spot and the forward rate on our foreign currency forwards and the time value of options.

For the hedge of our net investment in Aflac Japan, we have designated Parent Company yen-denominated liabilities as non-derivative hedging instruments and have designated certain foreign currency forwards and options as derivative hedging instruments. We make our net investment hedge designation at the beginning of each quarter. For assessing hedge effectiveness of net investment hedges, if the total of the designated Parent Company non-derivative and derivatives notional is equal to or less than our net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective. If the hedge is effective, the related exchange effect on the yen-denominated liabilities is reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, Aflac follows the forward-rate method. According to that method, all changes in fair value, including changes related to the forward-rate component of foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign currency options, are reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. Should these designated net investment hedge


positions exceed our net investment in Aflac Japan, the foreign exchange effect on the portion that exceeds our investment in Aflac Japan would be recognized in current earnings within derivative and other gains (losses).

Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting

We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated cash flows or fair value of a hedged item; (2) the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.

When hedge accounting is discontinued on a cash flow hedge or fair value hedge, the derivative is carried in the consolidated balance sheets at its estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in current period earnings. For discontinued cash flow hedges, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the cash flow of the hedged item.

Derivative Balance Sheet Classification

The tables below summarize the balance sheet classification of our derivative fair value amounts, as well as the gross asset and liability fair value amounts, at December 31. The fair value amounts presented do not include income accruals. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated. Notional amounts are not reflective of credit risk.


Cash Flow Hedges

Certain of our consolidated VIEs have foreign currency swaps that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. For those that have qualified, we have designated the derivative as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset (“cash flow” hedge). We expect to continue this hedging activity for a weighted-average period of approximately


years. The remaining derivatives in our consolidated VIEs that have not qualified for hedge accounting have been designated as held for other investment purposes (“non-qualifying strategies”).

Fair Value Hedges

We designate and account for certain foreign currency forwards and options as fair value hedges when they meet the requirements for hedge accounting. These foreign currency forwards and options hedge the foreign currency exposure of certain U.S. dollar-denominated fixed maturity securities within the investment portfolio of our Aflac Japan segment. We recognize gains and losses on these derivatives and the related hedged items in current earnings within derivative and other gains (losses). The change in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards related to the changes in the difference between the spot rate and the forward price is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The change in fair value of the foreign currency option related to the time value of the option is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

We designate and account for interest rate swaptions as fair value hedges when they meet the requirements for hedge accounting. These interest rate swaptions hedge the interest rate exposure of certain U.S. dollar-denominated fixed maturity securities within the investment portfolio of our Aflac Japan segment. We recognize gains and losses on these derivatives and the related hedged items in current earnings within derivative and other gains (losses). The change


in the fair value of the interest rate swaptions related to the time value of the option is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

The following table presents the gains and losses on derivatives and the related hedged items in fair value hedges for the years ended December 31.

Fair Value Hedging Relationships

Net Investment Hedge

Our primary exposure to be hedged is our net investment in Aflac Japan, which is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. To mitigate this exposure, we have designated the Parent Company's yen-denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes - see Note 9) as non-derivative hedges and designated foreign currency forwards and options as derivative hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in Aflac Japan.

We used foreign exchange forwards and options to hedge foreign exchange risk on

30.0 billion

yen,

102.5 billion

yen,

25.0 billion

yen, and

85.0 billion

yen of profit repatriation received from Aflac Japan in February 2015, July 2015, September 2015, and December 2015, respectively. As of

December 31, 2015

, we had entered into foreign exchange forwards and options as part of a hedge on

124.1 billion

yen of future profit repatriation.

Non-qualifying Strategies

For our derivative instruments in consolidated VIEs that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all changes in their fair value are reported in current period earnings within derivative and other gains (losses). The amount of gain or loss recognized in earnings for our VIEs is attributable to the derivatives in those investment structures. While the change in value of the swaps is recorded through current period earnings, the change in value of the available-for-sale fixed maturity or perpetual securities associated with these swaps is recorded through other comprehensive income.

We have cross-currency interest rate swap agreements related to our

$400 million

senior notes due February 2017,

$550 million

senior notes due March 2020,

$350 million

senior notes due February 2022,

$700 million

senior notes due June


2023,

$750 million

senior notes due November 2024,

$450 million

senior notes due March 2025, and

$500 million

subordinated debentures due September 2052. Changes in the values of these swaps are recorded through current period earnings. For additional information regarding these swaps, see Note 9.

Impact of Derivatives and Hedging Instruments

The following table summarizes the impact to realized investment gains (losses) and other comprehensive income (loss) from all derivatives and hedging instruments for the years ended December 31.

and


. As of

December 31, 2015

, deferred gains and losses on derivative instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months were immaterial.

Offsetting of Financial Instruments and Derivatives

Some of the Company's derivative instruments are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that provide for the net settlement of all derivative contracts between the Parent Company or Aflac and its respective counterparty in the event of default or upon the occurrence of certain termination events. Collateral support agreements with certain of the master netting arrangements provide that the Company will receive or pledge financial collateral in the event either minimum thresholds, or in certain cases ratings levels, have been reached.

We have securities lending agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions that post collateral to us in return for the use of our fixed maturity securities (see Note 3). When we have entered into securities lending agreements with the same counterparty, the agreements generally provide for net settlement in the event of default by the counterparty. This right of


set-off would allow us to keep and apply collateral received if the counterparty failed to return the securities borrowed from us as contractually agreed. For additional information on the Company's accounting policy for securities lending, see

Note 1.

The tables below summarize our derivatives and securities lending transactions as of December 31, and as reflected in the tables, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, our policy is to not offset these financial instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair Value Hierarchy

U.S. GAAP specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. These two types of inputs create three valuation hierarchy levels. Level 1 valuations reflect quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 valuations reflect quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets or model-derived valuations in which all significant valuation inputs are observable in active markets. Level 3 valuations reflect valuations in which one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in an active market.

The following tables present the fair value hierarchy levels of the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31.




The following tables present the carrying amount and fair value categorized by fair value hierarchy level for the Company's financial instruments that are not carried at fair value as of December 31.


Fair Value of Financial Instruments

U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments including those that are not carried at fair value. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, other investments, receivables, accrued investment income, accounts payable, cash collateral and payables for security transactions approximated their fair values due to the nature of these instruments. Liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims are not financial instruments as defined by U.S. GAAP.

Fixed maturities, perpetual securities, and equity securities

We determine the fair values of our fixed maturity securities, perpetual securities, and public and privately issued equity securities using the following approaches or techniques: price quotes and valuations from third party pricing vendors (including quoted market prices readily available from public exchange markets) and non-binding price quotes we obtain from outside brokers.

A third party pricing vendor has developed valuation models to determine fair values of privately issued securities to reflect the impact of the persistent economic environment and the changing regulatory framework. These models are discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation models, but also use information from related markets, specifically the CDS market to estimate expected cash flows. These models take into consideration any unique characteristics of the securities and make various adjustments to arrive at an appropriate issuer-specific loss adjusted credit curve.

This credit curve is then used with the relevant recovery rates to estimate expected cash flows and modeling of additional features, including illiquidity adjustments, if necessary, to price the security by discounting those loss adjusted cash flows. In cases where a credit curve cannot be developed from the specific security features, the valuation methodology takes into consideration other market observable inputs, including: 1) the most appropriate comparable security(ies) of the issuer; 2) issuer-specific CDS spreads; 3) bonds or CDS spreads of comparable issuers with similar characteristics such as rating, geography, or sector; or 4) bond indices that are comparative in rating, industry, maturity and region.

The pricing data and market quotes we obtain from outside sources, including third party pricing services, are reviewed internally for reasonableness. If a fair value appears unreasonable, we will re-examine the inputs and assess the reasonableness of the pricing data with the vendor. Additionally, we may compare the inputs to relevant market indices


and other performance measurements. The output of this analysis is presented to the Company's Valuation and Classifications Subcommittee, or VCS. Based on the analysis provided to the VCS, the valuation is confirmed or may be revised if there is evidence of a more appropriate estimate of fair value based on available market data. We have performed verification of the inputs and calculations in any valuation models to confirm that the valuations represent reasonable estimates of fair value.

The fixed maturities classified as Level 3 consist of securities for which there are limited or no observable valuation inputs. For Level 3 securities that are investment grade, we estimate the fair value of these securities by obtaining non-binding broker quotes from a limited number of brokers. These brokers base their quotes on a combination of their knowledge of the current pricing environment and market conditions. We consider these inputs to be unobservable. For Level 3 investments that are below-investment-grade securities, we consider a variety of significant valuation inputs in the valuation process, including forward exchange rates, yen swap rates, dollar swap rates, interest rate volatilities, credit spread data on specific issuers, assumed default and default recovery rates, and certain probability assumptions. In obtaining these valuation inputs, we have determined that certain pricing assumptions and data used by our pricing sources are difficult to validate or corroborate by the market and/or appear to be internally developed rather than observed in or corroborated by the market. The use of these unobservable valuation inputs causes more subjectivity in the valuation process for these securities.

For the periods presented, we have not adjusted the quotes or prices we obtain from the pricing services and brokers we use.

The following tables present the pricing sources for the fair values of our fixed maturities, perpetual securities, and equity securities as of December 31.






The following is a discussion of the determination of fair value of our remaining financial instruments.

Derivatives

We use derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets. However, the derivative instrument may not be classified in the same fair value hierarchy level as the associated asset. Inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency forward and spot rates, and interest volatility.

The fair values of the foreign currency forwards, options, and interest rate swaptions associated with certain fixed-maturity securities; the foreign currency forwards and options used to hedge foreign exchange risk from our net investment in Aflac Japan and economically hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen; and the foreign currency swaps associated with certain senior notes and our subordinated debentures are based on the amounts we would expect to receive or pay. The determination of the fair value of these derivatives is based on observable market inputs, therefore they are classified as Level 2.

For derivatives associated with VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary, we are not the direct counterparty to the swap contracts. As a result, the fair value measurements incorporate the credit risk of the collateral associated with the VIE. We receive valuations from a third party pricing vendor for these derivatives. Based on an analysis of these derivatives and a review of the methodology employed by the pricing vendor, we determined that due to the long duration of these swaps and the need to extrapolate from short-term observable data to derive and measure long-term inputs, certain inputs, assumptions and judgments are required to value future cash flows that cannot be corroborated by current inputs or current observable market data. As a result, the derivatives associated with our consolidated VIEs are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Other policyholders' funds

The largest component of the other policyholders' funds liability is our annuity line of business in Aflac Japan. Our annuities have fixed benefits and premiums. For this product, we estimated the fair value to be equal to the cash surrender value. This is analogous to the value paid to policyholders on the valuation date if they were to surrender their policy. We periodically check the cash value against discounted cash flow projections for reasonableness. We consider our inputs for this valuation to be unobservable and have accordingly classified this valuation as Level 3.

Notes payable

The fair values of our publicly issued notes payable classified as Level 3 were obtained from a limited number of independent brokers. These brokers base their quotes on a combination of their knowledge of the current pricing environment and market conditions. We consider these inputs to be unobservable. The fair values of our yen-denominated loans approximate their carrying values.

(c) Based on

The following is a discussion of the significant unobservable inputs or valuation technique used in determining the fair value of securities and derivatives classified as Level 3.

Net Asset Value

We hold certain unlisted equity securities whose fair value is derived based on the financial statements published by the investee. These securities do not trade on an active market and the valuations derived are dependent on the availability of timely financial reporting of the investee. Net asset value is an unobservable input in the determination of fair value of

equity securities.

Offered Quotes

In circumstances where our valuation model price is overridden because it implies a value that is not consistent with current market conditions, we will solicit bids from a limited number of brokers. We also receive unadjusted prices from brokers for our mortgage and asset-backed securities. These quotes are non-binding but are reflective of valuation best estimates at that particular point in time. Offered quotes are an unobservable input in the determination of fair value of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, certain banks/financial institutions, certain other corporate, and equity securities investments.

Interest Rates, CDS Spreads, Foreign Exchange Rates

The significant drivers of the valuation of the interest and foreign exchange swaps are interest rates, foreign exchange rates and CDS spreads. Our swaps have long maturities that increase the sensitivity of the swaps to interest rate fluctuations. Since most of our yen-denominated cross currency swaps are in a net liability position, an increase in interest rates will decrease the liabilities and increase the value of the swap.

Foreign exchange swaps also have a lump-sum final settlement of foreign exchange principal receivables at the termination of the swap.  An increase in yen interest rates will decrease the value of the final settlement foreign exchange receivables and decrease the value of the swap, and an increase in U.S. dollar interest rates increase the swap value.

A similar sensitivity pattern is observed for the foreign exchange rates.  When the spot U.S. dollar/Japanese yen (USD/JPY) foreign exchange rate decreases and the swap is receiving a final exchange payment in JPY, the swap value will increase due to the appreciation of the JPY. Most of our swaps are designed to receive payments in JPY at the termination and will thus be impacted by the USD/JPY foreign exchange rate in this way. In cases where there is no final foreign exchange receivable in JPY and we are paying JPY as interest payments and receiving USD, a decrease in the foreign exchange rate will lead to a decrease in the swap value.

The extinguisher feature in most of our swaps results in a cessation of cash flows and no further payments between the parties to the swap in the event of a default on the referenced or underlying collateral. To price this feature, we apply the survival probability of the referenced entity to the projected cash flows. The survival probability uses the CDS spreads and recovery rates to adjust the present value of the cash flows. For extinguisher swaps with positive values, an increase in CDS spreads decreases the likelihood of receiving the final exchange payments and reduces the value of the swap.

Due to the long duration of these swaps and the need to extrapolate from short-term observable data to derive and measure long-term inputs, certain inputs, assumptions and judgments are required to value future cash flows that cannot be corroborated by current inputs or current observable market data.

Interest rates, CDS spreads, and foreign exchange rates are unobservable inputs in the determination of fair value of foreign currency swaps.

Base Correlations, CDS Spreads, Recovery Rates

Our remaining CDO is a tranche on a basket of single-name credit default swaps. The risk in this synthetic CDO comes from the single-name CDS risk and the correlations between the single names. The valuation of synthetic CDOs is dependent on the calibration of market prices for interest rates, single name CDS default probabilities and base correlation using financial modeling tools. Since there is limited or no observable data available for this tranche, the base correlations must be obtained from commonly traded market tranches such as the CDX and iTraxx indices. From the historical prices of these indices, base correlations can be obtained to develop a pricing curve of CDOs with different seniorities. Since the reference entities of the market indices do not match those in the portfolio underlying the synthetic CDO to be valued, several processing steps are taken to map the CDO in our portfolio to the indices. With the base


correlation determined and the appropriate spreads selected, a valuation is calculated. An increase in the CDS spreads in the underlying portfolio leads to a decrease in the value due to higher probability of defaults and losses. The impact on the valuation due to base correlation depends on a number of factors, including the riskiness between market tranches and the modeled tranche based on our portfolio and the equivalence between detachment points in these tranches. Generally speaking, an increase in base correlation will decrease the value of the senior tranches while increasing the value of junior tranches. This may result in a positive or negative value change.

The CDO tranche in our portfolio is a senior mezzanine tranche and, due to the low level of credit support for this type of tranche, exhibits equity-like behavior. As a result, an increase in recovery rates tends to cause its value to decrease.

Base correlations, CDS spreads, and recovery rates are unobservable inputs in the determination of fair value of credit default swaps.

, unearned premiums consisted primarily of discounted advance premiums on deposit. Discounted advance premiums are premiums on deposit from policyholders in conjunction with their purchase of certain Aflac Japan limited-pay insurance products. These advanced premiums are deferred upon collection and recognized as premium revenue over the contractual premium payment period. These advanced premiums represented

77%

of the December 31,


and

80%

of the December 31,


unearned premiums balances.

As of December 31,


and


, the largest component of the other policyholders' funds liability is our annuity line of business in Aflac Japan. Our annuities have fixed benefits and premiums. These annuities represented

98%

of the December 31,


and


other policyholders' funds liability.


8.   REINSURANCE

We enter into fixed quota-share coinsurance agreements with other companies in the normal course of business. For each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Reinsurance premiums and benefits paid or provided are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Premiums and benefits are reported net of insurance ceded.

Effective March 31, 2015, we entered into a coinsurance transaction whereby we ceded

30.0%

of the sickness hospital benefit of one of Aflac Japan’s closed in-force blocks of business. In December 2015, we entered into an agreement for an

$80 million

letter of credit as collateral for this reinsurance transaction (see Note 13 for additional information). Effective April 1, 2015, we entered into a retrocession coinsurance transaction whereby we assumed

27.0%

of the sickness hospital benefit of one of Aflac Japan’s closed in-force blocks of business through our subsidiary CAIC.

Effective October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2013, we entered into coinsurance reinsurance transactions whereby we ceded

16.7%

and

33.3%

, respectively, of the hospital benefit of one of Aflac Japan’s closed medical in-force blocks of business. Effective December 31, 2014, we entered into a retrocession coinsurance reinsurance transaction whereby we assumed

8.35%

of the reinsured hospital benefit of one of Aflac Japan’s closed medical in-force blocks of business through our subsidiary CAIC.

For our reinsurance transactions to date, we have recorded a deferred profit liability related to the reinsurance transactions. The remaining deferred profit liability of

$786 million

, as of

December 31, 2015

, included in future policy benefits in the consolidated balance sheet, is being amortized into income over the expected lives of the policies. We also have recorded a reinsurance recoverable for reinsurance transactions, which is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and had a remaining balance of

$805 million

as of

December 31, 2015

.

The following table reconciles direct premium income and direct benefits and claims to net amounts after the effect of reinsurance for the years ended December 31.

These reinsurance transactions are indemnity reinsurance that do not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders. In the event that the reinsurer is unable to meet their obligations, we remain liable for the reinsured claims.

As a part of our capital contingency plan, we entered into a committed reinsurance facility agreement on December 1, 2015 in the amount of approximately

110 billion

yen. This reinsurance facility agreement is effective from December 1, 2015 until December 31, 2016. There are also additional commitment periods of a one-year duration each which are automatically extended unless notification is received from the reinsurer within 60 days prior to the expiration. The


reinsurer can withdraw from the committed facility if Aflac‘s Standard and Poor's (S&P) rating drops below BBB-. As of December 31, 2015, we have not executed a reinsurance treaty under this committed reinsurance facility.

9. NOTES PAYABLE

A summary of notes payable as of December 31 follows:

(1)

Principal amount plus an issuance premium that is being amortized over the life of the notes

(2)

Redeemed in April 2015

(3)

Principal amount net of an issuance discount that is being amortized over the life of the notes

In March 2015, the Parent Company issued

two

series of senior notes totaling

$1.0 billion

through a U.S. public debt offering. The first series, which totaled

$550 million

, bears interest at a fixed rate of

2.40%

per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a

five

-year maturity. The second series, which totaled

$450 million

, bears interest at a fixed rate of

3.25%

per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a

ten

-year maturity. We have entered into cross-currency swaps that convert the U.S. dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes into yen-denominated obligations which results in lower nominal net interest rates on the debt. By entering into these cross-currency swaps, we economically converted our

$550 million

liability into a

67.0 billion

yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from

2.40%

in dollars to

.24%

in yen, and we economically converted our

$450 million

liability into a

55.0 billion

yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from

3.25%

in dollars to

.82%

in yen. In April 2015, the Parent Company used the proceeds from the March 2015 issuance of its fixed-rate senior notes to redeem

$850 million

of our

8.50%

fixed-rate senior notes due May 2019 and to pay a portion of the corresponding

$230 million

make-whole premium due to the investors of these notes.

In November 2014, the Parent Company issued

$750 million

of senior notes through a U.S. public debt offering.  The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of

3.625%

per annum, payable semi-annually, and have a

ten

-year maturity.

These notes are redeemable at our option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (ii) the amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal of and interest on the notes to be redeemed, not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of such redemption date, discounted to such redemption date on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate plus 20 basis points, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed to, but excluding, such redemption date.

We entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to reduce interest expense by converting the U.S. dollar-denominated principal and interest on the


senior notes we issued into yen-denominated obligations. By entering into the swaps, we economically converted our

$750 million

liability into an

85.3 billion

yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from

3.625%

in dollars to

1.00%

in yen.

In June 2013, the Parent Company issued

$700 million

of senior notes through a U.S. public debt offering. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of

3.625%

per annum, payable semi-annually, and have a

ten

-year maturity.

These notes are redeemable at our option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (ii) the amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal of and interest on the notes to be redeemed, not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of such redemption date, discounted to such redemption date on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate plus 20 basis points, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed to, but excluding, such redemption date.

We entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to reduce interest expense by converting the U.S. dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes we issued into yen-denominated obligations. By entering into these swaps, we economically converted our

$700 million

liability into a

69.8 billion

yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from

3.625%

in dollars to

1.50%

in yen.

In September 2012, the Parent Company issued

$450 million

of subordinated debentures through a U.S. public debt offering. The debentures bear interest at a fixed rate of

5.50%

per annum, payable quarterly, and have a


-year maturity.   In five years, on or after

September 26, 2017

, we may redeem the debentures, in whole or in part, at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption; provided that if the debentures are not redeemed in whole, at least

$25 million

aggregate principal amount of the debentures must remain outstanding after giving effect to such redemption.  The debentures may only be redeemed prior to

September 26, 2017

, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain tax events or certain rating agency events, as specified in the indenture governing the terms of the debentures.  We entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert the U.S. dollar-denominated principal and interest on the subordinated debentures we issued into yen-denominated obligations.  By entering into these swaps, we economically converted our

$450 million

liability into a

35.3 billion

yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from

5.50%

in dollars to

4.41%

in yen.  The swaps will expire after the initial

five

-year non-callable period for the debentures.  In

October 2012

, the underwriters exercised their option, pursuant to the underwriting agreement, to purchase an additional

$50 million

principal amount of the debentures discussed above.  We entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap to economically convert this

$50 million

liability into a

3.9 billion

yen liability and reduce the interest rate from

5.50%

in dollars to

4.42%

in yen.  The swap will expire after the initial

five

-year non-callable period for the debentures.

In February 2012, the Parent Company issued

two

series of senior notes totaling

$750 million

through a U.S. public debt offering.  The first series, which totaled

$400 million

, bears interest at a fixed rate of

2.65%

per annum, payable semiannually, and has a

five

-year maturity.  The second series, which totaled

$350 million

, bears interest at a fixed rate of

4.00%

per annum, payable semiannually, and has a

ten

-year maturity.  These notes are redeemable at our option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) the principal amount of the notes or (ii) the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  We entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to reduce interest expense by converting the U.S. dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes we issued into yen-denominated obligations. By entering into these swaps, we economically converted our

$400 million

liability into a

30.9 billion

yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from

2.65%

in dollars to

1.22%

in yen.  We also economically converted our

$350 million

liability into a

27.0 billion

yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from

4.00%

in dollars to

2.07%

in yen. In July 2012, the Parent Company issued

$250 million

of senior notes that are an addition to the original first series of senior notes issued in February 2012. These notes have a

five

-year maturity and a fixed rate of

2.65%

per annum, payable semiannually.

In July 2011, the Parent Company issued

three

series of Samurai notes totaling

50.0 billion

yen through a public debt offering. The first series, which totaled

28.7 billion

yen, and the third series, which totaled

5.5 billion

yen, were redeemed in July 2014. The second series, which totaled

15.8 billion

yen, bears interest at a fixed rate of

1.84%

per annum, payable semiannually, and has a

five

-year maturity. These Samurai notes are not available to U.S. persons.

In 2010 and 2009, we issued senior notes through U.S. public debt offerings; the details of these notes are as follows. In August 2010, we issued

$450 million

and

$300 million

of senior notes that have


-year and

five

-year maturities, respectively. In August 2015, we paid off the

$300 million

senior notes upon their maturity. In December 2009, we issued

$400 million

of senior notes that have a


-year maturity. In May 2009, we issued

$850 million

of senior notes that had a

ten

-year maturity, and subsequently redeemed these notes in April 2015 using proceeds from the March 2015 issuance of fixed-rate senior notes. These senior notes pay interest semiannually and are redeemable at our option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) the principal amount of the notes or (ii)


the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

In September 2006, the Parent Company issued a tranche of Uridashi notes totaling

10 billion

yen with a

ten

-year maturity. These Uridashi notes pay interest semiannually, may only be redeemed prior to maturity upon the occurrence of a tax event as specified in the respective bond agreement and are not available to U.S. persons. During 2009, we extinguished

2.0 billion

yen (par value) of these Uridashi notes by buying the notes on the open market at a cost of

1.4 billion

yen, yielding a gain of

.6 billion

yen.

In August 2015, we paid off a

5.0 billion

yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately

$41 million

using the exchange rate at the maturity date). In July 2015, we paid off a

10.0 billion

yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately

$81 million

using the exchange rate at the maturity date).

For our yen-denominated notes and loans, the principal amount as stated in dollar terms will fluctuate from period to period due to changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. We have designated the majority of our yen-denominated notes payable as a nonderivative hedge of the foreign currency exposure of our investment in Aflac Japan.

The aggregate contractual maturities of notes payable during each of the years after

December 31, 2015

, are as follows:

In October 2015, the Parent Company and Aflac jointly entered into a

364 days

uncommitted bilateral line of credit that provides for borrowings in the amount of

$100 million

.

Borrowings will bear interest at the rate quoted by the bank and agreed upon at the time of making such loan and will have a three-month maturity period.

There are no related facility fees, upfront expenses or financial covenant requirements. Borrowings under this credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the financing agreement will mature no later than three months after the last drawdown date of October 15, 2016. As of

December 31, 2015

, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our

$100 million

credit agreement.

In September 2015, we amended and restated our

50.0 billion

yen senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement, due to expire in March 2018, pursuant to which the Parent Company and Aflac jointly entered into a new

five

-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that provides for borrowings of up to

55.0 billion

yen or the equivalent of yen in U.S. dollars on a revolving basis. This credit agreement provides for borrowings in Japanese yen or the equivalent of Japanese yen in U.S. dollars on a revolving basis.

Borrowings bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a eurocurrency rate determined by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds effective rate plus ½ of 1%, (2) the rate of interest for such day announced by Mizuho Bank, Ltd. as its prime rate and (3) the eurocurrency rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin.  The applicable margin ranges between .79% and 1.275% for eurocurrency rate borrowings and 0.0% and .275% for base rate borrowings, depending on the Parent Company’s debt ratings as of the date of determination.

In addition, the Parent Company and Aflac are required to pay a facility fee on the commitments ranging between

.085%

and

.225%

, also based on the Parent Company’s debt ratings as of the date of determination.  Borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including a capital contingency plan for the operations of the Parent Company and Aflac.  The amended and restated credit facility requires compliance with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis and will expire on the earlier of (a) September 18, 2020, or (b) the date the commitments are terminated pursuant to an event of default, as such term is defined in the credit agreement. As of

December 31, 2015

, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our

55.0 billion

yen revolving credit agreement.


In February 2015, the Parent Company and Aflac jointly entered into an uncommitted bilateral line of credit with a third party that provides for borrowings in the amount of

$50 million

.

Borrowings will bear interest at the rate quoted by the bank and agreed upon at the time of making such loan and will have a three-month maturity period.

There are no related facility fees, upfront expenses or financial covenant requirements. Borrowings under this credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. As of

December 31, 2015

, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our

$50 million

credit agreement.

We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable and lines of credit at

December 31, 2015

.

No

10.   INCOME TAXES

The components of income tax expense (benefit) applicable to pretax earnings for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

Japan enacted an income tax rate reduction effective for fiscal years beginning after March 31, 2012. The rate was reduced to

33.3%

effective April 1, 2012, and an additional reduction to

30.8%

became effective January 1, 2015.

Income tax expense in the accompanying statements of earnings varies from the amount computed by applying the expected U.S. tax rate of

35%

to pretax earnings. The principal reasons for the differences and the related tax effects for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

Total income tax expense for the years ended December 31 was allocated as follows:


The tax effect on other comprehensive income (loss) shown in the table above included a deferred income tax expense of

$614 million

in 2013, related to certain U.S. dollar-denominated investments that Aflac Japan maintained on behalf of Aflac U.S. As discussed in Note 1, prior to October 1, 2013, there was no translation adjustment to record in pretax other comprehensive income for the portfolio when the yen/dollar exchange rate changed, however deferred tax expense or benefit associated with the foreign exchange translation gains or losses on these U.S. dollar-denominated investments is recognized in total income tax expense on other comprehensive income until the securities mature or are sold. Excluding the tax amounts for these U.S. dollar-denominated investments from total taxes on other comprehensive income would result in an effective income tax rate on pretax other comprehensive income (loss) of

31%

in 2013.

The income tax effects of the temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 were as follows:


Under U.S. income tax rules,

only 35% of non-life operating losses can be offset against life insurance taxable income each year

. For current U.S. income tax purposes, there were non-life operating loss carryforwards of

$1 million

expiring in 2035, and

no

tax credit carryforwards available at

December 31, 2015

. The Company did not have any capital loss carryforwards available to offset capital gains at

December 31, 2015

.

We file federal income tax returns in the United States and Japan as well as state or prefecture income tax returns in various jurisdictions in the two countries. U.S. federal income tax returns for years before 2011 are no longer subject to examination. In Japan, the National Tax Agency (NTA) has completed exams through tax year 2012.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows for the years ended December 31:

Included in the balance of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits at

December 31, 2015

, are

$261 million

of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility, compared with

$307 million

at

December 31, 2014

. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate, but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. The Company has accrued approximately

$3 million

as of

December 31, 2015

, for permanent uncertainties, which if reversed would not have a material effect on the annual effective rate.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We recognized approximately

$11 million

in interest and penalties in


,


and


. The Company has accrued approximately

$22 million

for the payment of interest and penalties as of

December 31, 2015

, compared with

$30 million

a year ago.

As of

December 31, 2015

, there were no material uncertain tax positions for which the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

The following table is a reconciliation of the number of shares of the Company's common stock for the years ended December 31.


Outstanding share-based awards are excluded from the calculation of weighted-average shares used in the computation of basic EPS. The following table presents the approximate number of share-based awards to purchase shares, on a weighted-average basis, that were considered to be anti-dilutive and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share at December 31:

The weighted-average shares used in calculating earnings per share for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

Share Repurchase Program:

During


, we purchased

21.2 million

shares of our common stock in the open market, compared with

19.7 million

shares in


and

13.2 million

shares in


. In August 2015, our board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional

40.0 million

shares of our common stock. As of

December 31, 2015

, a remaining balance of

48.4 million

shares of our common stock was available for purchase under share repurchase authorizations by our board of directors.

Voting Rights:

In accordance with the Parent Company's articles of incorporation, shares of common stock are generally entitled to

one

vote per share until they have been held by the same beneficial owner for a continuous period of

48 months

, at which time they become entitled to


votes per share.

12. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company has outstanding share-based awards under

two

long-term incentive compensation plans.

The first plan, which expired in February 2007, is a stock option plan which allowed grants for incentive stock options (ISOs) to employees and non-qualifying stock options (NQSOs) to employees and non-employee directors. The options have a term of


years. The exercise price of options granted under this plan is equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. Options granted before the plan's expiration date remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.

The second long-term incentive compensation plan allows awards to Company employees for ISOs, NQSOs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights. Non-employee directors are eligible for grants of NQSOs, restricted stock, and stock appreciation rights. The ISOs and NQSOs have a term of


years, and the share-based awards generally vest upon time-based conditions or time- and performance-based conditions. Time-based vesting generally occurs after

three

years. Performance-based vesting conditions generally include the attainment of goals related to Company financial performance. As of

December 31, 2015

, approximately

10.1 million

shares were available for future grants under this plan, and the only performance-based awards issued and outstanding were restricted stock awards.

Share-based awards granted to U.S.-based grantees are settled with authorized but unissued Company stock, while those issued to Japan-based grantees are settled with treasury shares.

The following table presents the impact of the expense recognized in connection with share-based awards for the periods ended December 31.


We estimate the fair value of each stock option granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton multiple option approach. Expected volatility is based on historical periods generally commensurate with the estimated terms of the options. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and termination patterns within the model. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise patterns are stratified and considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of our option model and represents the weighted-average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. We base the risk-free interest rate on the Treasury note rate with a term comparable to that of the estimated term of the options. The weighted-average fair value of options at their grant date was

$9.46

per share for


, compared with

$16.24

for


and

$14.25

in


. The following table presents the assumptions used in valuing options granted during the years ended December 31.

The following table summarizes stock option activity.


The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at

December 31, 2015

.

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the quoted closing common stock price of

$59.90

as of

December 31, 2015

, for those awards that have an exercise price currently below the closing price. As of

December 31, 2015

, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding was

$76 million

, with a weighted-average remaining term of

4.5

years. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercisable at that same date was

$72 million

, with a weighted-average remaining term of

3.3

years.

The following table summarizes stock option activity during the years ended December 31.

The value of restricted stock awards is based on the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. The following table summarizes restricted stock activity during the years ended December 31.

As of

December 31, 2015

, total compensation cost not yet recognized in our financial statements related to restricted stock awards was

$44 million

, of which

$20 million

(

849 thousand

shares) was related to restricted stock awards with a performance-based vesting condition. We expect to recognize these amounts over a weighted-average period of approximately

1.1

years. There are no other contractual terms covering restricted stock awards once vested.


13. STATUTORY ACCOUNTING AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

Our insurance subsidiaries are required to report their results of operations and financial position to state insurance regulatory authorities on the basis of statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by such authorities. Statutory accounting practices primarily differ from U.S. GAAP by charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different actuarial assumptions as well as valuing investments and certain assets and accounting for deferred taxes on a different basis.

Aflac, the Company's most significant insurance subsidiary, reports statutory financial statements that are prepared on the basis of accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Nebraska Department of Insurance (NEDOI). The NEDOI recognizes statutory accounting principles and practices prescribed or permitted by the state of Nebraska for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company, and for determining a company's solvency under Nebraska insurance law. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC)

Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual

(SAP) has been adopted by the state of Nebraska as a component of those prescribed or permitted practices. Additionally, the Director of the NEDOI has the right to permit other specific practices which deviate from prescribed practices. Aflac has been given explicit permission by the Director of the NEDOI for two such permitted practices. These permitted practices, which do not impact the calculation of net income on a statutory basis or prevent the triggering of a regulatory event in the Company's risk-based capital calculation, are as follows:

•

Aflac has reported as admitted assets the refundable lease deposits on the leases of commercial office space which house Aflac Japan's sales operations. These lease deposits are unique and part of the ordinary course of doing business in the country of Japan; these assets would be non-admitted under SAP.

•

Aflac entered into a reinsurance agreement effective March 31, 2015 with a then unauthorized reinsurer. The effective date of this agreement predated the effective date of Nebraska's Amended Credit for Reinsurance statute (44-416) allowing certified reinsurers and also predated the subsequent approval of the agreement's assuming reinsurer as a Certified Reinsurer, which occurred on August 30, 2015 and December 24, 2015, respectively. Aflac has obtained a permitted practice to recognize this treaty and counterparty as Certified Reinsurer for the purpose of determining the collateral required to receive reinsurance reserve credit.

A reconciliation of Aflac's capital and surplus between SAP and practices permitted by the state of Nebraska is shown below:

As of

December 31, 2015

, Aflac's capital and surplus significantly exceeded the required company action level capital and surplus of

$1.3 billion

. As determined on a U.S. statutory accounting basis, Aflac's net income was

$2.3 billion

in


and

$2.4 billion

in


and


.

Aflac Japan must report its results of operations and financial position to the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis as prescribed by the FSA. Capital and surplus of the Japan branch, based on Japanese regulatory accounting practices, was

$4.7 billion

at

December 31, 2015

, compared with

$5.6 billion

at

December 31, 2014

. Japanese regulatory accounting practices differ in many respects from U.S. GAAP. Under Japanese regulatory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are expensed immediately; policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are different; premium income is recognized on a cash basis; different consolidation criteria apply to VIEs; reinsurance is recognized on a different basis; and investments can have a separate accounting classification and treatment referred to as policy reserve matching bonds (PRM).

The Parent Company depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow, primarily in the form of dividends and management fees. Consolidated retained earnings in the accompanying financial statements largely represent the undistributed earnings of our insurance subsidiary. Amounts available for dividends, management fees and other payments to the Parent Company by its insurance subsidiary may fluctuate due to different accounting methods required by regulatory authorities. These payments are also subject to various regulatory restrictions and approvals related to safeguarding the


interests of insurance policyholders. Our insurance subsidiary must maintain adequate risk-based capital for U.S. regulatory authorities and our Japan branch must maintain adequate solvency margins for Japanese regulatory authorities. Additionally, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid to the Parent Company by Aflac without prior approval of Nebraska's director of insurance is the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or

10%

of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. Dividends declared by Aflac during


in excess of

$2.3 billion

would require such approval. Aflac declared dividends of

$2.4 billion

during


.

A portion of Aflac Japan earnings, as determined on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis, can be repatriated each year to Aflac U.S. after complying with solvency margin provisions and satisfying various conditions imposed by Japanese regulatory authorities for protecting policyholders. Profit repatriations to the United States can fluctuate due to changes in the amounts of Japanese regulatory earnings. Among other items, factors affecting regulatory earnings include Japanese regulatory accounting practices and fluctuations in currency translation of Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-denominated investments and related investment income into yen. Profits repatriated by Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S. were as follows for the years ended December 31:

We entered into foreign exchange forwards and options as part of an economic hedge on foreign exchange risk on

242.5 billion

yen of profit repatriation received in 2015, resulting in

$71 million

of additional funds received when the yen were exchanged into dollars. As of

December 31, 2015

, we had foreign exchange forwards and options as part of a hedging strategy on

124.1 billion

yen of future profit repatriation.

14. BENEFIT PLANS

Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

We have funded defined benefit plans in Japan and the United States, which cover substantially all of our full-time employees. Additionally, we maintain non-qualified, unfunded supplemental retirement plans that provide defined pension benefits in excess of limits imposed by federal tax law for certain Japanese, U.S. and former employees. Effective October 1, 2013, the U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit plan was frozen to new employees hired on or after October 1, 2013 and to employees rehired on or after October 1, 2013. U.S. employees who are not participants in the defined benefit plan receive a nonelective 401(k) employer contribution. Additionally, effective January 1, 2015, the U.S. non-qualified supplemental retirement plan was frozen to new participants.

We provide certain health care benefits for eligible U.S. retired employees, their beneficiaries and covered dependents ("other postretirement benefits"). The health care plan is contributory and unfunded. On October 1, 2013, a change was made to postretirement medical benefits to limit the eligibility for the benefits beginning January 1, 2014 to include the following: (1) active employees whose age plus service, in years, equals or exceeds


(rule of


); (2) active employees who are age


or older and have met the


years of service requirement; (3) active employees who will meet the rule of


in the next

five years

; (4) active employees who are age


or older and who will meet the


years of service requirement within the next

five years

; and (5) current retirees. Effective October 1, 2013, this change was accounted for as a negative plan amendment and resulted in a reduction to the postretirement benefit obligation of approximately

$51 million

, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Starting in the fourth quarter of 2013, this reduction is being amortized as a reduction to net periodic benefit cost over

three years

. The postretirement plan obligation was remeasured using a discount rate of

4.75%

as of October 1, 2013. For certain employees and former employees, additional coverage is provided for all medical expenses for life.

Information with respect to our benefit plans' assets and obligations as of December 31 was as follows:


(1)

Recognized in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets

For the years


,


and


, the health care cost trend rates are expected to trend down to

4.5%

in

78 years

,

4.6%

in

78 years

, and

4.6%

in

78 years

, respectively.

We determine our discount rate assumption for our pension retirement obligations based on indices for AA corporate bonds with an average duration of approximately

20 years

for the Japan pension plans and

17 years

for the U.S. pension plans, and determination of the U.S. pension plans discount rate utilizes the


-year extrapolated yield curve. In Japan,


participant salary and future salary increases are not factors in determining pension benefit cost or the related pension benefit obligation.

We base our assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets on historical trends (


-year or longer historical rates of return for the Japanese plan assets and


-year historical rates of return for the U.S. plan assets), expected future market movement, as well as the portfolio mix of securities in the asset portfolio including, but not limited to, style, class and equity and fixed income allocations. In addition, our consulting actuaries evaluate our assumptions for long-term rates of return under Actuarial Standards of Practice (ASOP). Under the ASOP, the actual portfolio type, mix and class is modeled to determine a best estimate of the long-term rate of return. We in turn use those results to further validate our own assumptions.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point increase and decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects as of

December 31, 2015

:

Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost

Pension and other postretirement benefit expenses, included in acquisition and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended December 31, included the following components:

Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

The following table summarizes the amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss (income) for the years ended December 31:


Prior service credits of

$51 million

were incurred in 2013 for the plan amendment related to the change in eligibility for postretirement medical benefits mentioned above.

No

transition obligations arose during


, and the transition obligations amortized to expense were immaterial for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


. Amortization of actuarial losses to expense in


is estimated to be

$1 million

for the Japanese plans,

$13 million

for the U.S. plans and

$1 million

for the other postretirement benefits plan. Amortization of prior service credits in


is estimated to be

$10 million

for the other postretirement benefits plan due to the negative plan amendment in 2013. The amortization of prior service costs and credits for other plans and transition obligations for all plans is expected to be negligible in


.

Benefit Payments

The following table provides expected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate.

Funding

We plan to make contributions of

$20 million

to the Japanese funded defined benefit plan and

$10 million

to the U.S. funded defined benefit plan in


. The funding policy for our non-qualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits plan is to contribute the amount of the benefit payments made during the year.

Plan Assets

The investment objective of our Japanese and U.S. funded defined benefit plans is to preserve the purchasing power of the plan's assets and earn a reasonable inflation-adjusted rate of return over the long term. Furthermore, we seek to accomplish these objectives in a manner that allows for the adequate funding of plan benefits and expenses. In order to achieve these objectives, our goal is to maintain a conservative, well-diversified and balanced portfolio of high-quality equity, fixed-income and money market securities. As a part of our strategy, we have established strict policies covering quality, type and concentration of investment securities. For our Japanese plan, these policies include limitations on investments in derivatives including futures, options and swaps, and low-liquidity investments such as real estate, venture capital investments, and privately issued securities. For our U.S. plan, these policies prohibit investments in precious metals, limited partnerships, venture capital, and direct investments in real estate. We are also prohibited from trading on margin.

The plan fiduciaries for our funded defined benefit plans have developed guidelines for asset allocations reflecting a percentage of total assets by asset class, which are reviewed on an annual basis. Asset allocation targets as of

December 31, 2015

were as follows:


The following table presents the fair value of Aflac Japan's pension plan assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31. All of these assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, except cash and cash equivalents which are classified as Level 1.

The following table presents the fair value of Aflac U.S.'s pension plan assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31.  All of these assets are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

The fair values of our pension plan investments categorized as Level 1, consisting of mutual funds and common stock, are based on quoted market prices for identical securities traded in active markets that are readily and regularly available to us. The fair values of our pension plan investments classified as Level 2 are based on quoted prices for similar assets in markets that are not active, other inputs that are observable, such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default rates, or other market-corroborated inputs.

401(k) Plan

The Company sponsors a 401(k) plan in which we match a portion of U.S. employees' contributions. The plan provides for salary reduction contributions by employees and, in


,


, and


, provided matching contributions by the Company of

50%

of each employee's contributions which were not in excess of

6%

of the employee's annual cash compensation.


On January 1, 2014, the Company began providing a nonelective contribution to the 401(k) plan of

2%

of annual cash compensation for employees who elected to opt out of the future benefits of the U.S. defined benefit plan during the election period provided during the fourth quarter of 2013 and for new U.S. employees who started working for the Company after September 30, 2013.

The 401(k) contributions by the Company, included in acquisition and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings, were

$9 million

in


,

$7 million

in


and

$5 million

in


. The plan trustee held approximately

one million

shares of our common stock for plan participants at

December 31, 2015

.

Stock Bonus Plan

Aflac U.S. maintains a stock bonus plan for eligible U.S. sales associates. Plan participants receive shares of Aflac Incorporated common stock based on their new annualized premium sales and their first-year persistency of substantially all new insurance policies. The cost of this plan, which was capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs, amounted to

$34 million

in


, compared with

$36 million

in 2014 and

$38 million

in


.

We are a defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the normal course of business. Members of our senior legal and financial management teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. The final results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. Although some of this litigation is pending in states where large punitive damages,


bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs, have been awarded in recent years, we believe the outcome of pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
