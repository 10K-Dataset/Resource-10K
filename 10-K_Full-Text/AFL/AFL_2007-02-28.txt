General Description

Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) was
incorporated in 1973 under the laws of the state of Georgia. Aflac Incorporated
is a general business holding company and acts as a management company,
overseeing the operations of its subsidiaries by providing management services
and making capital available. Its principal business is supplemental health and
life insurance, which is marketed and administered through its subsidiary,
American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in
the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of
Aflac’s policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent
agents. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service
the two markets for our insurance business.

We believe Aflac is the world’s leading
writer of individually issued policies marketed at worksites. We continue to
diversify our product offerings in both Japan and the United States. Aflac
Japan sells cancer plans, care plans, general medical indemnity plans,
medical/sickness riders, living benefit life plans, ordinary life insurance
plans and annuities. Aflac U.S. sells cancer plans and various types of health
insurance, including accident/disability, fixed-benefit dental, sickness and
hospital indemnity, vision care, hospital intensive care, long-term care,
ordinary life, and short-term disability plans.

We are authorized to conduct insurance
business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, several U.S. territories
and Japan. Aflac Japan accounted for 72% of the Company’s total revenues in
2006, 74% in 2005 and 75% in 2004. The percentage of total assets attributable
to Aflac Japan was 82% at both December 31, 2006 and 2005. For additional
information see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
this report.

Insurance Products - Japan

Aflac Japan’s insurance products are designed to help consumers pay for
medical and nonmedical costs that are not reimbursed under Japan’s national
health insurance system. Changes in Japan’s economy and an aging population
have put increasing pressure on Japan’s national health care system. As a
result, more costs are being shifted to Japanese consumers, who in turn have
become increasingly interested in insurance products that help them manage
those costs. Aflac Japan has responded to this consumer need by enhancing
existing products and developing new products.

Aflac Japan’s stand-alone medical product, EVER, offers a basic level
of hospitalization coverage with an affordable premium. We introduced two new
versions of EVER in early 2005: EVER Half and EVER Bonus. EVER Half is a
whole-life medical policy with benefits similar to the original EVER product. With
EVER Half, premiums are cut in half when the policyholder reaches age 60 or 65.
EVER Bonus has all of the same features of EVER Half, but also provides a bonus
payment every 10 years unless the hospitalization benefit was paid for 10
or more consecutive days. In addition, EVER Bonus provides a death benefit and
a cash surrender value. We continue to believe that the medical category will
be an important part of our product portfolio.

The cancer life insurance plans we offer in Japan provide a lump-sum
benefit upon initial diagnosis of internal cancer and a fixed daily benefit for
hospitalization and outpatient services related to cancer as well as surgical,
convalescent and terminal care benefits. These plans differ from Aflac U.S.
cancer plans in that the Japanese policies may also provide death benefits and
cash surrender values. In 2006, we designed a new cancer product for distribution
by Dai-ichi Life that is customized for their market. In 2005, we introduced a
new cancer insurance product that incorporates a wellness benefit, while also
increasing the daily outpatient benefit to the same level as the
hospitalization

I-



benefit. Our Rider MAX product provides
accident and medical/sickness benefits as a rider to our cancer life policy.

The life products that we offer in Japan provide death benefits and
cash surrender values. These products are available as stand-alone policies and
riders. We introduced a new product called WAYS in early 2006. WAYS is a life
insurance policy that allows policyholders to convert a portion of their life
insurance to medical, nursing care, or fixed annuity benefits at a
predetermined age.

We also offer traditional fixed-income
annuities and care policies. For additional information on Aflac Japan’s
products and composition of sales, see the Aflac Japan section of MD&A in
this report.

Insurance Products - U.S.

We design our U.S. insurance products to provide supplemental coverage
for people who already have major medical or primary insurance coverage. The
policies are portable and pay regardless of other insurance. Our health
insurance plans are guaranteed-renewable for the lifetime of the policyholder
(to age 70 for short-term disability policies). We cannot cancel
guaranteed-renewable coverage, but we can increase premium rates on existing
policies on a uniform, nondiscriminatory basis by class of policy in response
to adverse experience. Any premium rate increases are subject to state
regulatory approval. We have had minimal rate increase activity in the last
five years.

Aflac U.S. offers an accident and disability policy to protect against
losses resulting from accidents. The accident portion of the policy includes
lump-sum benefits for accidental death, dismemberment, and specific injuries as
well as fixed benefits for hospital confinement. Optional disability riders are
also available. Short-term disability policies provide disability benefits with
a variety of elimination and benefit period options. The longest such benefit
period offered is two years.

Our U.S. cancer plans are designed to provide insurance benefits for
medical and nonmedical costs that are not covered by major medical insurance. Benefits
include a first-occurrence benefit that pays an initial amount when internal
cancer is first diagnosed; a fixed amount for each day an insured is
hospitalized for cancer treatment; fixed amounts for radiation, chemotherapy,
and surgery; and a wellness benefit applicable toward certain diagnostic tests.

Our hospital indemnity products provide fixed daily benefits for
hospitalization due to accident or sickness. In 2005, we introduced a new
version of our hospital indemnity plan. Indemnity benefits for inpatient and
outpatient surgeries, as well as various other diagnostic expenses, are also
available. Our sickness indemnity plan provides a fixed daily benefit for
hospitalization due to sickness and fixed amounts for physician services for
accident or sickness.

In July 2006, we introduced a revised specified health event
policy that gives consumers three benefit and premium levels from which they
may select. One of the levels combines the new specified health event policy
with our intensive care plan. By leveraging administrative efficiencies,
consumers can purchase the combined coverage for less money than if they had
purchased the policies separately.

I-



Aflac U.S. offers term and whole-life policies sold through payroll
deduction at the worksite and various term and whole-life policies on a direct
basis. In early 2006, we introduced a revised life insurance portfolio called
the Life Protector Series. This product line offers term policies with varying
duration options and a new whole-life policy with additional benefits,
including an increased face value option. These revisions greatly enhanced the
product category and contributed to its success in the marketplace.

We also offer a series of fixed-benefit dental policies, providing
various levels of benefits for dental procedures, including checkups and
cleanings. Plan features include a renewal guarantee, no deductible and no
network restrictions.

In 2005, we introduced Vision Now

SM

, which provides benefits for serious eye
health conditions and loss of sight. Vision Now includes coverage for
corrective eye materials and exam benefits.

We also offer other health insurance products
including tax qualified and non-qualified long-term care plans. For additional
information on Aflac’s U.S. products and composition of sales, see the Aflac
U.S. section of MD&A in this report.

Distribution - Japan

We sell our products primarily through two distribution channels:
independent/individual agencies and affiliated corporate agencies.

The individual agencies and independent corporate agencies that sell
our products give us better access to workers at the vast number of small
businesses in Japan. Agents’ activities are primarily focused on insurance
sales, with customer service support provided by the Aflac Contact Center. Individual
agencies contributed 58% of total new annualized premium sales in 2006, and 57%
in both 2005 and 2004.

Affiliated corporate agencies are formed when companies establish
subsidiary businesses to sell our insurance products to their employees,
suppliers and customers. These agencies help us reach employees at large worksites,
including 90% of the companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Reflecting
changed employment patterns and consumers’ desire for consultation, Aflac’s
sales growth through large affiliated corporate agencies has slowed for several
years. However, we still consider the corporate channel to be an important part
of our distribution system and believe it is a valuable means for reaching
workers at large employers. To rejuvenate this channel, we are encouraging our
affiliated agencies to move away from passive, or “pull” sales tactics, like
direct mailings and newspaper ads, and instead adopt active, or “push”
techniques that involve more follow-up calls and face-to-face sales
consultations. We are also working to have some of our larger affiliated
agencies form alliances with individual agencies who already have expertise in
a face-to-face sales approach. Affiliated corporate agencies contributed 33% of
total new annualized premium sales in 2006, compared with 35% in 2005 and 36%
in 2004.

To improve the overall effectiveness of our sales force, we started a
new training initiative. This new program uses six months of classroom training
and practical field training to equip sales

I-



associates with the skills necessary for
their success. By the end of 2006, we had trained more than 700 of Aflac Japan’s
field employees, who in turn, are now positioned to train primarily newly
recruited sales associates.

Aflac Service
Shops, which are primarily owned and operated by individual sales agencies, are
gaining in popularity as many consumers in Japan seek one-on-one consultation
and convenience in handling their insurance needs. By the end of 2006, we had 570
Aflac Service Shops throughout Japan.

As of December 31,
2006, there were approximately 18,400 agencies in Japan with more than 90,000
licensed agents, compared with approximately 17,960 agencies and 81,700
licensed agents a year ago. We believe that new agencies will continue to be
attracted to Aflac Japan’s high commissions, superior products, customer
service and brand image.

We also
continued to reach consumers through our strategic marketing alliance with
Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Company (Dai-ichi Life). We believe our alliance
has been one of the most successful partnerships in the insurance industry. In
2006, Dai-ichi Life sold 269,700 of our market leading cancer life policies,
compared with 277,700 policies in 2005 and 244,400 policies in 2004, leading
Dai-ichi to retain its distinction as the number two seller of cancer insurance
behind only Aflac Japan.

We expect that
our distribution system will continue to evolve in Japan. Regulatory changes
that are scheduled to take effect on December 31, 2007 will enable banks
to sell our products to their customers. Although there will undoubtedly be a
lot of competition for the bank distribution channel, we have established
long-term relationships with many banks throughout Japan, and we are excited
about the opportunity to grow our business through this channel beginning in
2008.

For
additional information on Aflac Japan’s distribution, see the Aflac Japan
section of MD&A in this report.

Distribution - U.S.

Our U.S. sales
force comprises sales associates who are independent contractors licensed to
sell accident and health insurance. Many are also licensed to sell life
insurance. Associates are paid personal production commissions based on
first-year and renewal premiums from their sales of insurance products. In
addition to receiving commissions on personal production, associates who serve
as district, regional and state sales coordinators may also receive override
commissions and incentive bonuses. Most associates’ efforts are principally
focused on selling supplemental insurance at the worksite. Administrative
personnel in Georgia, New York, and Nebraska handle policyholder service
functions, including issuance of policies, premium collection, payment notices
and claims.

I-



We concentrate on marketing our products at the worksite. This method
offers policies to individuals through common media such as employment, trade
and other associations. This manner of marketing is distinct from the group
insurance sales approach, as our primary method of enrollment results from the
individual insured being directly contacted by the sales associate. Policies
are individually underwritten, with premiums generally paid by the employee. Additionally,
Aflac policies are portable, meaning that individuals may retain their full
insurance coverage upon separation from employment or such affiliation,
generally at the same premium. We collect a major portion of premiums on such
sales through payroll deduction or other forms of centralized billing. Worksite
marketing enables a sales associate to reach a greater number of prospective
policyholders and lowers distribution costs, compared with individually
marketed business.

During 2004 and 2005, we took several steps to enhance our distribution
system. We concentrated on expanding our sales management infrastructure and
training and recruiting initiatives. In 2006, we continued our focus on
recruiting and training as a means for growing our producer base. During 2006,
recruiting was up 7.8% to approximately 26,100 new sales associates, compared
with 2005. The total number of licensed agents was 8.5% higher at December 31,
2006, compared with year-end 2005.

The goal of our recruiting and training focus has been to increase the
number of sales associates producing business on a weekly basis. We believe
that we can achieve better producer growth through more effective and
standardized training for our sales associates and sales management. As
previously disclosed, we shifted our focus during 2006 from average monthly
producers to average weekly producers as both a reporting and management metric.
This shift enables active management of our sales associates and allows our
sales management to monitor progress and needs on a real-time basis. On a
weekly basis, the average number of U.S. associates actively producing business
during 2006 was 10,300, compared with 9,700 in both 2005 and 2004.

For new sales associates, we continued to implement LEASE training,
which stands for Larger Earnings by Acquiring Smaller Employers. In 2006, we
merged LEASE with the New Associate Training Cycle, combining classroom
instruction, e-learning through

Aflac University

®

and
field training. We believe that combining LEASE into the New Associate Training
Cycle will help get new sales associates off to a quick start.

In addition, associates that exhibit leadership skills are invited to
participate in our national Coordinator in Training (CIT) program, which we
introduced nationwide in July 2005. The goal of the CIT program is to
build a pool of well-trained candidates for the district sales coordinator
(DSC) position, which is the first level of Aflac sales management. As such,
the CIT program concentrates on developing their skills so that they have a
better chance to succeed as a DSC and beyond.

And finally, we introduced an enhanced regional coordinator
accreditation program (RCAP) in 2006. This program was designed for both new
and experienced regional sales coordinators (RSCs). In early 2006, we began
bringing current RSCs to Aflac Worldwide Headquarters for five days of intense
and interactive workshops in areas such as recruiting, leadership, planning,
team building, and technology.

Competition - Japan

In 1974, Aflac became the second non-Japanese life insurance company to
gain direct access to the Japanese insurance market by obtaining an operating
license. Through 1981, we faced limited competition for cancer life insurance
policy sales. However, Japan has experienced two periods of deregulation since
we entered the market. The first came in the early 1980s, when nine mid-sized
insurers, including domestic and foreign, were allowed to sell cancer insurance
products for the first time. In 2001, all life and non-life insurers were
allowed to sell stand-alone cancer and medical insurance products as well as
other stand-alone health insurance products. As a result, the number of
insurance companies offering stand-alone cancer and medical insurance has more
than doubled in the five years since full deregulation. However, based on our
growth of annualized premiums in force and agencies, we do not believe that our
market leading position has been significantly impacted by increased
competition as a result of deregulation. Furthermore, we believe the continued
development and maintenance of operating efficiencies will allow us to offer
affordable products that appeal to consumers.

Aflac has had substantial success selling cancer life policies in
Japan, with 14 million cancer life policies in force as of December 31,
2006. We believe we will remain a leading provider of cancer life insurance
coverage in Japan, principally due to our experience in the market, low-cost
operations, unique marketing system (see Distribution - Japan above) and
product expertise.

We have also experienced substantial success
selling medical insurance in Japan. While other companies have recognized the
opportunities that we have seen in the medical insurance market and offered new
products, we believe our products stand out as a tremendous value to consumers.
Aflac Japan continued to be the number one seller of stand-alone medical
insurance in the life insurance industry in terms of policy sales throughout
the year.

Competition - U.S.

Approximately 2,000 life insurance companies are licensed in the United
States. We compete against several insurers on a national basis plus other
insurers regionally. We believe our policies and premium rates, as well as the
commissions paid to our sales agents, are competitive with those offered by
other companies providing similar types of insurance. However, we believe our
U.S. business is distinct from our competitors because of our product focus,
distribution system, and brand awareness. For many of the other companies that
sell supplemental insurance, it represents a secondary business. For us, it is
our primary business. We also believe that our growing distribution system of
independent sales associates expands our business opportunities, while our
advertising campaigns have increased our name awareness and the effectiveness
of our branding efforts.

Private insurers and voluntary and cooperative
plans, such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield, provide insurance for
hospitalization and medical expenses. Much of this insurance is sold on a group
basis. The federal and state governments also pay substantial costs of medical
treatment through various

I-



programs. Such major medical
insurance generally covers a substantial amount of the medical expenses
incurred by an insured as a result of accident and disability, cancer or other
major illnesses. Aflac’s policies are designed to provide coverage that supplements
major medical insurance and may also be used to defray nonmedical expenses. Thus,
we do not compete directly with major medical insurers. However, the scope of
major medical coverage offered by other insurers does represent a potential
limitation on the market for our products. Accordingly, expansion of coverage
by other insurers or governmental programs could adversely affect our business
opportunities. Conversely, any reduction of coverage, or increased deductibles
and copayments, by other insurers or governmental programs could favorably
affect our business opportunities.

Investments and Investment Results

Net investment income was $2.2 billion in
2006, $2.1 billion in 2005, and $2.0 billion in 2004. Growth of net investment
income during the last three years has been impacted by low available
investment yields for new money in both Japan and the United States. In
particular, Japan’s life insurance industry has contended with low investment
yields for a number of years. Although the Bank of Japan ended its
zero-interest-rate policy in 2006, market yields on long-duration fixed
maturity securities, which we primarily purchase, did not increase
significantly during the year.

Regulation - Japan

The financial and business
affairs of Aflac Japan are subject to examination by Japan’s Financial Services
Agency (FSA). Aflac Japan files annual reports and financial statements for the
Japanese insurance operations based on a March 31 fiscal year end,
prepared in accordance with Japanese regulatory accounting practices prescribed
or permitted by the FSA. Japanese regulatory basis earnings are determined
using accounting principles that differ materially from U.S. GAAP. Under
Japanese regulatory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are charged
off immediately; deferred income tax liabilities are recognized on a different
basis; policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are
different; the carrying value of securities transferred to held to maturity is
different; policyholder protection fund obligations are not accrued; and
premium income is recognized

I-



on a cash basis. Reconciliations of the net
assets of the Japan branch on a U.S. GAAP basis to net assets determined on a
Japanese regulatory accounting basis as of December 31 were as follows:

The FSA maintains a solvency standard, which is used by Japanese
regulators to monitor the financial strength of insurance companies. Aflac
Japan’s solvency margin continues to significantly exceed regulatory minimums.
A portion of Aflac Japan’s annual earnings, as determined on a Japanese
regulatory accounting basis, may be repatriated each year to Aflac U.S. after
complying with solvency margin provisions and satisfying various conditions
imposed by Japan’s regulatory authorities for protecting policyholders. These
repatriated profits represent a portion of Aflac Japan’s after-tax earnings
reported to the FSA on a March 31 fiscal year basis. If needed, we may
elect not to repatriate profits to Aflac U.S. or to repatriate a reduced amount
to strengthen Aflac Japan’s solvency margin. In addition, the FSA may not allow
profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to Aflac U.S. if they would
cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of
Japanese policyholders. We do not expect these requirements to adversely affect
the funds available for profit repatriations. Nor do we expect these
requirements to adversely affect the funds available for payments of allocated
expenses to Aflac U.S. and management fees to the Parent Company.

As disclosed in our third quarter 2006 Form 10-Q, Aflac Japan,
along with the entire life insurance industry, began a review of the last five
years of paid claims to determine if those claims were paid fully and
accurately. In a recent notification from the FSA, the review process has been
changed from a voluntary program to one that is mandatory and has been expanded
to include a review of cash surrender value payments. Additionally, the FSA
established a reporting deadline of April 13, 2007. We expect to complete our
review of claims and cash surrender value payments and report our findings to
the FSA within the time frame specified. As a result of this review, we have
found some payment errors and we are correcting them. Additionally, we are
using this review to identify process changes that will help ensure that payment
errors such as these are not repeated. Although immaterial to our financial
statements, we have provided for our estimate of the underpaid portion of those
claims in our unpaid policy claims liability as of December 31, 2006.

I-



The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection fund that
provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. For additional
information regarding the policyholder protection fund, see the Policyholder
Protection Fund section of MD&A and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in this report.

In October 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing Japan’s postal
system (Japan Post) was enacted into law. Prior to the move to privatize, Japan
Post enjoyed significant advantages over the private sector, which in turn made
competing against it difficult for the private sector. The privatization laws
split Japan Post into four independent entities and generally recognize the
need for a level playing field between Japan Post and the private sector. Specifically,
the laws contain a commitment to implement “measures to ensure equivalent
conditions of competition” between the four privatized Japan Post companies and
other companies “engaged in like business operations.” The laws also require
the postal insurance entity of Japan Post to ultimately be subject to the same
tax and policyholder safety-net contribution requirements as its private
industry competitors. In addition, the insurance entity would also be subject
to Insurance Business Law and FSA supervision. The privatization process is
scheduled to be completed by October 2017.

In July 2006, Japan Post submitted an outline of its privatization
plan to the government. When the new Japan Post financial entities start
operations on October 1, 2007, they will be limited to the products that
they now currently offer. Japan Post is scheduled to submit a full version of
its privatization plan to the government in April 2007. Various government
entities will then review the plan. This review should be completed by the end
of July 2007. After October 2007, any new business proposals would,
in addition to the normal FSA approval process, have to undergo a special
review by Japan’s Postal Privatization Committee and approval by Japan’s Prime
Minister and the Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications.

Our branch in Japan is also subject to
regulation and supervision in the United States (see Regulation - U.S.). For
additional information regarding Aflac Japan’s operations and regulations, see
the Aflac Japan section of MD&A and Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Regulation - U.S.

The Parent Company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to state
regulations in the United States as an insurance holding company system. Such
regulations generally provide that transactions between companies within the
holding company system must be fair and equitable. In addition, transfers of
assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from
insurance subsidiaries, and material transactions between companies within the
system are subject to prior notice to, or approval by, state regulatory
authorities.

I-



Like
all U.S. insurance companies, Aflac is subject to regulation and supervision in
the jurisdictions in which they do business. In general, the insurance laws of
the various jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad
administrative powers relating to, among other things:

·

granting and revoking licenses to transact
business

·

regulating trade practices

·

licensing of agents

·

approval of policy forms and premium rates

·

standards of solvency and maintenance of
specified policy benefit reserves and minimum loss ratio requirements

·

capital requirements

·

limitations on dividends to shareholders

·

the nature of and limitations on investments

·

deposits of securities for the benefit of
policyholders

·

filing of financial statements prepared in
accordance with statutory insurance accounting practices prescribed or
permitted by regulatory authorities

·

periodic examinations of the market conduct,
financial, and other affairs of insurance companies

Additionally, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC) is constantly reviewing regulatory matters and recommending changes and
revisions for adoption by state legislators and insurance departments.

The NAIC uses a risk-based capital formula relating to insurance risk,
business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk to facilitate identification
by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based
upon the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer’s operations. The
formulas for determining the amount of risk-based capital specify various
weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of
activity based on the perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is
determined by a ratio of the Company’s regulatory total adjusted capital to its
authorized control level risk-based capital as defined by the NAIC. Companies
below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels,
each of which requires specified corrective action. The levels are Company
action, regulatory action, authorized control, and mandatory control. Aflac’s
NAIC risk-based capital ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital
and surplus position.

For further information concerning Aflac U.S.
operations, regulation and dividend restrictions, see the Aflac U.S. section of
MD&A and Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in this report.

ITEM1A.

RISK FACTORS.

Risk Factors

We face a wide range of risks, and our continued success depends on our
ability to identify, prioritize and appropriately manage our enterprise risk
exposures. Readers should carefully consider each of the following risks and
all of the other information set forth in this Form 10-K. These risks and
other factors may affect forward-looking statements, including those in this
document or made by the Company elsewhere, such as in earnings release
webcasts, investor conference presentations or press releases. The risks and
uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones facing the Company.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If
any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, it
could have a material impact on the Company.

We operate in an industry that is subject to
ongoing changes.

We operate in a competitive environment and in an industry that is
subject to ongoing changes from market pressures brought about by customer
demands, legislative reform and marketing practices. These factors require us
to anticipate market trends and make changes to differentiate our products and
services from those of our competitors. We also face the potential of
competition from existing or new companies that have not historically been in
the supplemental health insurance industry. Failure to anticipate market trends
and/or to differentiate our products and services can affect our ability to
retain or grow profitable lines of business.

Our concentration of business in Japan poses
risks to our operations.

Our operations in Japan accounted for 72%, 74%, and 75% of our total
revenues for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and 82% of our total assets at
both December 31, 2006 and 2005. As a result, weakness in Japan’s economy
could adversely affect our business. The weak economy in Japan that emerged in
the early 1990s resulted in a challenging marketing environment for Aflac
Japan, with declining available investment yields for new investments and
decreased consumer confidence. Although the Japanese economy has shown signs of
improvement from time to time, the time required for a full recovery remains
uncertain.

I-



Japanese currency translation risk could
adversely impact operating results.

Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our
functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar
exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported financial position
and results of operations. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen
into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens,
translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported.

Aflac Japan’s premiums and most of its investment income are received
in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase
yen-denominated assets to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and
other yen-denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for
financial reporting purposes. However, it is important to distinguish between
translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of
transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view
foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not
an economic event to our Company or shareholders.

General market conditions affect investments
and investment income.

We have substantial investment portfolios that support our policy
liabilities. Low levels of interest rates on investments, such as those
experienced in the United States and Japan during recent years, have negatively
impacted the level of investment income earned by the Company. Slower
investment income growth will occur if a low-interest-rate environment
persists.

Financial market conditions can also affect our realized and unrealized
investment gains or losses. During periods of rising interest rates, the fair
values of our investments will decline. Conversely, during periods of falling
interest rates, the fair values of our investments will rise. However, should
significant amounts of unrealized gains/losses occur because of changes in
market yields, we would not expect to realize significant gains or losses due
to our ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity or recovery of
value.

Availability of acceptable yen-denominated
investments could adversely affect our profits.

We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our
liabilities. At December 31, 2006, the average duration of Aflac Japan’s
policy liabilities and its yen-denominated debt securities was approximately 13
years. When our debt securities mature, there is a risk that the proceeds will
be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion
of policy liabilities. If this occurs, Aflac Japan’s business would be
adversely affected.

Concentration of our investment portfolios in
any particular sector of the economy may have an adverse effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

The concentration of our investment
portfolios in any particular industry, group of related industries or
geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios
and, consequently, on our results of operations and financial position. Events
or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group
of related industries or geographic sector may have a greater adverse effect on
the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated
rather than diversified.

I-



If future policy benefits, claims or expenses
exceed those anticipated in establishing premiums and reserves, our financial
results would be adversely affected.

We establish and carry, as a liability,
reserves based on estimates of how much will be required to pay for future
benefits and claims. We calculate these reserves using various assumptions and
estimates, including premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the
policy; the timing, frequency and severity of the events covered by the
insurance policy; and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with a
portion of our net cash flow from operations. These assumptions and estimates
are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the
ultimate amounts that we will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual
benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities
will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims. If our
actual experience is different from our assumptions or estimates, our reserves
may prove inadequate. As a result, we would incur a charge to earnings in the
period in which we determine such a shortfall exists. This estimation process
is a critical accounting policy for the Company.

Our operating subsidiaries provide cash flow
to the Parent Company.

Aflac Incorporated is a holding company and has no direct operations or
no significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Because we
conduct our operations through our operating subsidiaries, we depend on those
entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to
meet our financial obligations. There is no assurance that the earnings from,
or other available assets of, our operating subsidiaries will be sufficient to
make distributions to us to enable us to operate.

Extensive regulation can impact profitability
and growth.

Aflac’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex laws and
regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of governmental
authorities, including state insurance regulators, the SEC, the NAIC, the FSA,
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in Japan, the U.S. Department of Justice, state
attorneys general, and the Internal Revenue Service, each of which exercises a
degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that
compliance with any particular regulator’s or enforcement authority’s
interpretation of a legal or regulatory issue may not result in compliance with
another regulator’s or enforcement authority’s interpretation of the same
issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. There is also a
risk that any particular regulator’s or enforcement authority’s interpretation
of a legal or regulatory issue may change over time to our detriment. In
addition, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even
absent any particular regulator’s or enforcement authority’s interpretation of
an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need
to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus
necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our
ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our
business.

I-



The
primary purpose of insurance company regulation supervision is the protection
of insurance policyholders, rather than investors. The extent of regulation
varies, but generally is governed by state statutes in the United States and by
the FSA and the MOF in Japan. These systems of supervision and regulation
cover, among other things:

·

standards
of establishing and setting premium rates and the approval thereof

·

standards
of minimum capital requirements and solvency margins, including risk-based
capital measures

·

restrictions
on, limitations on and required approval of certain transactions between our
insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates, including management fee
arrangements

·

restrictions
on the nature, quality and concentration of investments

·

restrictions
on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance
policies offered by our primary insurance operations

·

limitations
on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay or foreign
profits that can be repatriated

·

the
existence and licensing status of the Company under circumstances where it is
not writing new or renewal business

·

certain
required methods of accounting

·

reserves
for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes

·

assignment
of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of
funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies
provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies

·

administrative
practices requirements

·

imposition of fines and other sanctions

Sales of our products and services are
dependent on our ability to attract, retain and support a network of qualified
sales associates.

Our sales could be adversely affected if our sales networks deteriorate
or if we do not adequately provide support, training and education for our
existing network. Competition exists for sales associates with demonstrated
ability. We compete with other insurers and financial institutions primarily on
the basis of our products, compensation, support services and financial rating.
An inability to attract and retain qualified sales associates could have a
material adverse effect on sales and our results of operations and financial
condition. Our sales associates are independent contractors and may sell
products of our competitors. If our competitors offer products that are more
attractive than ours, or pay higher commissions than we do, these sales
associates may concentrate their efforts on selling our competitors’ products
instead of ours.

Success of our business depends in part on
effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and
implement improvements in technology; certain significant multi-year strategic
information technology projects are currently in process.

Our business depends in large part on our
technology systems for interacting with employers, policyholders and sales
associates, and our business strategy involves providing customers with
easy-to-use products to meet their needs. Some of our information technology
systems and software are older, legacy-type systems that are less efficient and
require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade
to current standards (including adequate business continuity procedures). We
are currently developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in
information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards,
and customer demands. Our success is dependent in large part on maintaining or
improving the effectiveness of existing systems and continuing to develop and
enhance information systems that support our business processes in a
cost-efficient manner.

Changes in accounting standards issued by the
FASB or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial
statements.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally
accepted accounting principles in both the United States and Japan, which are
periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new
or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies,
including the FASB. It is possible that future changes we are required to adopt
could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated
financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect
on our results and financial condition.

Any decrease in our financial strength
ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position.

Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the
competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an
insurance company’s business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the
financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change
the outlook on an insurer’s ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurer’s
statutory capital; a change in a rating agency’s determination of the amount of
risk-adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; an increase in
the perceived risk of an insurer’s investment portfolio; a reduced confidence
in management; or other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer’s
control. Because all of our ratings are subject to continuous review, the
retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A multi-level downgrade in any of
these ratings could have a material adverse effect on agent recruiting and
retention, sales, competitiveness, and the marketability of our products
impacting our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.

I-



We face risks related to litigation.

We are a defendant in various lawsuits
considered to be in the normal course of business. Senior legal and financial
management review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. The final results
of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. Although some of this
litigation is pending in states where large punitive damages bearing little
relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs have been awarded in
recent years, we believe the outcome of pending litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows. However, litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs
of defending these cases, costs of settlement or judgments against us or
because of changes in our operations that could result from litigation.

Managing key executive succession is critical
to our success.

We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for
succession of our senior management and other key executives. While we have
succession plans and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these
do not guarantee that the services of these executives will be available to us.

We also face other risks that could adversely affect our business,
results of operations or financial condition, which include:

·

any
requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate
application of accounting principles

·

failure
of our processes to prevent and detect unethical conduct of employees

·

a
significant failure of internal controls over financial reporting

·

failure
of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with
internal policies and regulatory requirements

·

failure of corporate governance policies and
procedures

PROPERTIES.

Aflac owns land and buildings that comprise two primary campuses
located in Columbus, Georgia. These campuses include buildings that serve as
our worldwide headquarters and house administrative support functions for our
U.S. operations. Aflac also leases administrative office space in Georgia, New
York, and Nebraska. In 2005, we announced a multi-year building project for
additional office space in Columbus, Georgia. The initial phase is to be
completed in 2007 and will provide additional space for administrative support
functions. The next phase of the expansion is anticipated to begin in mid-2007.

In Tokyo, Japan, Aflac has two primary
campuses. The first campus includes a building that Aflac owns that serves as
customer service center. The second campus comprises leased space, which serves
as our Japan branch headquarters and houses administrative support functions
for the Japan branch. Aflac also leases additional office space in Tokyo, along
with regional offices located throughout the country.

COMPANY OVERVIEW

Aflac
Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (the Company) primarily
sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The
Company’s insurance business is marketed and administered through American
Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United
States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflac’s
policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents.
Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service
the two markets for our insurance business.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(MD&A) is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the
financial condition and results of operations of Aflac Incorporated and its
subsidiaries for the three-year period ended December 31, 2006. As a
result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements and notes.

This
MD&A is divided into four primary sections. In the first section, we
discuss our critical accounting estimates. We then follow with a discussion of
the results of our operations on a consolidated basis and by segment. The third
section presents an analysis of our financial condition as well as a discussion
of market risks of financial instruments. We conclude by addressing the
availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash in the Capital
Resources and Liquidity section.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

We
prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates based on currently available
information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. The
estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of Aflac’s
results of operations and financial condition are those related to investments,
deferred policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities. The preparation and
evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various
assumptions developed from management’s analyses and judgments. The application
of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 95% of
our assets and 84% of our liabilities are reported and thus have a direct
effect on net earnings and shareholders’ equity. Subsequent experience or use
of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.

Investments

Aflac’s investments in debt and equity
securities include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. For
privately issued securities, we receive pricing data from external sources that
take into account each security’s credit quality and liquidity characteristics.
We also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair
value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. These reviews are
performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in
accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 59, Accounting for
Non-Current Marketable Equity Securities; Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 115,

II-

(FASB) Staff Position 115-1, The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments and
related guidance. The identification of distressed investments, the determination
of fair value if not publicly traded, and the assessment of whether a decline
is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and require
evaluation of factors, including but not limited to:

·

percentage decline in value
and the length of time during which the decline has occurred

·

recoverability of principal
and interest

·

market conditions

·

ability to hold the
investment to maturity

·

review of the issuer’s
overall operating performance

·

rating agency opinions and
actions regarding the issuer’s credit standing

·

adverse changes in the issuer’s
availability of production resources, revenue sources and technological
conditions

·

adverse changes in the issuer’s
economic, regulatory or political environment

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Policy Liabilities

Aflac’s
products are generally long-duration fixed-benefit indemnity contracts. As
such, our products are accounted for under the requirements of SFAS No. 60,
Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises. We make estimates of certain
factors that affect the profitability of our business to match expected policy
benefits and deferrable acquisition costs with expected policy premiums. These
assumptions include persistency, morbidity, mortality, investment yields and expenses.
If actual results match the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities
and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs, profits will emerge as
a level percentage of earned premiums. However, because actual results will
vary from the assumptions, profits as a percentage of earned premiums will vary
from year to year.

We
measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of deferred
policy acquisition costs (DAC) annually by performing gross premium valuations
on our business. Our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are
adequate and that our DAC is recoverable.

Deferred
Policy Acquisition Costs

Under
the requirements of SFAS No. 60, certain costs of acquiring new business
are deferred and amortized over the policy’s premium payment period in
proportion to anticipated premium income. Future amortization of DAC is based
upon our estimates of persistency, interest, and future premium revenue
generally established at the time of policy issuance. However, the unamortized
balance of DAC reflects actual persistency. As presented in the following
table, the ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has been
relatively stable for Aflac U.S. over the last three years. The ratio of
unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has shown a slight upward trend
for Aflac Japan for the last three years. This trend is a result of a greater
proportion of our annualized premiums being under the alternative commission
schedule, which pays a higher commission on first-year premiums and lower
commissions on renewal premiums. This schedule is very popular with our new
agents as it helps them with cash flow for personal and business needs as they
build their

II-



business. While this has resulted in a higher
unamortized DAC balance, the overall cost to the company has been reduced.

Our policy
liabilities, which are determined in accordance with SFAS No. 60 and
Actuarial Standards of Practice, include two primary components:  future policy benefits and unpaid policy
claims, which accounted for 90% and 5% of total policy liabilities as of December 31,
2006, respectively.

Future policy
benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally
calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less
the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. We calculate future
policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and
interest. These assumptions are generally established at the time a policy

II-



is
issued. The assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those
used in developing the gross premiums for a policy. As required by GAAP, we
also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to
accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience.

Unpaid policy
claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of
payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have
not yet been reported to us. We compute unpaid policy claims on an undiscounted
basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for
current trends and changed conditions. We update the assumptions underlying the
estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporate our historical
experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our
outstanding liability.

Our insurance
products provide fixed-benefit amounts that are not subject to medical-cost
inflation. Furthermore, our business is widely dispersed in both the United
States and Japan. This geographic dispersion and the nature of our benefit
structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims
payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. Claims incurred
under Aflac’s policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short
time frame. The unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions,
in particular, severity and frequency of claims. Severity is the ultimate size
of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. Our claims
experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders.

During the
fourth quarter of 2006, we increased Aflac’s U.S. unpaid policy claims
liability by $28 million. As part of our analysis of recent cancer claims
experience, we noted that the overall duration of cancer outpatient treatments
has lengthened. Since our reserving methods are designed to fully accrue each
cancer outpatient treatment as of the date of initial treatment, we increased
our estimate of the Aflac U.S. unpaid policy claims liability by $28 million. This
change in estimate is reflected in current year’s earnings. If we had been
using the new claims factors to produce our claim liability estimates at the
end of 2005, the increase for 2006 would have been $9 million. We expect that
the annual impact on future earnings will be approximately $9 million.

In addition,
during the fourth quarter we transferred $170 million of the Aflac U.S. unpaid
policy claims liability to future policy benefits. This transfer was primarily
related to new product lines where early policy duration claims have been lower
than we anticipated. However, our analysis indicates that it is appropriate to
hold this liability in future policy benefits. This transfer had no impact on
net earnings.

Also during
the fourth quarter of 2006, we transferred $85 million from Aflac Japan’s
unpaid policy claims liability to its future policy benefits liability. This
transfer, which was primarily related to a continued decline in current period
claims caused by changes to health care delivery in Japan, had no effect on net
earnings. Our 2006 claims review indicated that we experienced a continued
decline in the average number of hospital days associated with the typical
cancer treatment period in Japan. We believe the average number of days
declined primarily due to changes in financial incentives provided to hospitals
by the government-sponsored health care system in Japan to shorten the average
hospital stay. However, our claims statistics also indicated that the declines
in the average number of days per hospitalization are generally offset by an
increase in the frequency of

II-



hospitalizations
associated with the treatment of cancer. This shift reduced current period
claims, and future period claims are anticipated to increase by similar amounts.

In
computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, we consider many factors,
including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and
demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business
practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative
practices. We monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the
liability as actual experience emerges. Claim levels are generally stable from
period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. In
calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, we do not calculate a range of
estimates. The following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid
policy claims liability as of December 31, 2006, to changes in severity
and frequency of claims. For the years 2004 through 2006, and before the effect
of the fourth quarter 2006 adjustments noted above, our assumptions changed on
average by approximately 1% in total, and we believe that a variation in
assumptions in a range of plus or minus 1% in total is reasonably likely to
occur.

Realized Investment Gains and Losses

Our investment
strategy is to invest in fixed-income securities to provide a reliable stream
of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the Company’s
profitability. We do not purchase securities with the intent of generating
capital gains or losses. However, investment gains and losses may be realized
as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of
specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and/or general portfolio maintenance
and rebalancing. The realization of investment gains and losses is independent
of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which are the
principal drivers of our profitability.

In 2006, we
realized pretax gains of $79 million (after-tax, $51 million, or $.10 per
diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps and the liquidation of
equity securities held by Aflac U.S. In 2005, we realized pretax gains of $262
million (after-tax, $167 million, or $.33 per diluted share) primarily as a
result of bond swaps. We began our bond-swap program in the second half of 2005
and concluded it in the first half of 2006. These bond swaps took advantage of
tax loss carryforwards and also resulted in an improvement in overall portfolio
credit quality and investment income.

During
2004, we received an issuer’s offer to redeem certain available-for-sale
yen-denominated debt securities held by the Company. We accepted the issuer’s
offer of $205 million and recorded a pretax loss of $23 million. This
investment loss and other investment gains and losses in the normal course of
business decreased 2004 pretax earnings by $12 million (after-tax, $5 million,
or $.01 per diluted share).

Impact from SFAS 133

We entered
into cross-currency swap agreements to effectively convert our
dollar-denominated senior notes, which mature in 2009, into a yen-denominated
obligation (see Notes 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements). The effect of issuing fixed-rate, dollar-denominated debt and
swapping it into fixed-rate, yen-denominated debt has the same economic impact
on Aflac

II-



as
if we had issued yen-denominated debt of a like amount. However, the accounting
treatment for cross-currency swaps is different from issuing yen-denominated
Samurai and Uridashi notes. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133), requires that the
change in the fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency
swaps, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, be reflected in net
earnings (other income). This change in fair value is determined by relative
dollar and yen interest rates and has no cash impact on our results of
operations. At maturity, the fair value will equal initial contract fair value,
and the cumulative impact of gains and losses from the changes in fair value of
the interest component will be zero. We have the ability and intent to retain
the cross-currency swaps until their maturity. The impact from SFAS 133
includes the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the
cross-currency swaps, which does not qualify for hedge accounting.

We have also
issued yen-denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes. We have designated these
notes as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. If the value of these
yen-denominated notes and the notional amounts of the cross-currency swaps
exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, we would be required to recognize the
foreign currency effect on the excess, or ineffective portion, in net earnings
(other income). The ineffective portion would be included in the impact from
SFAS 133. These hedges were effective during the three-year period ended
December 31, 2006; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings.

During the
third quarter of 2006, we entered into interest rate swap agreements related to
the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes (see Notes 4 and
7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). By entering into
these contracts, we have been able to lock in the interest rate at 1.52% in yen.
We have designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in
our interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi
notes. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount
and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no
value at inception. SFAS 133 requires that the change in the fair value of the
swap contracts be recorded in other comprehensive income so long as the hedge
is deemed effective. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in net earnings (other
income). The impact from SFAS 133 would include any ineffectiveness associated
with these interest rate swaps. The fair value of these swaps and related
changes in fair value were immaterial during the year ended December 31,
2006. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.

Nonrecurring Items

We received
regulatory approval for a change in the allocation of expenses under the
management fee agreement between Aflac and the Parent Company in 2005. This
enabled the Parent Company to fully utilize its tax-basis, non-life operating
losses and therefore release the valuation allowance on the associated deferred
tax assets, resulting in a benefit of $34 million ($.07 per diluted share)
in 2005.

The American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 eliminated the 90% limitation on the utilization of
foreign tax credits. As a result of this tax law change, we recognized a
benefit of $128 million ($.25 per diluted share) in 2004 for the release of the
valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax

II-



assets.
The 2005 and 2004 tax benefits are included as reductions to income tax expense
in the consolidated statements of earnings.

During
2004, we concluded the process of returning the substitutional portion of Aflac
Japan’s pension plan to the Japanese government as allowed by the Japan Pension
Insurance Law. We recognized a one-time gain (other income) as the result of
this transfer to the Japanese government in the amount of $6 million
(after-tax, $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share) in 2004.

Foreign Currency Translation

Aflac Japan’s
premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and
expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase yen-denominated assets to
support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen-denominated
financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting
purposes. We translate Aflac Japan’s yen-denominated income statement into
dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we
translate its yen-denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end
of the period. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and
converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do
not actually convert yen into dollars.

Due
to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen,
fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on
our reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into
dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens,
translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently,
yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to
the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current
year results in relation to the prior year. As a result, we view foreign
currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not an
economic event to our Company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange
rates distort the growth rates of our operations, management evaluates Aflac’s
financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.

Income Taxes

Our
combined U.S. and Japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was
34.5% in 2006, 33.4% in 2005, and 28.6% in 2004. Total income taxes were $781
million in 2006, compared with $743 million in 2005 and $507 million in 2004. Japanese
income taxes on Aflac Japan’s results account for most of our consolidated
income tax expense. Our 2005 income tax rate was lower than normal primarily as
a result of the release of the valuation allowance for non-life losses
discussed previously. Our 2004 income tax rate and tax expense were also lower
than normal as a result of the release of the valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets discussed previously. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

II-



Earnings Guidance

We communicate earnings guidance in this
report based on the growth in net earnings per diluted share. However, certain
items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of management’s control may
have a significant impact on actual results. Therefore, our comparison of net
earnings includes certain assumptions to reflect the limitations that are
inherent in projections of net earnings. In comparing year-over-year results,
we exclude the effect of realized investment gains and losses, the impact from
SFAS 133 and nonrecurring items. We also assume no impact from foreign currency
translation on the Aflac Japan segment and the Parent Company’s yen-denominated
interest expense for a given year in relation to the prior year.

Subject to the
preceding assumptions, our objective for 2006 was to achieve net earnings per
diluted share of at least $2.92, an increase of 15.0% over 2005 using the
preceding assumptions. We reported 2006 net earnings per diluted share of $2.95.
Adjusting that number for realized investment gains ($.10 per diluted
share), the impact from SFAS 133 (nil per diluted share) and foreign currency
translation (a loss of $.08 per diluted share), we exceeded our objective for
the year.

Our
objective for 2007 is to increase net earnings per diluted share by 15% to 16%
over 2006, on the basis described above.

If
we achieve this objective, the following table shows the likely results for
2007 net earnings per diluted share, including the impact of foreign currency
translation using various yen/dollar exchange rate scenarios.

INSURANCE OPERATIONS

Aflac’s
insurance business consists of two segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. Aflac
Japan, which operates as a branch of Aflac, is the principal contributor to
consolidated earnings. GAAP financial reporting requires that a company report
financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual
financial statements. Furthermore, we are required to report a measure of
segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets.

We
measure and evaluate our insurance segments’ financial performance using
operating earnings on a pretax basis. We define segment operating earnings

as the profits we derive
from our

II-



operations before realized investment gains
and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. We believe that
an analysis of segment pretax operating earnings is vitally important to an
understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our
insurance business. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business
is conducted in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the
impact of translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars.

We
evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium sales, an industry
operating measure. Total new annualized premium sales, which include new sales
and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions, represent the
premiums that we would collect over a 12-month period, assuming the
policies remain in force. Premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial
performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been
earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period.

The percentage
increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force. The
increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of 5.4% in 2006 and 6.8% in
both 2005 and 2004, reflect the high persistency of Aflac Japan’s business and
the sales of new policies. Annualized premiums in force at December 31,
2006, were 1.08 trillion yen, compared with 1.03 trillion yen in 2005 and 961.9
billion yen in 2004. Annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at
respective year-end exchange rates, were $9.1 billion in 2006, $8.7 billion in
2005 and $9.2 billion in 2004.

Aflac Japan
maintains a portfolio of dollar-denominated and reverse-dual currency
securities (yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). Dollar-denominated
investment income from these assets accounted for approximately 37% of Aflac
Japan’s investment income in 2006,

II-



compared
with 32% in 2005 and 30% in 2004. In years when the yen strengthens in relation
to the dollar, translating Aflac Japan’s dollar-denominated investment income
into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total operating
revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. In years when the yen
weakens, translating dollar-denominated investment income into yen magnifies
growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax
operating earnings in yen terms. On a constant currency basis,
dollar-denominated investment income accounted for approximately 36% of Aflac
Japan’s investment income during 2006, compared with 32% in both 2005 and 2004.

The following table illustrates the effect
of translating Aflac Japan’s dollar-denominated investment income and related
items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have

The benefit
ratio has declined over the past several years, reflecting the impact of newer
products with lower loss ratios. We have also experienced favorable claim
trends in our major product lines. We expect the benefit ratio to continue to
decline in future years primarily reflecting the shift to newer products and
riders. However, this decline is partially offset by the effect of low
investment yields, which impacts our profit margin by reducing the spread
between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves (see table
and discussion on

Page II-27

).
The operating expense ratio was higher in 2005 as a result of additional
advertising expenditures and the write-off of previously capitalized systems
development costs. We expect the operating expense ratio to be relatively
stable

II-



in
2007. Due to improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit
margin expanded to 15.8% in 2006. We expect continued expansion in the profit
margin in 2007.

Aflac Japan Sales

Aflac Japan’s
total new annualized premium sales declined 8.8% in 2006. The sales decline
primarily reflected industry-wide weakness in the market for stand-alone
medical insurance as well as continued declines in the sale of Rider MAX. The

We believe the
2006 sales decline for our medical product category primarily reflected consumers’
concern over the claims-paying issues facing the industry in general. We expect
this weakness will continue into 2007. However, with continued cost pressure on
Japan’s health care system, we expect demand for medical products will continue
to rise in the future and we remain encouraged about the outlook for the
medical insurance market. Although that market is very competitive, Aflac Japan
retains the distinction of being the number one seller of stand-alone medical
insurance in Japan. We believe that our number one position benefits us in the
marketplace. As a result, we continue to believe that the medical category will
be an important part of our product portfolio.

The ordinary
life category increased 16.9% in 2006, benefiting from the sale of WAYS, the
innovative life insurance product we introduced in January 2006. Unlike
traditional life insurance, WAYS allows a policyholder to convert a portion of
the life insurance coverage to medical, nursing care, or fixed annuity benefits
at retirement age. We remain very pleased with the initial response to WAYS,
which accounted for approximately 8% of new sales in 2006.

In June 2006,
we began selling a new cancer plan aimed at existing cancer insurance
policyholders. This new product provides additional benefits for inpatient and
outpatient care. Our

II-



cancer
life policies are also marketed by Dai-ichi Mutual Life and in June 2006,
Dai-ichi Life began selling a new cancer product customized for their market. As
a result, new sales from cancer insurance products were stable in 2006. We are
convinced that the affordable cancer products Aflac Japan provides will
continue to be an important part of our product portfolio.

We continue to
expect 2007 to be a challenging year from a sales perspective and look for
sales to again decline in the first half of the year, followed by modest sales
increases in the second half of 2007.

Aflac Japan Investments

Growth of
investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations,
timing of and yields on new investments, and the effect of yen/dollar exchange
rates on dollar-denominated investment income. Aflac Japan has invested in
privately issued securities to secure higher yields than Japanese government or
other public corporate bonds would have provided, while still adhering to
prudent standards for credit quality. All of our privately issued securities
are rated investment grade at the time of purchase. These securities are
generally issued with standard documentation for medium-term note programs and
have appropriate covenants.

for additional information.

Japanese Economy

Recent events
indicate that Japan’s economy has begun to recover. The Bank of Japan’s January 2007
Monthly Report of Recent Economic & Financial Developments stated that
Japan’s economy is expanding moderately, noting increases in exports and
capital expenditures and moderate increases in household income, private
consumption and housing investment, all against the backdrop of high corporate
profits and expansion of overseas economies. The report did note a downward
trend related to public investment and projected the trend to continue. However,
it also included an expectation that the economy would continue to expand
moderately, supported by expectations of increasing exports and domestic
private demand. Nevertheless, the time required for a full economic recovery
remains uncertain.

II-



Japan’s system
of compulsory public health care insurance provides medical coverage to every
Japanese citizen. These public medical expenditures are covered by a
combination of premiums paid by insureds and their employers, taxes, and
copayments from the people who receive medical service. However, given Japan’s
aging population, the resources available to these publicly funded social
insurance programs have come under increasing pressure. As a result, copayments
and other out-of-pocket expenses have been rising and affecting more people. In
2003, copayments were raised from 20% to 30% for most consumers and other
reforms were implemented in 2006. Additional reforms are being considered. We
believe higher out-of-pocket expenses will lead more consumers to purchase
supplemental insurance plans. Many insurance companies have recognized the
opportunities for selling supplemental medical insurance in Japan and have
launched new products in recent years. However, we believe our favorable cost
structure compared with other insurers makes us a very effective competitor. In
addition, we believe our brand, customer service, and financial strength also
benefit our market position.

Japanese Regulatory Environment

The FSA
adopted new mortality tables effective April 1, 2007, that will be used
when developing our policy premium and reserving assumptions on newly
underwritten policies. These new tables reflect recent improvements in survival
rates in Japan. If our other assumptions remain unchanged, these revisions will
generally lead to a decrease in policy premiums for death benefit products and
an increase in premium rates for third sector products and annuities.

Additionally,
the FSA has implemented a new rule for third sector product reserving. The
new reserving rule will be implemented in the Japanese fiscal year
starting April 1, 2007. Under the new rule, we are required to conduct
stress testing of our reserves using a prescribed method that incorporates
actual incidence rates. The results of the tests and their relation to our
reserves determine whether reserve strengthening is required. We do not
anticipate that the new reserving requirements will have a material impact on
our FSA-based financial statements or our pricing.

As disclosed
in our third quarter 2006 Form 10-Q, Aflac Japan, along with the
entire life insurance industry, began a review of the last five years of paid
claims to determine if those claims were paid fully and accurately. In a recent
notification from the FSA, the review process has been changed from a voluntary
program to one that is mandatory and has been expanded to include a review of
cash surrender value payments. Additionally, the FSA established a reporting
deadline of April 13, 2007. We expect to complete our review of claims and cash
surrender value payments and report our findings to the FSA within the time
frame specified. As a result of this review, we have found some payment errors
and we are correcting them. Additionally, we are using this review to identify
process changes that will help ensure that payment errors such as these are not
repeated. Although immaterial to our financial statements, we have recorded a
liability for our estimate of the underpaid portion of those claims in our 2006
financial statements.

The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of
premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force of 10.5% in
2006, 10.0% in 2005, and 10.9% in 2004 were favorably affected by increased
sales at the worksite primarily through cafeteria plans and a slight
improvement in the persistency of several products. Annualized premiums in
force at December 31 were $4.1 billion in 2006, compared with $3.7 billion
in 2005 and $3.4 billion in 2004.

After several years of trending upward, the benefit ratio declined
modestly in 2006. As a percentage of premium income, the benefit ratio was
61.0% in 2006, 61.3% in 2005, and 61.4% in 2004. We expect the benefit ratio to
decline slightly in future periods due to favorable claim cost trends. The 2006
operating expense ratio reflects the write-off of remaining deferred policy
acquisition costs associated with a large payroll account that terminated in
the first quarter. We expect the operating expense ratio, excluding
discretionary promotional expenses, to remain relatively stable in future
periods. The pretax operating profit margin is expected to increase slightly in
2007.

Aflac U.S. Sales

For 2006, total new annualized premium sales increased 13.1%, which
exceeded our objective of 8% to 12% growth for the year. These record sales
results were due, in part, to the re-enrollment of a large payroll account. Our
accident/disability and cancer expense products were again the primary
contributors to sales. The following table presents Aflac’s U.S. total new
annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31.

One aspect of our growth strategy is the continued enhancement of our
product line. During the third quarter of 2006, we launched revised specified
health event and intensive care plans. In 2007 we will introduce an innovative
care policy that provides benefits to help offset costs associated with caring
for dependents as a result of their accident or illness.

Another aspect of our growth strategy is our focus on growing and
improving our U.S. sales force, and we were encouraged to see continued
expansion in 2006. Although we did not set a specific recruiting target for
2006, we continued to emphasize recruiting as a means for growing our producer
base. We recruited more than 26,000 new associates during 2006, which was 7.8%
higher than 2005. At December 31, 2006, Aflac U.S. was represented by more
than 68,300 licensed sales associates, which was 8.5% higher than a year ago. Our
primary focus has been on increasing producing sales associates. We believe
that we can achieve better producer growth through more effective and
standardized training for our sales associates and sales management. On an
average weekly basis, the number of producing associates rose 6.4% in 2006 to
approximately 10,300, compared with a year ago. As previously disclosed, our
focus has shifted from average monthly producers to average weekly producers as
both a reporting and management metric. This shift provides for a more active
management of our sales associates and allows our sales management to monitor
progress and needs on a real-time basis.

OTHER OPERATIONS

Corporate operating expenses
consist primarily of personnel compensation, benefits, and facilities expenses.
Corporate expenses, excluding investment income, were $57 million in 2006, $56
million in 2005, and $67 million in 2004. Investment income included in
reported corporate expenses was $16 million in 2006, $14 million in 2005,
and $5 million in 2004. Corporate expenses in 2004 were higher than normal
primarily as a result of increased expenses associated with our retirement
obligations.

II-



ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

Our
financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our
operations during the last two years. The yen/dollar exchange rate at the end
of each period is used to translate yen-denominated balance sheet items to U.S.
dollars for reporting purposes. The exchange rate at December 31, 2006,
was 119.11 yen to one dollar, or .9% weaker than the December 31, 2005,
exchange rate of 118.07. The weaker yen decreased reported investments and cash
by $357 million; total assets by $400 million; and total liabilities by $392
million, compared with the amounts that would have been reported for 2006 if
the exchange rate had remained unchanged from December 31, 2005.

Market Risks of Financial Instruments

Because we
invest in fixed-income securities, our financial instruments are exposed
primarily to two types of market risks: currency risk and interest rate risk.

Currency Risk

The functional currency of

Aflac Japan’s insurance operation is the Japanese yen. All of Aflac
Japan’s premiums, claims and commissions are received or paid in yen, as are
most of its investment income and other expenses. Furthermore, m

ost of Aflac Japan’s investments, cash and
liabilities are yen-denominated. When yen-denominated securities mature or are
sold, the proceeds are generally reinvested in yen-denominated securities. Aflac
Japan holds these yen-denominated assets to fund its yen-denominated policy
obligations. In addition, Aflac Incorporated has yen-denominated notes payable
and cross-currency swaps related to its dollar-denominated senior notes.

Although we
generally do not convert yen into dollars, we do translate financial statement
amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes. Therefore,
reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations. We report
unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income.

On a
consolidated basis, we attempt to minimize the exposure of shareholders’ equity
to foreign currency translation fluctuations. We accomplish this by investing a
portion of Aflac Japan’s investment portfolio in dollar-denominated securities,
by the Parent Company’s issuance of yen-denominated debt and by the use of
cross-currency swaps (see Hedging Activities on

Page II-35

for additional
information). As a result, the effect of currency fluctuations on our net
assets is mitigated. The dollar values of our yen-denominated net assets, which
are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations for financial
reporting purposes, are summarized as follows (translated at end-of-period
exchange rates) for the years ended December 31:

*Actual year-end exchange
rate

We are exposed to economic currency risk only
when yen funds are actually converted into dollars. This primarily occurs when
we repatriate funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., which is done annually. The
exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation will differ from the
exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. These
repatriations have not been greater than 80% of Aflac Japan’s prior year
earnings determined in accordance with standards established by the FSA. A
portion of the repatriation may be used to service Aflac Incorporated’s
yen-denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into dollars.

II-



Interest Rate Risk

Our primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes in
interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt securities. We use
modified duration analysis, which measures price percentage volatility, to
estimate the sensitivity of fair values to interest rate changes on debt
securities we own. For example, if the current duration of a debt security is
10, then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately 10% if
market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors
remain constant. Likewise, the fair value of the debt security will decrease by
approximately 10% if market interest rates increase by 100 basis points,
assuming all other factors remain constant.

The estimated effect of potential increases
in interest rates on the fair values of debt securities we own, notes payable,
cross-currency swaps and our obligation for the Japanese policyholder
protection fund as of December 31 follows:

Changes in the interest rate environment have contributed to the
unrealized gains on debt securities we own. However, we do not expect to
realize a majority of these unrealized gains because we have the intent and
ability to hold these securities to maturity. Likewise, should significant
amounts of unrealized losses occur because of increases in market yields, we
would not expect to realize these losses because we have the intent and ability
to hold such securities to maturity or recovery of value. For additional
information on unrealized losses on debt securities, see Note 3 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

*Represents yen-denominated
investments for Aflac Japan that support policy obligations and therefore
excludes Aflac Japan’s annuities, and dollar-denominated investments and
related investment income

In response to low interest rates in the
United States, we lowered our required interest assumption for newly issued
products to 5.5% in 2005. In Japan, we lowered our required interest assumption
for some newly issued products to 2.5% in 2005. However, the majority of Japan’s
newly issued products have a required interest assumption of 3.0%. We continue
to monitor the spread between our new money yield and the required interest
assumption for newly issued products in both the United States and Japan and
will re-evaluate those assumptions as necessary.

Over the next two years, we have
yen-denominated securities that will mature with yields in excess of Aflac
Japan’s current net investment yield of 3.88%. These securities total $1.1
billion at amortized cost and have an average yield of 5.80%. Currently, when
debt securities we own mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below
that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities
on policies issued in earlier years. As a result, securities that mature may
contribute to a decline in our overall portfolio yield. However, adding riders
to our older policies has helped offset the negative investment spread. And
despite negative investment spreads, adequate overall profit margins still
exist in Aflac Japan’s aggregate block of business because of profits that have
emerged from changes in mix of business and favorable experience from
mortality, morbidity, and expenses.

II-



Investments and Cash

Our investment philosophy is to maximize investment income while
emphasizing liquidity, safety and quality. Our investment objective, subject to
appropriate risk constraints, is to fund policyholder obligations and other
liabilities in a manner that enhances shareholders’ equity. We seek to achieve
this objective through a diversified portfolio of fixed-income investments that
reflects the characteristics of the liabilities it supports.

Aflac invests primarily within the debt securities
markets.

We have investments in both publicly issued
and privately issued securities. However, the status of issuance should not be
viewed as an indicator of liquidity or as a limitation on the determination of
fair value. The outstanding amount(s) of a particular issuance, as well as
the level of activity in a particular issuance and the state of the market,
including credit events and the interest rate environment, affect liquidity
regardless of type of issuance. We routinely assess the fair value of all of
our investments. This process includes evaluating quotations provided by
outside securities pricing sources and/or compiled using data provided by
external debt and equity market sources, as described more fully in Note 3 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table details
investment securities by type of issuance as of December 31.

Privately issued securities accounted for 68.8% of total debt
securities, at amortized cost, at December 31, 2006, compared with 66.6%
at December 31, 2005. Privately issued securities held by Aflac Japan at
amortized cost accounted for $31.3 billion, or 64.0%, of total debt securities
at December 31, 2006, and $27.9 billion, or 61.8%, of total debt securities
at December 31, 2005. Reverse-dual currency debt securities accounted for
$9.7 billion, or 28.9%, of total privately issued securities at December 31,
2006, compared with $8.9 billion, or 29.6%, of total privately issued
securities at December 31, 2005. Aflac Japan has invested in privately
issued securities to secure higher yields than those available from Japanese
government bonds. Aflac Japan’s investments in yen-denominated privately issued
securities consist primarily of non-Japanese issuers and have longer
maturities, thereby allowing us to improve our asset/liability matching and our
overall investment returns. Most of our privately issued securities are issued
under medium-term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate
with credit ratings, except when internal credit analysis indicates that
additional protective and/or event-risk covenants are required.

Our investment activities expose us to credit risk, which is a
consequence of extending credit and/or carrying investment positions. However,
we continue to adhere to prudent standards for credit quality. We accomplish
this by considering our product needs and overall corporate objectives, in
addition to credit risk. Our investment policy requires that all securities be
rated investment grade at the time of purchase. In evaluating the initial
rating, we look at the overall senior issuer rating, the explicit rating for
the actual issue or the rating for the security class, and, where applicable,
the appropriate designation from the Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). All of our securities
have ratings from either a nationally recognized statistical rating
organization or the SVO of the NAIC. In addition, we perform extensive internal
credit reviews to ensure that we are consistent in applying rating criteria for
all of our securities.

We use specific criteria to judge the credit
quality of both existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use
several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and

distributions by credit rating of our purchases of debt securities for the
years ended December 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows:

The overall credit quality of our portfolio remained high in part
because our investment policy prohibits us from purchasing
below-investment-grade securities. In the event of a credit rating downgrade to
below-investment-grade status, we do not automatically liquidate our position. However,
if the security is in the held-to-maturity portfolio, we immediately transfer
it to the available-for-sale portfolio so that the security’s fair value and
its unrealized gain/loss are reflected on the balance sheet.

Once we designate a security as below
investment grade, we intensify our monitoring of the issuer. We do not
automatically recognize an impairment if the security’s amortized cost exceeds
its fair value. Our investment management starts by reviewing its credit
analysis. Included in this process are an evaluation of the issuer, its current
credit posture and an assessment of the future prospects for the issuer. We
then obtain fair value information from at least three independent pricing
sources. Upon determining the fair value, we move our focus to an analysis of
whether or not the decline in fair value, if any, is other than temporary. For
securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value, investment
management then reviews the issue based on our impairment policy to determine
if the investment should be impaired and/or liquidated. The assessment of
whether a decline is other than

II-



temporary requires significant management judgment and is discussed
more fully in the Critical Accounting Estimates section on

Occasionally a debt security will be split rated. This occurs when one
rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating
agency rates the same security as below investment grade. Our policy is to
review each issue on a case-by-case basis to determine if a split-rated
security should be classified as investment grade or below investment grade.
Our review includes evaluating the issuer’s credit position as well as current
market pricing and other factors, such as the issuer’s or security’s inclusion
on a credit rating downgrade watch list. Split-rated securities as of

*Not rated

The fair value of our investments in debt securities can fluctuate as a
result of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and
credit issues. Declines in fair value noted above resulted from changes in
interest rates, yen/dollar exchange rates, and issuer credit status. However,
we believe that it would be inappropriate to recognize impairment charges
because we believe the changes in fair value are temporary. Based on our
evaluation and analysis of specific issuers in accordance with our impairment
policy, impairment charges recognized in each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2006 were immaterial.

The weaker yen at year-end decreased reported policy liabilities by $353
million. Policy liabilities of Aflac U.S. increased 12.5%. The increase in
total policy liabilities is the result of the growth and aging of our in-force
business.

Notes Payable

Notes payable totaled $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2006 and 2005.
The ratio of debt to total capitalization (debt plus shareholders’ equity,
excluding the unrealized gains and losses on investment securities) was 17.2%
as of December 31, 2006, compared with 18.8% a year ago. See Note 7 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Benefit Plans

Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan have various benefit plans. For additional
information on our U.S. and Japanese plans, see Note 12 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Policyholder Protection Fund

The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system
that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. In 2002, the
members of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC)
approved the Financial Services Agency’s proposal, which increased the industry’s
obligation to the policyholder protection fund. In 2005, legislation was
enacted extending the LIPPC framework, which included government fiscal
measures supporting the LIPPC through March 2009. These new measures do
not contemplate additional industry assessments through March 2009 absent
an event requiring LIPPC funds. The likelihood and timing of future
assessments, if any, cannot be determined at this time.

Hedging Activities

Aflac has limited hedging activities. Our primary exposure to be hedged
is our investment in Aflac Japan, which is affected by changes in the
yen/dollar exchange rate. To mitigate this exposure, we have taken the
following courses of action. First, Aflac Japan owns dollar-denominated
securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our
investment in Aflac Japan. Second, we have designated the Parent Company’s
yen-denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes payable and
cross-currency swaps) as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. If the total
of these

II-



yen-denominated liabilities is equal to or
less than our net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be
effective and the related exchange effect is reported in the unrealized foreign
currency component of other comprehensive income. Should these yen-denominated
liabilities exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, the portion of the hedge that
exceeds our investment in Aflac Japan would be deemed ineffective. As required
by SFAS No. 133, we would then recognize the foreign exchange effect on
the ineffective portion in net earnings (other income). We estimate that if the
ineffective portion was 10 billion yen, we would report a foreign exchange
gain/loss of approximately $1 million for every one yen weakening/strengthening
in the end-of-period yen/dollar exchange rate. At December 31, 2006, our
hedge was effective with yen-denominated assets exceeding yen-denominated
liabilities by 105.4 billion yen, compared with 92.3 billion yen at December 31,
2005.

During the third quarter of 2006, we entered into interest rate swap
agreements related to the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi
notes. By entering into these contracts, we have been able to lock in our
interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We have designated these interest rate swaps as
a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the
variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The notional amounts and terms of the
swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest rate
Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. Changes in the fair
value of the swap contracts are recorded in other comprehensive income. The
fair value of these swaps and related changes in fair value were immaterial
during the year ended December 31, 2006.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2006, we had no
material unconditional purchase obligations that were not recorded on the
balance sheet. Additionally, we had no material letters of credit, standby
letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the Parent Company
through dividends and management fees. Aflac declared dividends to the Parent
Company in the amount of $665 million in 2006, compared with $526 million in
2005 and $643 million in 2004. During 2006, Aflac paid $68 million to the
Parent Company for management fees, compared with $73 million in 2005 and
$33 million in 2004. The increase in management fees in 2005 resulted from
a change in the allocation of expenses under the management fee agreement
between Aflac and the Parent Company. The primary uses of cash by the Parent
Company are shareholder dividends and our share repurchase program. The Parent
Company’s sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and are not
expected to change materially in the future.

The Parent Company also accesses debt
security markets to provide additional sources of capital. Capital is primarily
used to fund business expansion and capital expenditures. In 2003, we filed a
Shelf Registration Statement (SRS) with Japanese regulatory authorities to
issue up to 100 billion yen of Samurai notes in Japan. In July 2005, we
issued 40 billion yen (approximately $360 million) of these securities with a
coupon of .71% and a five-year maturity. These securities are not available to
U.S. persons. The remaining 60 billion yen of the 2003 SRS expired in December 2005.
As a result,

II-



we filed a new SRS with Japanese
regulatory authorities in February 2006 to issue up to 100 billion
yen (approximately $840 million using the December 31, 2006, exchange
rate) of Samurai notes in Japan. If issued, these securities will not be
available to U.S. persons. We also filed an SRS in August 2006 with
Japanese regulatory authorities to issue up to 100 billion yen (approximately
$840 million using the December 31, 2006, period-end exchange rate) of
Uridashi notes in Japan. In September 2006, the Parent Company issued 45
billion yen of yen-denominated Uridashi notes from this SRS. If issued, the
remaining 55 billion yen of yen-denominated Uridashi notes will not be
available to U.S. persons. We believe outside sources for additional debt and
equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available.

For additional information, see Note 7 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The principal sources of cash for our
insurance operations are premiums and investment income. The primary uses of
cash by our insurance operations are policy claims, commissions, operating
expenses, income taxes and payments to the Parent Company for management fees
and dividends. Both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable.

When making an investment decision, our first
consideration is based on product needs. Our investment objectives provide for
liquidity through the purchase of investment-grade debt securities. These
objectives also take into account duration matching, and because of the
long-term nature of our business, we have adequate time to react to changing
cash flow needs.

As a result of policyholder
aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a
policy. Therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early
years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. We
expect our future cash flows from premiums and our investment portfolio to be
sufficient to meet our cash needs for benefits and expenses.

The following table presents the estimated
payments by period of our major contractual obligations as of December 31,
2006. We translated our yen-denominated obligations using the December 31,
2006, exchange rate. Actual future payments as reported in dollars will
fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate.

The distribution of payments for future
policy benefits is an estimate of all future benefit payments for policies in
force as of December 31, 2006. These projected values contain assumptions
for future policy persistency, mortality and morbidity. The distribution of
payments for unpaid policy claims includes assumptions as to the timing of
policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims.
Actual amounts and timing of both future policy benefits and unpaid policy
claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above. We
anticipate that the future policy benefit liability of $40.8 billion at December 31,
2006, along with future net premiums and investment income, will be sufficient
to fund future policy benefit payments.

Consolidated Cash Flows

We translate cash flows for Aflac Japan’s
yen-denominated items into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. In
years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars
to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes
more dollars to be reported. The following table summarizes consolidated cash
flows by activity for the years ended December 31.

Cash flows for Aflac U.S. and Other Operations included the January 2005
return of cash collateral from the security lending activities of Aflac U.S. at
the end of 2004 (approximately $2.6 billion).

Prudent portfolio management dictates that we
attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our
liabilities. Currently, when debt securities we own mature, the proceeds may be
reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit
liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, the long-term nature
of our business and our strong cash flows provide us with the ability to
minimize the effect of mismatched durations and/or yields identified by various
asset adequacy analyses. When market opportunities arise, we dispose of
selected debt securities that are available for sale to improve the duration
matching of our assets and liabilities and/or improve future investment yields.
As a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to
year. Dispositions before maturity were approximately 7% of the annual average
investment portfolio of debt securities available for sale during the year
ended December 31, 2006, compared with 11% in 2005 and 5% in 2004. The
increase of dispositions before maturity in 2006 and 2005 primarily resulted
from the bond swaps we executed from the third quarter of 2005 through the
second quarter of 2006.

Financing Activities

Consolidated cash used by financing activities was $434 million in
2006, $196 million in 2005 and $313 million in 2004. In September 2006, we
received $382 million in connection with the Parent Company’s issuance of
yen-denominated Uridashi notes. In June 2006, the Parent Company paid $355
million in connection with the maturity of the 2001 Samurai notes. In October 2005,
we paid $261 million in connection with the maturity of the 2000 Samurai
notes. In July 2005, the Parent Company received $360 million from its
issuance of yen-denominated Samurai notes. Cash provided by investment-type
contracts was $217 million in 2006, compared with $257 million in 2005 and $220
million in 2004.

Regulatory Restrictions

Aflac is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to its regulations. The
Nebraska insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on
payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the
Parent Company. The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend
distributions that exceed the greater of the net gain from operations, which
excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under
statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of
the previous year-end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance department must
approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group
of companies. These regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level
of management fees or dividends paid by Aflac to the Parent Company. A life
insurance company’s statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed
by the NAIC, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance company’s
state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from GAAP and
are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency.

The continued long-term growth of our business may require increases in
the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations. Aflac’s
insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various
sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity
contributions by the Parent Company from funds generated through debt or equity
offerings. The NAIC’s risk-based capital (RBC) formula is used by insurance
regulators to facilitate identification of inadequately capitalized insurance
companies. The RBC formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk
and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in
the insurer’s operations. Aflac’s RBC ratio remains high and reflects a very
strong capital and surplus position. Currently, the NAIC has ongoing regulatory
initiatives relating to revisions to the RBC

II-



formula as well as numerous initiatives
covering insurance products, investments, and other actuarial and accounting
matters. We believe that we will continue to maintain a strong RBC ratio and
statutory capital and surplus position in future periods.

In addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by U.S. insurance
regulators, Japan’s FSA may not allow profit repatriations or other transfers
from Aflac Japan if they would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial
strength for the protection of policyholders. The FSA maintains its own solvency
standard. Aflac Japan’s solvency margin ratio significantly exceeds regulatory
minimums.

Payments are made from Aflac Japan to the
Parent Company for management fees and to Aflac U.S. for allocated expenses and
profit repatriations.

During 2006, Aflac
Japan paid $25 million to the Parent Company for management fees, compared with
$28 million in 2005 and $24 million in 2004.

Expenses allocated to Aflac
Japan were $32 million in 2006, $30 million in 2005 and $26 million in 2004. During
2006, Aflac Japan repatriated profits of $442 million (50.0 billion yen) to
Aflac U.S., compared with $374 million (41.2 billion yen) in 2005 and $220
million (23.9 billion yen) in 2004. Profits repatriated in 2004 were lower
primarily as a result of realized investment losses recognized in 2003. For
additional information on regulatory restrictions on dividends, profit
repatriations and other transfers, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Rating Agencies

Aflac is rated AA by both Standard &
Poor’s and Fitch Ratings and Aa2 (Excellent) by Moody’s for financial strength. A.M.
Best assigned Aflac an A+ (Superior) rating for financial strength and
operating performance. Aflac Incorporated’s senior debt, Samurai notes, and
Uridashi notes are rated A by Standard & Poor’s, A+ by Fitch Ratings,
and A2 by Moody’s.

Other

In October 2006, the board of directors declared the first quarter
2007 cash dividend of $.185 per share. The dividend is payable on March 1,
2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 16,
2007. In 2004, the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 30
million shares of our common stock. In 2006, the board of directors authorized
the purchase of an additional 30 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31,
2006, approximately 37 million shares were available for purchase under our
share repurchase programs.

NOTES TO THE
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description
of Business:

Aflac Incorporated (the
Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (the Company) primarily sell supplemental
health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The Company’s
insurance business is marketed and administered through American Family Life
Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States
(Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflac’s policies
are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Our
insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the
two markets for our insurance business. Aflac Japan accounted for 72% of the
Company’s total revenues in 2006, 74% in 2005 and 75% in 2004, and 82% of total
assets at both December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Basis
of Presentation:

We prepare our financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP). These principles are established primarily by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB). The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires us to make estimates when recording transactions resulting
from business operations based on currently available information. The most
significant items on our balance sheet that involve a greater degree of
accounting estimates and actuarial determinations subject to changes in the
future are the valuation of investments, deferred policy acquisition costs, and
liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims. These
accounting estimates and actuarial determinations are sensitive to market
conditions, investment yields, mortality, morbidity, commission and other
acquisition expenses, and terminations by policyholders. As additional
information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded
estimates will be revised and reflected in operating results. Although some
variability is inherent in these estimates, we believe the amounts provided are
adequate.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company,
its majority-owned subsidiaries and those entities required to be consolidated
under applicable accounting standards. All material intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

Translation
of Foreign Currencies:

The functional
currency of Aflac Japan’s insurance operations is the Japanese yen. We
translate our yen-denominated financial statement accounts into U.S. dollars as
follows. Assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period exchange rates.
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are translated at the
exchange rate on the trade date of each transaction. Other revenues, expenses
and cash flows are translated using average exchange rates for the year. The
resulting currency translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income. We include in earnings the realized currency exchange
gains and losses resulting from transactions. Realized currency exchange gains
and losses were immaterial during the three-year period ended December 31,
2006.

Aflac
Japan maintains an investment portfolio of dollar-denominated securities on
behalf of Aflac U.S. The functional currency for these investments is the U.S.
dollar. The related investment income and realized/unrealized investment gains
and losses are also denominated in U.S. dollars.

II-



We
have designated the yen-denominated Uridashi and Samurai notes issued by the
Parent Company and the cross-currency swaps as a hedge of our investment in
Aflac Japan (see the section in this note titled, “Derivatives”). Outstanding
principal and related accrued interest on these items are translated into U.S.
dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Currency translation adjustments are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Insurance
Revenue and Expense Recognition:

The
supplemental health and life insurance policies we issue are classified as
long-duration contracts. The contract provisions generally cannot be changed or
canceled during the contract period; however, we may adjust premiums for
supplemental health policies issued in the United States within prescribed
guidelines and with the approval of state insurance regulatory authorities.

Insurance
premiums for health and life policies are recognized ratably as earned income
over the premium payment periods of the policies. When revenues are reported,
the related amounts of benefits and expenses are charged against such revenues,
so that profits are recognized in proportion to premium revenues during the
period the policies are expected to remain in force. This association is
accomplished by means of annual additions to the liability for future policy
benefits and the deferral and subsequent amortization of policy acquisition
costs.

The
calculation of deferred policy acquisition costs and the liability for future
policy benefits requires the use of estimates consistent with sound actuarial
valuation techniques. For new policy issues, we review our actuarial
assumptions and deferrable acquisition costs each year and revise them when
necessary to more closely reflect recent experience and studies of actual
acquisition costs. For policies in force, we evaluate deferred policy
acquisition costs by major product groupings to determine that they are
recoverable from future revenues. Any resulting adjustment is charged against
net earnings.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand, money market instruments and other debt
instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased.

Investments:

Our
debt securities include fixed-maturity securities and perpetual debentures,
which are classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. Securities
classified as held to maturity are securities that we have the ability and
intent to hold to maturity or redemption and are carried at amortized cost. All
other debt securities and our equity securities are classified as available for
sale and are carried at fair value. If the fair value is higher than the
amortized cost for debt securities, or the purchase cost for equity securities,
the excess is an unrealized gain, and if lower than cost, the difference is an
unrealized loss.

The
net unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, plus the
unamortized unrealized gains and losses on debt securities transferred to the
held-to-maturity portfolio, less related deferred income taxes, are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income.

Amortized
cost of debt securities is based on our purchase price adjusted for accrual of
discount, or amortization of premium. The amortized cost of debt securities we
purchase at a discount will equal the face or par value at maturity. Debt
securities that we purchase at a premium will have an amortized cost equal to
face or par value at maturity or the call date, if applicable. Interest is
reported as income when earned and is adjusted for amortization of any premium
or discount.

II-



Our
investments in qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) are accounted for as
fixed-maturity or perpetual securities. All of our investments in QSPEs are
held in our available-for-sale portfolio.

For
the collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) held in our fixed-maturity
securities portfolio, we recognize income using a constant effective yield,
which is based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of
the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is
recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments.
The net investment in CMO securities is adjusted to the amount that would have
existed had the new effective yield been applied at the time of acquisition. This
adjustment is reflected in net investment income.

We
use the specific identification method to determine the gain or loss from
securities transactions and report the realized gain or loss in the
consolidated statements of earnings.

Our
credit analysts and credit research personnel routinely monitor and evaluate
the difference between the amortized cost and fair value of our investments. Additionally,
credit analysis and/or credit rating issues related to specific investments may
trigger more intensive monitoring to determine if a decline in fair value is
other than temporary. For investments with a fair value below amortized cost,
the process includes evaluating the length of time and the extent to which
amortized cost exceeds fair value, the prospects and financial condition of the
issuer, and our evaluation for a potential recovery in fair value, among other
factors. This process is not exact and requires consideration of risks such as
credit risk, which to a certain extent can be controlled, and interest rate
risk, which cannot be controlled. Therefore, if an investment’s amortized cost
exceeds its fair value solely due to changes in interest rates, impairment may
not be appropriate. If, after monitoring and analyses, management believes that
a decline in fair value is other than temporary, we adjust the amortized cost
of the security and report a realized loss in the consolidated statements of
earnings.

We
lend fixed-maturity securities to financial institutions in short-term security
lending transactions. These securities continue to be carried as investment
assets on our balance sheet during the terms of the loans and are not reported
as sales. We receive cash or other securities as collateral for such loans. For
loans involving unrestricted cash collateral, the collateral is reported as an
asset with a corresponding liability for the return of the collateral. For
loans collateralized by securities, the collateral is not reported as an asset
or liability.

Deferred
Policy Acquisition Costs:

The costs of
acquiring new business are deferred and amortized with interest over the
premium payment periods in proportion to the ratio of annual premium income to
total anticipated premium income. Anticipated premium income is estimated by
using the same mortality, persistency and interest assumptions used in
computing liabilities for future policy benefits. In this manner, the related
acquisition expenses are matched with revenues. Deferred costs include the
excess of current-year commissions over ultimate renewal-year commissions and
certain direct and allocated policy issue, underwriting and marketing expenses.
All of these costs vary with and are primarily related to the production of new
business.

Policy
Liabilities:

Future policy benefits
represent claims that may occur in the future and are computed by a net level
premium method using estimated future investment yields, persistency and
recognized morbidity and mortality tables modified to reflect our experience,
including a provision for adverse deviation. These assumptions are generally
established at the time a policy is issued.

II-



Unpaid
policy claims are estimates computed on an undiscounted basis using statistical
analyses of historical claims experience adjusted for current trends and
changed conditions. The ultimate liability may vary significantly from such
estimates. We regularly adjust these estimates as new claims experience emerges
and reflect the changes in operating results in the year such adjustments are made.

Income
Taxes:

Income tax provisions are
generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes,
which differ from those amounts used in preparing our income tax returns. Deferred
income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial
reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on
enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which we
expect the temporary differences to reverse.

Derivatives:

We have limited activity with
derivative financial instruments. We do not use them for trading purposes, nor
do we engage in leveraged derivative transactions. At December 31, 2006,
our only outstanding derivative contracts were interest rate swaps related to
our 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes and cross-currency
swaps related to our $450 million senior notes (see Notes 4 and 7).

We
document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
well as our risk-management objectives for undertaking various hedge
transactions. This process includes linking derivatives that are designated as
hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. We also assess,
both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives and nonderivatives
used in hedging activities are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
values of the hedged items. The assessment of hedge effectiveness determines
the noncash accounting treatment of changes in fair value.

We
have designated our cross-currency swaps as a hedge of the foreign currency
exposure of our investment in Aflac Japan. We include the fair value of the
cross-currency swaps in either other assets or other liabilities on the balance
sheet. We report the changes in fair value of the foreign currency portion of
our cross-currency swaps in other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair
value of the interest rate component are reflected in other income in the
consolidated statements of earnings.

We
have designated our interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability of the
interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. We
include the fair value of the interest rate swaps in either other assets or
other liabilities on the balance sheet. We report the changes in fair value of
the interest rate swaps in other comprehensive income as long as they are
deemed effective. Should any portion of the swap be deemed ineffective, that
value would be reported in other income in the consolidated statements of
earnings.

Policyholder
Protection Fund and State Guaranty Association Assessments:

In Japan, the government has
required the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection fund.
We recognize a charge for our estimated share of the industry’s obligation once
it is determinable. We review the estimated liability for policyholder
protection fund contributions on an annual basis and report any adjustments in
Aflac Japan’s expenses.

II-



In
the United States, each state has a guaranty association that supports insolvent
insurers operating in those states. To date, our state guaranty association
assessments have not been material.

Treasury
Stock:

Treasury stock is reflected as a
reduction of shareholders’ equity at cost. We use the weighted-average purchase
cost to determine the cost of treasury stock that is reissued. We include any
gains and losses in additional paid-in capital when treasury stock is reissued.

Earnings
Per Share:

We
compute basic earnings per share (EPS) by dividing net earnings by the
weighted-average number of unrestricted shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of
shares outstanding for the period plus the shares representing the dilutive
effect of share-based awards.

New
Accounting Pronouncements:

In September 2006,
the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158,
Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS
158). The provisions of SFAS 158 apply to all plan sponsors who offer defined
benefit postretirement plans. SFAS 158 requires a plan sponsor to recognize the
plan’s funded status as an asset or liability in its balance sheet, and to
measure plan assets and liabilities as of the end of the sponsor’s fiscal year.
It also requires an entity to recognize changes in the funded status of a
defined benefit postretirement plan in comprehensive income in the year in
which the changes occur. However, SFAS 158 does not change the amount of net
periodic benefit cost, or expense, included in net earnings. The recognition
and disclosure requirements of SFAS 158 are effective as of the end of the
fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. The measurement date
provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Earlier
application of the measurement date provisions is encouraged. We adopted the
recognition and measurement date provisions of this standard effective December 31,
2006. The adoption of this standard increased our pension plans’ projected
benefit obligation by $64 million; and resulted in a charge to other comprehensive
income of $64 million before taxes to reflect the increase in pension
liabilities and an opening adjustment to retained earnings in the amount of $2
million.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements
(SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value under GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This
standard applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair
value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting
pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly,
SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. Where applicable,
this standard simplifies and codifies related guidance within GAAP. SFAS 157 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with earlier
application encouraged under limited circumstances. We do not expect the
adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position
or results of operations.

In
June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48),
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109. The provisions of FIN 48 clarify the accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in

II-



accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax
position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two-step process. Under the first step,
the enterprise determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The second step is
measurement, whereby a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to
recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the
largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2006, with earlier application encouraged. We do not
expect the adoption of this interpretation to have a material effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

In
February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and
140 (SFAS 155). The provisions of SFAS 155 are effective for all financial instruments
acquired or issued after the beginning of the first fiscal year after September 15,
2006. Earlier adoption is permitted. SFAS 155 amends the accounting for hybrid
financial instruments and eliminates the exclusion of beneficial interests in
securitized financial assets from the guidance under SFAS 133. It also
eliminates the prohibition on the type of derivative instruments that qualified
special purpose entities may hold under SFAS 140. Furthermore, SFAS 155
clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are
not embedded derivatives. In accordance with the standard’s early adoption
provisions, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 155 on January 1, 2006. The
adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our financial position or
results of operations.

In
November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position Number FAS 115-1, The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments (FSP 115-1). FSP 115-1 addresses the determination as
to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other
than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. It also includes
accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an
other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about
unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary
impairments. The guidance in FSP 115-1 amends SFAS No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and became
effective January 1, 2006. The adoption of this staff position did not
have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In
September 2005, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the AICPA
issued Statement of Position (SOP) 05-1, Accounting by Insurance
Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or
Exchanges of Insurance Contracts (SOP 05-1). SOP 05-1 provides
accounting guidance on internal replacements of insurance and investment
contracts other than those specifically described in SFAS No. 97,
Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration
Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments. SOP 05-1
is effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2006, with earlier adoption encouraged. Retrospective
application of this SOP to previously issued

II-



financial statements is not permitted. The
adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our
financial position or results of operations.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised), Share-Based
Payment (SFAS 123R). This standard amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation
guidance. SFAS 123R establishes the accounting for grants of share-based awards
in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It
also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange
for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity
instruments or transactions that may be settled by the issuance of those equity
instruments. SFAS 123R requires that companies use a fair value method to value
share-based awards and recognize the related compensation expense in net
earnings. The provisions of SFAS 123R, as amended by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, were effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal
year after June 15, 2005, although earlier application was encouraged. In
accordance with the standard’s early adoption provisions, we began accounting
for share-based awards using the modified-retrospective application method
effective January 1, 2005.

Recent
accounting pronouncements that were not discussed above are not applicable to
our business.

Securities
and Exchange Commission Guidance:

In September 2006,
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108
(SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of
misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors
must be considered in quantifying misstatements in current year financial
statements. Under the provisions of SAB 108, a reporting entity must quantify
and evaluate errors using a balance sheet approach and an income statement
approach. After considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors,
if either approach results in a misstatement that is material, a reporting
entity’s financial statements must be adjusted. SAB 108 applies to SEC
registrants and is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15,
2006. In the course of evaluating
balance sheet amounts in accordance with the provisions of SAB 108, we have
identified the following amounts that we have adjusted for as of January 1,
2006: a tax liability in the amount of $87 million related to deferred tax
asset valuation allowances that were not utilized; a tax liability in the
amount of $45 million related to various provisions for taxes that were
not utilized; and a litigation liability in the amount of $11 million related
to provisions for various pending law suits that were not utilized. These
liabilities were recorded in immaterial amounts prior to 2004 over a period
ranging from 10 to 15 years. However, using the dual evaluation approach
prescribed by SAB 108, correction of the above amounts would be material to
current year earnings. In accordance with the provisions of SAB 108, the
following amounts, net of tax where applicable, have been reflected as an
opening adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2006: a reduction
of tax liabilities in the amount of $132 million; a reduction of litigation
reserves in the amount of $11 million; and a reduction in deferred tax assets
in the amount of $4 million. These three adjustments resulted in a net
addition to retained earnings in the amount of $139 million.

BUSINESS SEGMENT AND FOREIGN INFORMATION

The Company
consists of two reportable insurance business segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac
U.S., both of which sell individual supplemental health and life insurance.

Operating
business segments that are not individually reportable are included in the
“Other business segments” category. We do not allocate corporate overhead
expenses to business segments. We evaluate and manage our business segments
using a financial performance measure called pretax operating earnings. Our
definition of operating earnings excludes the following items from net earnings
on an after-tax basis: realized investment gains/losses, the impact from SFAS
133, and nonrecurring items. We then exclude income taxes related to operations
to arrive at pretax operating earnings. Information regarding operations by
segment for the years ended December 31 follows:

portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. We have designated the Parent
Company’s yen-denominated notes payable and cross-currency swaps as a hedge of
our investment in Aflac Japan. The dollar values of our yen-denominated net
assets, which are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations for

Policyholder Protection Fund:

The
total liability accrued for our obligations to the Japanese life insurance
policyholder fund was $175 million (20.8 billion yen) at December 31,
2006, compared with $203 million (23.9 billion yen) a year ago. The obligation
is payable in semi-annual installments through 2013.

Property
and Equipment:

The costs of buildings,
furniture and equipment are depreciated principally on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives (maximum of 45 years for buildings and 10
years for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
are expensed as incurred; expenditures for betterments are capitalized and
depreciated. Classes of property and equipment as of December 31 were as

Privately
issued securities held by Aflac Japan at amortized cost accounted for $31.3
billion, or 64.0%, of total debt securities at December 31, 2006, compared
with $27.9 billion, or 61.8%, of total debt securities at December 31,
2005. Total privately issued securities, at amortized cost, accounted for $33.6
billion, or 68.8%, of our total debt securities as of December 31, 2006,
compared with $30.1 billion, or 66.6%, at December 31, 2005. Of the
total privately issued securities, reverse-dual currency debt securities
(principal payments in yen, interest payments in dollars) accounted for $9.7 billion,
or 28.9%, at amortized cost as of December 31, 2006, compared with $8.9
billion, or 29.6%, at amortized cost as of December 31, 2005.

At December 31,
2006, we owned below-investment-grade debt securities in the amount of $1.3 billion
at amortized cost ($1.1 billion at fair value), or 2.6% of total debt
securities, compared with $1.1 billion at amortized cost ($886 million at
fair value), or 2.3% of total debt securities a year ago. Each of the
below-investment-grade securities was investment grade at the time of purchase
and was subsequently downgraded by credit rating agencies. These securities are
held in the available-for-sale portfolio.

As of December 31,
2006, $91 million, at fair value, of Aflac Japan’s debt securities had been
pledged to Japan’s policyholder protection fund. At December 31, 2006,
debt securities with a fair value of $13 million were on deposit with
regulatory authorities in the United States and Japan. We retain ownership of
all securities on deposit and receive the related investment income.

In 2006, we
realized pretax gains of $79 million (after-tax, $51 million, or $.10 per
diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps and the liquidation of
equity securities held by Aflac U.S. In 2005, we realized pretax gains of $262
million (after-tax, $167 million, or $.33 per diluted share) primarily as a
result of bond swaps. We began our bond-swap program in the second half of 2005
and concluded it in the first half of 2006. These bond swaps took advantage of
tax loss carryforwards and also resulted in an improvement in overall portfolio
credit quality and investment income.

During 2004,
we received an issuer’s offer to redeem certain available-for-sale
yen-denominated debt securities held by the Company. We accepted the issuer’s
offer of $205 million and recorded a pretax loss of $23 million. This
investment loss and other investment gains and losses in the normal course of
business decreased pretax earnings by $12 million (after-tax $5 million, or
$.01 per diluted share).

Fair values of
debt securities and privately issued equity securities were determined using
quotations provided by outside securities pricing sources and/or compiled using
data provided by external debt and equity market sources. The data used in
estimating fair value include credit spreads of comparably credit-rated
securities and market quotations of securities with similar maturity and call
structure characteristics. Fair values are then computed using standard
industry models that provide pricing data based on a wide variety of inputs as
noted above. The fair values provided by outside sources are reviewed
internally for reasonableness. If a fair value appears unreasonable, the inputs
are re-examined and the value is confirmed or revised. The fair values for
publicly traded equity securities were determined using market quotations from
the public exchange markets where the securities are principally traded.

The unrealized
losses on our investments in government and guaranteed fixed-maturity
securities, which include U.S. Treasury obligations, direct obligations of U.S.
government agencies, Japan government bonds, and direct obligations of Japan
government agencies were caused by changes in interest rates and/or exchange
rates. The contractual cash flows of these investments are guaranteed by either
the U.S. or Japanese government. Furthermore, the contractual terms of these
investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less
than the amortized cost of the investment. Because we have the ability and
intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be
maturity, we do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily
impaired at December 31, 2006.

The unrealized
losses on the other investment categories in the preceding table were caused by
changes in interest rates, yen/dollar exchange rates, and/or increased credit
spreads. For credit related declines in market value, we begin a more focused
review of the related issuer including more significantly, issuer credit
ratings, issuer financial statements and other available financial data,
timeliness of payment and issuer competitive environment. From those reviews,
we evaluate the issuer's continued ability to service our investment. If, based
on our reviews, we determine that the issuer has the ability to continue to
service our investment; we conclude that the investment is temporarily
impaired. Because we have the ability and intent to hold these investments
until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, we do not consider these
investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2006.

Included in
the unrealized losses on Other corporate fixed-maturity securities is an
unrealized loss of $56 million on Aflac Japan’s $201 million (24 billion yen)
investment in Tollo Shipping Company S.A. Our investment is guaranteed by the
issuer’s parent, Compañia Sudamericana de Vapores S.A. (CSAV). The decline in
fair value of the security was primarily caused by two factors: depressed
revenue due to competitive pricing pressures in the container shipping industry
and weaker operating margins due to sharply increased fuel costs. The
contractual terms of this investment do not permit the issuer or its parent to
settle the security at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment,
and give priority to repayment of our investment under certain circumstances.
While CSAV’s credit rating has decreased from BBB- to BB+ (S&P), we
currently believe it is probable that we will collect all amounts due according
to the contractual terms of the investment. Therefore, it is expected that our
investment would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the
investment. Because we have the intent and ability to hold this investment until
a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, we do not consider it to be
other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2006.

attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our
liabilities. The following table presents the approximate duration of our
yen-denominated assets and liabilities, along with premiums, as of December 31.

(In years)



Yen-denominated
  debt securities



Policy
  benefits and related expenses to be paid in future years



Premiums to be received in future years on
  policies in force



Currently,
when our debt securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield
below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit
liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, our strategy of
developing and marketing riders to our older policies has helped offset the
negative investment spread. In spite of the negative investment spreads,
overall profit margins in Aflac Japan’s aggregate block of business are
adequate because of profits that continue to emerge from changes in mix of
business and favorable mortality, morbidity, and expenses.

The Parent
Company has a portfolio of investment-grade available-for-sale fixed-maturity
securities totaling $103 million at amortized cost and $102 million at fair
value, which is not included in the table above.

Expected
maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some issuers have the
right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment
penalties.

We own
subordinated perpetual debenture securities. These securities are subordinated
to other debt obligations of the issuer, but rank higher than equity securities.
Although these securities have no contractual maturity, the interest coupons
that were fixed at issuance subsequently change to a floating short-term
interest rate of 125 to 300 basis points above market rates, generally by the

th

year after issuance, thereby creating an
economic maturity date. The economic maturities of our investments in perpetual
debentures at December 31, 2006, were as follows:

As part of our
investment activities, we own investments in qualified special purpose entities
(QSPEs). At December 31, 2006, available-for-sale QSPEs totaled $2.3
billion at fair value ($2.3 billion at amortized cost, or 4.7% of total
debt securities), compared with $2.2 billion at fair value ($2.3 billion at
amortized cost, or 5.0% of total debt securities) at December 31, 2005. We
have no equity interests in any of the QSPEs, nor do we have control over these
entities. Therefore, our loss exposure is limited to the cost of our
investment.

We
also own yen-denominated investments in variable interest entities (VIEs)
totaling $1.9 billion at fair value, ($2.0 billion at amortized cost, or 4.2%
of total debt securities) at December 31, 2006. We are the primary
beneficiary of VIEs totaling $1.5 billion at fair value ($1.7 billion at
amortized cost)

II-



and have consolidated our interests in these
VIEs in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003),
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The activities of these VIEs are
limited to holding debt securities and utilizing the cash flows from the debt
securities to service our investments therein. The terms of the debt securities
mirror the terms of the notes held by Aflac. The consolidation of these
investments does not impact our financial position or results of operations. We
also have interests in VIEs that we are not required to consolidate totaling
$375 million at fair value ($373 million at amortized cost) as of December 31,
2006. The loss on any of our VIE investments would be limited to its cost.

We
lend fixed-maturity securities to financial institutions in short-term security
lending transactions. These short-term security lending arrangements increase
investment income with minimal risk. Our security lending policy requires that
the fair value of the securities and/or cash received as collateral be 102% or
more of the fair value of the loaned securities. At December 31, 2006, we
had security loans outstanding with a fair value of $780 million, and we held
cash in the amount of $807 million as collateral for these loaned securities. At
December 31, 2005, we had security loans outstanding with a fair value of
$605 million, and we held cash in the amount of $622 million as collateral for
these loaned securities.

During
2006, we reclassified an investment from held to maturity to available for sale
as a result of the issuer’s credit rating downgrade. At the date of transfer,
this debt security had an amortized cost of $118 million.

During
2005, we reclassified an investment from held to maturity to available for sale
as a result of the issuer’s credit rating downgrade. This debt security had an
amortized cost of $254 million at the date of transfer.

During
2004, we reclassified two debt securities from held to maturity to available
for sale. The first transfer resulted from the issuer’s credit rating downgrade.
At the time of transfer, the debt security had an amortized cost of $118
million. Included in accumulated other comprehensive income immediately prior
to the transfer was an unamortized gain of $24 million related to this security.
This gain represented the remaining unamortized portion of a $32 million gain
established in 2001, when we reclassified this investment from available for
sale to held to maturity. The second transfer resulted from the deterioration
in the issuer’s credit worthiness. At the time of transfer, this debt security
had an amortized cost of $291 million.

Cross-currency

Obligation
  to Japanese policyholder protection fund





The methods of
determining the fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities
are described in Note 3. The fair values of notes payable with fixed interest
rates were obtained from an independent financial information service. The fair
values of our cross-currency swaps are the expected amounts that we would
receive or pay to terminate the swaps, taking into account current interest
rates, foreign currency rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap
counterparties. The fair value of the Japanese policyholder protection fund is
our estimated share of the industry’s obligation calculated on a pro rata basis
by projecting our percentage of the industry’s premiums and reserves and
applying that percentage to the total industry obligation payable in future
years.

The carrying
amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accrued investment income,
accounts payable, cash collateral and payables for security transactions
approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. Consequently, such instruments are not included in the above table.
The preceding table also excludes liabilities for future policy benefits and
unpaid policy claims as these liabilities are not financial instruments as
defined by GAAP.

We have
outstanding cross-currency swap agreements related to the $450 million senior
notes (see Note 7). We have designated the foreign currency component of these
cross-currency swaps as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of our
investment in Aflac Japan. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match
the principal amount and terms of the senior notes.

We entered
into cross-currency swaps to minimize the impact of foreign currency
translation on shareholders’ equity and to reduce interest expense by
converting the dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes we
issued into yen-denominated obligations. By entering into these cross-currency
swaps, we have been able to reduce our interest rate from 6.5% in dollars to
1.67% in yen. See Note 1 for information on the accounting policy for cross-currency
swaps.

We have
entered into interest rate swap agreements related to the 20 billion yen
variable interest rate Uridashi notes (see Note 7). By entering into these
contracts, we have been able to lock in the interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We
have designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our
interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The
notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of
the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The swaps had no value at inception.
Changes in the fair value of the swap contracts are recorded in other comprehensive
income. The fair value of these swaps and related changes in fair value were
immaterial during the year ended December 31, 2006.

We are exposed
to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our
cross-currency and interest rate swaps. The counterparties to our swap
agreements are U.S. and Japanese financial institutions with the following

In August 2006, t

he Parent
Company filed a Shelf Registration Statement (SRS) with Japanese regulatory
authorities to issue up to 100 billion yen of yen-denominated Uridashi notes in
Japan. In September 2006, the Parent Company issued three tranches of
Uridashi notes totaling 45 billion yen. The first tranche totaled 15 billion
yen and has a five-year maturity. The second tranche totaled

II-



10 billion yen and has a 10-year
maturity. The third tranche totaled 20 billion yen and has a five-year maturity
and a variable interest coupon of six-month yen LIBOR plus a spread. We have
entered into interest rate swaps related to the 20 billion yen variable interest
rate notes (see Note 4). Each tranche of Uridashi notes pays interest
semiannually, may only be redeemed pri

or to
maturity upon the occurrence of a tax event as specified in the respective bond
agreement and is not available to U.S. persons.

If issued, the 55
billion yen of Uridashi notes remaining under the August 2006 SRS will not
be available to U.S. persons.

In
2001, 2002, and 2005, the Parent Company issued yen-denominated Samurai notes,
each with five-year maturities. Each series of Samurai notes pays interest
semiannually, may only be redeemed prior to maturity upon the occurrence of a
tax event as specified in the respective bond agreement and is not available to
U.S. persons. In June 2006, we paid in full the .87% Samurai notes issued
in 2001.

For
our yen-denominated loans, the principal amount as stated in dollar terms will
fluctuate from period to period due to changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate.
We have designated all of our yen-denominated notes payable as a hedge of the
foreign currency exposure of our investment in Aflac Japan. We have also
designated the interest rate swaps on our variable interest rate Uridashi notes
as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with these
notes.

The
SRS we filed with Japanese regulatory authorities in 2003 expired in December 2005.
As a result, the Parent Company filed a new SRS with Japanese regulatory
authorities in February 2006 to issue up to 100 billion yen of
yen-denominated Samurai notes in Japan. If issued, these securities will not be
available to U.S. persons.

In
1999, we issued $450 million of senior notes. These notes pay interest
semiannually and are redeemable at our option at any time with a redemption
price equal to the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a make-whole
premium. We have entered into cross-currency swaps related to these notes (see
Note 4).

A valuation
allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets
will not be realized. In prior years, we established valuation allowances
primarily for alternative minimum tax credit and noninsurance loss
carryforwards that exceeded projected future offsets. Under U.S. income tax
rules, only 35% of noninsurance losses can be offset against life insurance
taxable income each year.

We received
regulatory approval for a change in the allocation of expenses under the
management fee agreement between Aflac and the Parent Company in 2005. This
enabled the Parent Company to fully utilize its tax-basis, non-life operating
losses and therefore release the valuation allowance on the associated deferred
tax assets, resulting in a benefit of $34 million ($.07 per diluted share) in
2005.

The American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 eliminated the 90% limitation on the utilization of
foreign tax credits. As a result of this tax law change, we recognized a
benefit of $128 million ($.25 per diluted share) for the release of the
valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets.

II-80


During
2005, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets decreased by $34 million
primarily due to utilization of non-life losses. For current U.S. income tax
purposes, alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $80 million were
available at December 31, 2006.

Share Repurchase Program:

In
2004, the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 30 million
shares of our common stock. In 2006, the board of directors authorized the
purchase of an additional 30 million shares of our common stock. As of
December 31, 2006, approximately 37 million shares were available for
purchase under our share repurchase programs.

Voting Rights:

In
accordance with the Parent Company’s articles of incorporation, shares of
common stock are generally entitled to one vote per share until they have been
held by the same beneficial owner for a continuous period of 48 months, at
which time they become entitled to 10 votes per share.

10.

SHARE-BASED
TRANSACTIONS

The Company
has two long-term incentive compensation plans. The first is a stock option
plan, which allows grants for incentive stock options (ISOs) to employees and
non-qualifying stock options (NQSOs) to employees and non-employee directors. The
options have a term of 10 years and generally vest after three years. The
strike price of options granted under this plan is equal to the fair market
value of a share of our common stock at the date of grant. At December 31,
2006, approximately 26 thousand shares were available for future grants under
this plan.

The second
long-term incentive compensation plan allows awards to Company employees for
ISOs, NQSOs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation
rights. Non-employee directors are eligible for grants of NQSOs, restricted
stock, and stock appreciation rights. Generally, the awards vest based upon
time-based conditions or time-and-performance-based conditions. Performance-based
vesting conditions generally include the attainment of goals related to Company
financial performance. As of December 31, 2006, the only performance-based
awards issued and outstanding were restricted stock awards. As of December 31,
2006, approximately 24 million shares were available for future grants under
this plan.

Share-based
awards granted to U.S.-based grantees are settled upon exercise with authorized
but unissued Company stock, while those issued to Japan-based grantees are
settled upon exercise with treasury shares.

The following table presents the expense
recognized as a result of applying the provisions of SFAS 123R for the periods
ended December 31.

We estimate the fair value of each stock
option granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton multiple option approach. Expected
volatility is based on historical periods generally commensurate with the
estimated term of options. We use historical data to estimate option exercise
and termination patterns within the model. Separate groups of employees that
have similar historical exercise patterns are stratified and considered
separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted is
derived from the output of our option model and represents the weighted-average
period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. We base the
risk-free interest rate on the Treasury note rate with a term comparable to
that of the estimated term of options. The weighted-average fair value of
options at their grant date was $15.28 for 2006, compared with $13.40 in 2005
and $10.66 in 2004. The following table presents the assumptions used in
valuing options granted during the years ended December 31.

As of December 31,
2006, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding was $333
million, with a weighted-average remaining term of 5.4 years. The aggregate
intrinsic value of stock options exercisable at that same date was $317
million, with a weighted-average remaining term of 4.5 years. The total
intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the year ended December 31,
2006, was $62 million, compared with $114 million in 2005 and $57 million in
2004. We received cash from the exercise of stock options in the amount of $38
million in 2006, compared with $49 million in 2005 and $32 million in 2004. The
tax benefit realized as a result of stock option exercises was $19 million in
2006 and $37 million in 2005. Due to the effect of the valuation allowance in
2004, the tax benefit realized from stock option exercises was immaterial (see
Note 8).

which $7 million (305 thousand shares) was related to share-based awards with a
performance-based vesting condition. We expect to recognize these amounts over
a weighted-average period of approximately two years. There are no other
contractual terms covering restricted stock awards once vested.

STATUTORY
ACCOUNTING AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

Our insurance
subsidiary is required to report its results of operations and financial
position to state insurance regulatory authorities on the basis of statutory
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by such authorities.

As determined
on a U.S. statutory accounting basis, Aflac’s net income was $1.7 billion in
2006, $1.3 billion in 2005, and $1.2 billion in 2004. Capital and surplus was $4.2
billion at December 31, 2006, and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2005.

Net assets of
the insurance subsidiaries aggregated $9.3 billion at December 31, 2006,
on a GAAP basis, compared with $8.9 billion a year ago. Aflac Japan accounted
for $5.7 billion, or 62.0%, of these net assets, compared with $5.5 billion, or
61.4% at December 31, 2005.

Aflac Japan
must report its results of operations and financial position to the Japanese
Financial Services Agency (FSA) on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis as
prescribed by the FSA. Capital and surplus (unaudited) of Aflac Japan, based on
Japanese regulatory accounting practices, aggregated $2.6 billion at December 31,
2006, and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2005. Japanese regulatory
accounting practices differ in many respects from U.S. GAAP. Under Japanese
regulatory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are charged off
immediately; deferred income tax liabilities are recognized on a different
basis; policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are
different; the carrying value of securities transferred to held to maturity is
different; policyholder protection fund obligations are not accrued; and premium
income is recognized on a cash basis.

The
Parent Company depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow, primarily in the form
of dividends and management fees. Consolidated retained earnings in the
accompanying financial statements largely represent the undistributed earnings
of our insurance subsidiary. Amounts available for dividends, management fees
and other payments to the Parent Company by its insurance subsidiary may
fluctuate due to different accounting methods required by regulatory
authorities. These payments are also subject to various regulatory restrictions
and approvals related to safeguarding the interests of insurance policyholders.
Our insurance subsidiary must maintain adequate risk-based capital for U.S.
regulatory authorities and our Japan branch must maintain adequate solvency
margins for Japanese regulatory authorities. Additionally, the maximum amount
of dividends that can be paid to the Parent Company by Aflac without prior
approval of Nebraska’s director of insurance is the greater of the net gain
from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous
year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory
capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. Dividends declared by Aflac
during 2007 in excess of $1.6 billion would require such approval. Dividends
declared by Aflac during 2006 were $665 million.

II-



A portion of Aflac Japan earnings, as determined on a Japanese
regulatory accounting basis, can be repatriated each year to Aflac U.S. after
complying with solvency margin provisions and satisfying various conditions
imposed by Japanese regulatory authorities for protecting policyholders. Profit
repatriations to the United States can fluctuate due to changes in the amounts
of Japanese regulatory earnings. Among other items, factors affecting
regulatory earnings include Japanese regulatory accounting practices and
fluctuations in currency translation of Aflac Japan’s dollar-denominated
investments and related investment income into yen. Profits repatriated by
Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S. were as follows for the years ended December 31:

The

strong solvency margin.

12.

BENEFIT PLANS

Our
basic employee defined-benefit pension plans cover substantially all of our
full-time employees in the United States and Japan. At December 31, 2006,
other liabilities included a liability for both plans in the amount of $102
million, compared with $65 million a year ago. The increase in the pension
liability is due principally to the adoption of SFAS 158. We plan to make
contributions of $20 million to the U.S. plan and $13 million to the Japanese
plan in 2007 to continue to improve their funded status.

On
December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions
and early adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158. SFAS 158
requires the recognition of the funded status (i.e., the difference between the
fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our benefit
plans in our financial statements, with a corresponding adjustment to
accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The adjustment to
accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption represents the net
unrecognized actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs or credits, as
applicable, and the unrecognized transition asset remaining from the initial
adoption of SFAS 87, all of which were previously netted against the plan’s
funded status in the past under the provisions of SFAS 87. These amounts will
be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost over future periods
consistent with our historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts.
Further, the components of the benefit obligations that arise in subsequent periods
and are not recognized as net periodic pension cost in the same periods will be
recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. Those amounts will
also be subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost as
previously described. The adoption of SFAS 158 had no effect on our earnings
for the year ended December 31, 2006, or for any prior period presented,
and it will not affect our operating results in future periods.

The incremental effects of adopting the provisions of SFAS 158 on our
consolidated balance sheets, statements of shareholders’ equity and statements
of comprehensive income at

II-



December 31, 2006 are presented in the
following table. Had we not adopted SFAS 158 at December 31, 2006, we
would have recognized an additional minimum liability under the provisions of
SFAS 87. The effect of recognizing the additional minimum liability is included
in the table below in the column labeled “Prior to Application of SFAS 158.”

We recognized

of accumulated other comprehensive income of $4 million, net of tax related to
the adoption of the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 for our U.S.
pension plan. The Japanese pension plan previously used a measurement date of December 31.
The impact of adopting the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 for our
other post employment benefit plans was negligible.

An actuarial
gain of $1 million related to the Japanese plan arose during the year and was

million related to the U.S. plan arose during the year and was included in
accumulated other comprehensive income. During 2006, $2 million of actuarial
loss was amortized to expense for the Japanese plan, while $3 million was amortized
to expense for the U.S. plan.

No prior
service costs or credits arose during 2006 and the amounts of prior service
costs and credits amortized to expense were immaterial for the year ended December 31,
2006. Amortization of actuarial losses to expense in 2007 is estimated to be $2
million for the Japanese plan and $4 million for the U.S. plan, while the
amortization of prior service cost and credit is expected to be negligible.

Aflac Incorporated common stock at December 31, 2006, compared with $3

for U.S. plan assets are 55% to 60% equity securities,

II-



35%
to 40% fixed-income securities and 1% to 3% cash and cash equivalents. Target
asset allocations for Japanese plan assets are 34% equity securities and 66%
fixed-income securities. As discussed below, the investment strategy of our
pension plans is long-term in nature. Cash and cash equivalents exceeded the
target allocations for the U.S. plan in 2005 primarily as a result of third
quarter employer contributions of $20 million in 2005.

The investment
objective of our U.S. and Japanese plans is to preserve the purchasing power of
the plan’s assets and earn a reasonable inflation adjusted rate of return over
the long term. Furthermore, we seek to accomplish these objectives in a manner
that allows for the adequate funding of plan benefits and expenses. In order to
achieve these objectives, our goal is to maintain a conservative,
well-diversified and balanced portfolio of high-quality equity, fixed-income
and money market securities. As a part of our strategy, we have established
strict policies covering quality, type and concentration of investment
securities. For our U.S. plan, these policies prohibit investments in precious
metals, limited partnerships, venture capital, and direct investments in real
estate. We are also prohibited from trading on margin. For our Japanese plan,
these policies include limitations on investments in derivatives including
futures, options and swaps, and low-liquidity investments such as real estate,
venture capital investments, and privately issued securities.

We monitor the
U.S. plan’s performance over a three- to five-year period utilizing shorter
time frame performance measures to identify trends. We review investment
performance and compliance with stated investment policies and practices on a
quarterly basis. The specific investment objectives for the U.S. pension plan
are: to exceed a composite of asset class target returns, weighted according to
the plan’s target asset allocation; and to outperform the median fund from a
universe of similarly managed corporate pension funds. Both objectives are
measured over a rolling five-year period. We monitor the Japanese plan’s
performance and compliance with stated investment policies and practices on a
quarterly basis.

Expected future benefit payments for the U.S.
and Japanese plans are as follows:

2012 - 2016



Prior to 2004,
our Japanese pension plan had two distinct components: the corporate portion
and the substitutional portion. The corporate portion, which the Company still
maintains, is based on a plan established by Aflac Japan. The substitutional
portion was transferred back to the Japanese government in 2004. In connection
with the transfer, we recognized a pretax gain of $6 million (after-tax, $3
million, or $.01 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2004.

During 2005,
the Japanese plan was amended. As a result of this amendment, participant
salary and future salary increases are not factors in determining pension
benefit cost or the related pension benefit obligation and accumulated benefit
obligation.

We base the
long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets on the historical rates of return
over the last 15 years and the expectation of similar returns over the
long-term investment goals and objectives of U.S. plan assets. We base the
long-term rate of return on the Japanese plan assets on the historical rates of
return over the last 10 years.

In addition to
the benefit obligations for funded employee plans, we also maintain unfunded
supplemental retirement plans for certain officers and beneficiaries. Retirement
expense for these unfunded supplemental plans was $16 million in 2006, $20
million in 2005, and $32 million in 2004. The accrued retirement liability for
the unfunded supplemental retirement plans was $209 million at December 31,
2006, compared with $203 million a year ago. The assumptions used in the
valuation of these plans were the same as for the funded plans.

Stock Bonus Plan:

Aflac U.S. maintains a stock
bonus plan for eligible U.S. sales associates. Plan participants receive shares
of Aflac Incorporated common stock based on their new annualized premium sales
and their first-year persistency of substantially all new insurance policies.
The cost of this plan, which is included in deferred policy acquisition costs,
amounted to $40 million in 2006, $37 million in 2005, and $35 million in 2004.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

We have
entered into two outsourcing agreements with IBM. The first agreement provides
mainframe computer operations and support for Aflac Japan. It began in 2006 and
has a remaining term of nine years and an aggregate remaining cost of 26.0
billion yen ($218 million using the December 31, 2006, exchange rate). The
second agreement provides computer server operations and support for Aflac
Japan. It begins in 2007 and has a term of nine years and an aggregate cost of
31.8 billion yen ($267 million using the December 31, 2006, exchange
rate).

We have also
entered into an outsourcing agreement with Accenture to provide application
maintenance and development services for our Japanese operation. The agreement
has a term of seven years with an aggregate cost of 5.3 billion yen ($45
million using the December 31, 2006, exchange rate).

We lease
office space and equipment under various agreements that expire in various
years through 2021. Future minimum lease payments due under non-cancelable
operating leases at December 31, 2006, were as follows:

In 2005, we
announced a multiyear building project for additional office space in Columbus,
Georgia. The initial phase is to be completed in mid-2007 and is expected
to cost approximately $26 million. The next phase of the expansion is
anticipated to begin in mid-2007.

We are a
defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the normal course of business.
Senior legal and financial management review litigation on a quarterly and
annual basis. The final results of any litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty. Although some of this litigation is pending in states where large
punitive damages bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by
plaintiffs have been awarded in recent years, we believe the outcome of pending
litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
shareholders and board of directors of Aflac Incorporated:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Aflac Incorporated
and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity, cash flows,
and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aflac Incorporated
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Aflac Incorporated’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 27, 2007
expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and the
effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

As
discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,

as
of January 1, 2006. Additionally, as discussed in notes 1 and 12 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

The
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated
the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the
end of the period covered by this annual report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based
on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the Evaluation
Date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

(a)

Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control -
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under this
framework, management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an audit report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, as stated in
their report, which is included herein.

Attestation
Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
shareholders and board of directors of Aflac Incorporated:

We have
audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

,

that
Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control -
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of

II-96


Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Also, in our opinion, Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, based on

criteria
established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee

of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)

.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Aflac
Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity, cash flows,
and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31,

opinion on those consolidated financial statements, with an explanatory paragraph as the Company adopted the provisions

related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity, cash flows,
and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2006, which are included herein. In connection with our audits of the
aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also audited the related
financial statement schedules as listed in Item 15. These financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statement schedules
based on our audits.

In our
opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,

as
