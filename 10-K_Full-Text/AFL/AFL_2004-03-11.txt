PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

AFLAC Incorporated qualifies as an accelerated filer within the meaning of Exchange Act Rule 12b-2.  Our internet address is aflac.com.  We make available, free of charge on our Web site, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments thereto as soon as reasonably practicable after those forms have been electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

General Description

AFLAC Incorporated was incorporated in 1973 under the laws of the state of Georgia.  AFLAC Incorporated (the Parent Company) is a general business holding company and acts as a management company, overseeing the operations of its subsidiaries by providing management services and making capital available.  Its principal business is supplemental health and life insurance, which is marketed and administered primarily through its subsidiary, American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (AFLAC).  AFLAC operates in the United States (AFLAC U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (AFLAC Japan).

Most of our insurance policies are individually underwritten and marketed at worksites through independent agents, with premiums paid by the employee.  We believe AFLAC is the world's leading writer of individually issued policies marketed at worksites.  We continue to diversify our product offerings in both Japan and the United States.  AFLAC Japan sells cancer plans, care plans, general medical expense plans, medical/sickness riders to our cancer plan, a living benefit life plan, and an accident plan.  AFLAC U.S. sells cancer plans and various types of health insurance, including accident and disability, fixed-benefit dental, personal sickness and hospital indemnity, hospital intensive care, long-term care, and short-term disability plans.  We also offer several life insurance plans in Japan and the United States.

We are authorized to conduct insurance business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, several U.S. territories and foreign countries.  Our only significant foreign operation is AFLAC Japan, which accounted for 74% of the Company's total revenues in 2003, 75% in 2002 and 78% in 2001.  The percentage of total assets attributable to AFLAC Japan was 84% at both December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Results of Operations

The following table presents an analysis of net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, as well as items impacting those performance measures, for the years ended December 31:

Realized Investment Gains and Losses:

Our investment strategy is to invest in fixed-income securities in order to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the company's profitability.  We do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses.  However, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers of fixed-maturity securities.  The realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which are the principal drivers of our profitability.

Cross-Currency Swaps:

We entered into cross-currency swap agreements to effectively convert our dollar-denominated senior debt obligation, which matures in 2009, into a yen-denominated obligation.  The effect of issuing fixed-rate, dollar-denominated debt and swapping it into fixed-rate, yen-denominated debt has the same economic impact on AFLAC as if we had issued straight yen-denominated debt of a like amount.  The accounting treatment for cross-currency swaps is different from issuing yen-denominated (Samurai) notes.  SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, requires that the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swap be reflected in the income statement.  The change in fair value is determined by relative dollar and yen interest rates and has no cash impact on our results of operations.  Additionally, we have the ability to retain the cross-currency swaps until their maturity.  At maturity,
 the swaps' fair value and their initial contract fair value will be equal and the cumulative impact of gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the interest component will be zero.  The amounts are reported in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Nonrecurring Items:

In December 2002, the members of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation approved the Financial Services Agency's (FSA) proposal, which required the industry to contribute an additional 78 billion yen (approximately $728 million using the December 31, 2003 exchange rate) to Japan's policyholder protection fund.  Our estimated share of the assessment decreased 2002 pretax earnings by $40 million (after-tax, $26 million or $.05 per diluted share).  This charge is included in acquisition and operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

For information on our results of operations and financial information by segment, see Exhibit 13, pages 13-3 to 13-33 (Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)), pages 13-47 to 13-50 (Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and page 13-80 (Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which are incorporated herein by reference.

Foreign Currency Translation

AFLAC Japan's premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen.  Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase yen-denominated assets to support yen-denominated policy liabilities.  These and other yen-denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes.  We translate AFLAC Japan's income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate its balance sheet using an end-of-period exchange rate.  However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency.  Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars.

Due to the relative size of AFLAC Japan, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results.  In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported.  When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported.  Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period.  As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for AFLAC and not an economic event to our company or shareholders.  Because the effect of translating yen into dollars distorts the rate of growth of our operations, management evaluates AFLAC's financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.

The yen/dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2003 was 107.13, compared with 119.90 as of December 31, 2002.  Weighted-average yen/dollar exchange rates were 115.95 in 2003, 125.15 in 2002 and 121.54 in 2001.  We report currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income and the realized currency exchange gains and losses resulting from transactions in earnings.  In 2003, the effect of currency translation increased total assets by $4.2 billion, increased total liabilities by $4.2 billion and increased net earnings by $7 million.

For further information regarding the effect of currency fluctuations on our business, see Exhibit 13, page 13-8 (Foreign Currency Translation section of MD&A), Exhibit 13, pages 13-16 to 13-18 (Currency Risk section of MD&A), Exhibit 13, pages 13-27 to 13-28 (Notes Payable section of MD&A) and pages 13-47 to 13-50 (Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which are incorporated herein by reference.

Insurance Premiums

The growth of earned premiums is directly affected by the change in premiums in force and by the change in weighted-average yen/dollar exchange rates.  Consolidated earned premiums were $9.9 billion in 2003, $8.6 billion in 2002 and $8.1 billion in 2001. The following table sets forth the changes in annualized premiums in force for AFLAC's insurance business for the years ended December 31:

Insurance - Japan

AFLAC Japan earned premium income by major product categories is included in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Exhibit 13, page 13-48.  We translate annualized premiums in force into dollars at the respective end-of-period exchange rates.  Changes in annualized premiums in force are translated at weighted-average exchange rates.  The following table presents the changes in annualized premiums in force for AFLAC Japan for the years ended December 31:

Our persistency has declined slightly during the three-year period ended December 31, 2003, mainly due to the depressed economic conditions in Japan and the increasing block of directly-issued business, which is generally less persistent than payroll business in Japan.  Total new annualized premium sales in yen were: 121.2 billion yen in 2003, up 11.9%; 108.3 billion yen in 2002, up 17.9%; and 91.9 billion yen in 2001, down 7.9%.  The increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of 7.9% in 2003, 6.7% in 2002 and 5.6% in 2001, reflect the high persistency of AFLAC Japan's business and the sales of new policies.  For further information regarding the Japanese economy and its effect on our operations, see Exhibit 13, page 13-14, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Insurance - U.S.

AFLAC U.S. earned premium income by major product categories is summarized in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 13, page 13-48.  The following table sets forth the changes in annualized premiums in force for AFLAC U.S. insurance for the years ended December 31.

Total new annualized premium sales were: $1.1 billion in 2003, up 5.4%; $1.1 billion in 2002, up 16.4%; and $919 million in 2001, up 29.1%.  The increases in annualized premiums in force of 13.8% in 2003, 19.5% in 2002 and 20.3% in 2001 were favorably affected by increased sales at the worksite primarily through cafeteria plans and a slight improvement in the persistency of several products.

Insurance Products - Japan

AFLAC Japan's insurance products are designed to help consumers pay for medical and nonmedical costs that are not reimbursed under Japan's national health insurance system.

In 2002, we introduced EVER, a whole life fixed-benefit medical product that was developed to address consumer interest in whole-life medical insurance as a result of health care legislation that increased out-of-pocket costs for most Japanese consumers in April 2003.  Stand-alone medical products accounted for 28% of total sales in 2003 and 18% in 2002.  We believe that EVER will continue to be a popular product and a solid contributor to sales.

We also introduced a whole life version of our Rider MAX product in 2002.  Conversions to the new whole life version of Rider MAX, which provides accident and medical/sickness benefits, favorably impacted total sales in both 2003 and 2002, with the larger impact occurring in 2002.  For policy conversions, new annualized premium sales include only the incremental annualized premium amount over the original term policy.  Rider MAX accounted for 27% of total sales in 2003, 31% in 2002 and 25% in 2001.  We believe that sales contributions from conversions will continue to have less of an effect on total new annualized premium sales in future periods.

The cancer life insurance plans we offer in Japan provide a fixed daily benefit for hospitalization and outpatient services related to cancer and a lump-sum benefit upon initial diagnosis of internal cancer. The plans differ from the AFLAC U.S. cancer plans (described below) in that the Japanese policies also provide death benefits and many have cash surrender values.  We estimate that approximately 22% of the premiums earned from all cancer life plans are associated with these benefits.  Cancer life sales accounted for 27% of total sales in 2003, 33% in 2002 and 51% in 2001.

I-5


The ordinary life products that we offer in Japan provide death benefits and may include cash surrender values. These products are available as stand-alone policies and riders.  Life production accounted for 13% of sales in 2003, compared with 13% in 2002 and 15% in 2001.

We also offer a living benefit life plan and accident and care policies in Japan.  Mainly sold as a rider, the living benefit life plan is a life insurance product that provides lump-sum benefits when policyholders experience either heart attack or stroke.  Our accident insurance policy provides benefits for inpatient and outpatient treatment and surgery due to accidents.  Our care insurance provides periodic benefits to those who become bedridden, demented, or seriously disabled due to illness or accident.  These products individually accounted for less than 5% of total new annualized premium sales in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003.

Insurance Products - U.S.

We design our U.S. insurance products to provide supplemental coverage for people who already have major medical or primary insurance coverage.  Our health insurance plans are guaranteed-renewable for the lifetime of the policyholder (to age 70 for short-term disability policies). We cannot cancel guaranteed-renewable coverage, but we can increase premium rates on existing and future policies by class of policy in response to higher than originally expected claims experience (subject to federal and state loss-ratio guidelines) on a uniform, nondiscriminatory basis.  Any premium rate increases are subject to state regulatory approval.  With the exception of our Medicare supplement product, which is a closed block of business, we have had minimal rate increase activity in the last five years.

AFLAC U.S. offers an accident and disability policy to protect against losses resulting from accidents.  The accident portion of the policy includes lump-sum benefits for accidental death, dismemberment and specific injuries as well as fixed benefits for hospital confinement.  Optional disability riders are also available.  Short-term disability policies provide disability benefits with a variety of elimination period/benefit period options. The longest such benefit period offered is two years.  During 2003, we began introducing revised versions of our accident and disability products throughout the United States.  Accident/disability coverage continued to be our best-selling product category, accounting for 51% of total sales in 2003, 51% in 2002 and 52% in 2001.

Our U.S. cancer plans are designed to provide insurance benefits for medical and nonmedical costs that are generally not reimbursed by major medical insurance.  During 2003, we also began introducing a revised version of our cancer product.  Benefits include a first-occurrence benefit that pays an initial amount when internal cancer is first diagnosed, a fixed amount for each day an insured is hospitalized for cancer treatment, and benefits for medical, radiation, chemotherapy, surgery and a "wellness" benefit applicable toward certain diagnostic tests.  Cancer expense insurance accounted for 20% of total sales in 2003, 21% in 2002 and 24% in 2001.

In 2002, we introduced a personal sickness indemnity plan, which provides a fixed daily benefit for hospitalization due to sickness and physician services for accident or sickness.  Our hospital indemnity product provides a fixed daily benefit for hospitalization due to accident or sickness.  Our hospital indemnity product category, which includes these plans, contributed 11% of total sales in 2003, 10% in 2002 and 6% in 2001.

We also offer a series of fixed-benefit dental policies, providing various levels of benefits for dental procedures, including check-ups and cleanings.  Plan features include a renewal guarantee, no deductible and a choice of dentist.  The policies are portable and pay regardless of other insurance.  Our dental insurance generated 7% of total sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

I-6


AFLAC U.S. offers term and whole life policies sold through payroll deduction at the worksite and various term and whole life policies on a direct basis.  We also offer other health insurance products including qualified and non-qualified long-term care plans, a hospital intensive care policy, and a specified health event policy.  These products individually contributed less than 5% of total sales in each of 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Distribution - Japan

Our largest distribution channel is the "corporate agency" system.  Affiliated corporate agencies contributed 37% of total new annualized premium sales in both 2003 and 2002, and 41% in 2001.  Affiliated corporate agencies are formed when companies establish subsidiary businesses to sell our products to their employees, suppliers and customers.  These agencies help us reach employees at 93% of the companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

We also sell our products through independent corporate agencies and individual agencies that are not affiliated with large companies.  Agents' activities are primarily limited to insurance sales, with customer service support provided by our main office in Tokyo and 89 offices throughout Japan.

As of December 31, 2003, there were approximately 14,640 agencies in Japan with more than 64,900 licensed agents, compared with approximately 12,050 agencies and 58,100 licensed agents a year ago.  We believe that new agencies will continue to be attracted to AFLAC Japan's high commissions, superior products, customer service and brand image.

We have also been utilizing our marketing alliance with Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. (Dai-ichi Life) to improve our reach in Japan through Dai-ichi Life's sales force of 48,000 people.  Sales of AFLAC products by Dai-ichi Life commenced in April 2001.  Dai-ichi Life sold 305,600 of our cancer life policies in 2003, compared with 359,500 policies in 2002 and 265,200 policies in 2001.  Contributions to total new annualized premium sales were 10% in 2003, 11% in 2002 and 2001.

Distribution - U.S.

Our U.S. sales force comprises independent sales agents who are licensed to sell accident and health insurance. Many are also licensed to sell life insurance.  Most agents' efforts are directed toward selling supplemental health insurance at the worksite.  The average number of U.S. agents actively producing business on a monthly basis during 2003 was 17,200, compared with 15,800 in 2002 and 13,000 in 2001.

During 2003, we took several steps to enhance our distribution system by expanding the field management network that supports our sales force.  For further information regarding changes in our U.S. distribution system, see Exhibit 13, page 13-15 (AFLAC U.S. Sales section of MD&A), which is incorporated herein by reference.

Agents' activities are principally limited to sales.  Administrative personnel in Columbus, Georgia; Albany, New York; and Omaha, Nebraska, handle policyholder service functions, including issuance of policies, premium collection, payment notices and claims.  Agents are paid commissions based on first and renewal-year premiums from their sales of insurance products.  State, regional and district sales coordinators are also independent agents and are compensated by override commissions and bonuses.

I-7


We have concentrated on marketing our products at the worksite.  This method offers policies to individuals through common media such as employment, trade and other associations.  This manner of marketing is distinct from the "group" insurance sales approach, as our primary method of enrollment results from the individual insured being directly contacted by the sales associate.  Policies are individually underwritten, with premiums generally paid by the employee.  Additionally, AFLAC policies are portable, meaning that individuals may retain their full insurance coverage upon separation from employment or such affiliation, generally at the same premium. A major portion of premiums on such sales are collected through payroll deduction or other forms of centralized billings.  Worksite-marketing enables the agency force to reach a greater number of prospective policyholders and lowers distribution costs, compared with individually marketed business.

Another valuable marketing and sales tool is the flexible benefits program, or cafeteria plan, which allows an employee to pay for many of AFLAC's products using pretax dollars.  These programs help achieve increased penetration, as agents are required to present the program to all employees in a payroll account.

In 2003, AFLAC U.S. collected premiums were $2.6 billion, 8.2% of which was collected in Texas, 7.0% in Florida and 6.0% in California.  Collected premiums in all other states were individually less than 5% of AFLAC U.S. premiums.

Competition - Japan

In 1974, AFLAC became the second foreign (non-Japanese) life insurance company to gain direct access to the Japanese insurance market by obtaining an operating license.  Through 1981, we were the only company in Japan authorized to sell a cancer life insurance policy.  In January 2001, Japan's insurance market was deregulated, and we experienced an increase in the number of companies selling products that compete with our policies.  However, based on our growth of premiums in force, producing agents and customer accounts, we do not believe that our market position has been significantly impacted by increased competition as a result of deregulation.  Furthermore, we believe the continued development and maintenance of operating efficiencies will allow us to offer affordable products at a better value to consumers.

AFLAC has had substantial success selling cancer life policies in Japan, with 14.0 million cancer life policies in force as of December 31, 2003.  We believe we will remain a leading provider of cancer life insurance coverage in Japan, principally due to our long experience in the market, low-cost operations, unique marketing system (see Distribution - Japan above) and product expertise developed in the United States.

Competition - U.S.

There are approximately 2,000 life and accident and health insurance companies operating in the United States. We compete against several insurers on a national basis plus other insurers regionally.  We believe that our policies and premium rates as well as the commissions paid to our sales agents are competitive with those offered by other companies providing similar types of insurance.  However, we believe that our U.S. business is distinct from our competitors because of our product focus, distribution system, and name awareness.  For most of the other companies that sell supplemental insurance, it represents a secondary business.  For us, it is our only business and allows us to focus on exploring new product opportunities while also enhancing our existing products.  By doing so, we believe we offer the best value in the market.  We also believe that our growing distribution system of independent sales associates expands our business opportunities, while our advertising c
ampaigns have increased our name awareness and branding efforts.

I-8


Private insurers and voluntary and cooperative plans, such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield, provide insurance for meeting basic hospitalization and medical expenses.  Much of this insurance is sold on a group basis. The federal and state governments also pay substantial costs of medical treatment through Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such major medical insurance generally covers a substantial amount of the medical (but not nonmedical) expenses incurred by an insured as a result of accident and disability, cancer or other major illnesses. AFLAC's policies are designed to provide coverage that is supplemental to that provided by major medical insurance and may also be used to defray nonmedical expenses.  Thus, we compete only indirectly with major medical insurers.  However, the scope of major medical coverage offered by other insurers does represent a potential limitation on the market for our products.  Accordingly, expansion of coverage by other insurers, or governmental pr
ograms, could adversely affect our business opportunities.  Conversely, any reduction of coverage, such as increased deductibles and co-payments, by other insurers or governmental programs could favorably affect our business opportunities.

Investments and Investment Results

The following table shows an analysis of investment securities as of December 31:

Net investment income was $1.8 billion in 2003 and $1.6 billion in both 2002 and 2001.  Net investment income has been relatively flat during the last three years primarily as a result of low available investment yields for new money in both Japan and the United States.  In particular, Japan's life insurance industry has contended with low investment yields for a number of years.  Based on financial results determined in accordance with the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) requirements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, AFLAC Japan had the highest portfolio yield among all of Japan's life insurers with assets in excess of 2 trillion yen for 2003, 2002 and 2001.  AFLAC Japan earned this distinction while maintaining a debt security portfolio in which 97.2% and 97.9% of the securities were classified as investment grade as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

For information on the composition of our investment portfolio and investment results, see Exhibit 13, pages 13-13 to 13-14, 13-15, 13-20 to 13-27, and 13-30 to 13-31 (discussions relating to investments, balance sheet and cash flow) and pages 13-51 to 13-64 (Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which are incorporated herein by reference.

Investments - Japan

Yen-denominated debt securities accounted for 93% of AFLAC Japan's total debt securities as of December 31, 2003 and 93% of AFLAC Japan's total debt securities as of December 31, 2002.  The following table presents the composition, based on cost or amortized cost, of total investments and cash for AFLAC Japan ($35.5 billion in 2003 and $31.0 billion in 2002) as of December 31:

Funds available for investment include cash flows from operations and funds generated from bond swaps, maturities and redemptions.  AFLAC Japan purchased debt security investments totaling approximately 535.1 billion yen in 2003 ($4.6 billion using the 2003 weighted-average exchange rate), 564.8 billion yen in 2002 ($4.5 billion using the 2002 weighted-average exchange rate) and 444.6 billion yen in 2001 ($3.7 billion using the 2001 weighted-average exchange rate).  In 2003, 87.5% of the total yen-denominated purchases represented new money invested at an average yield of 3.20% to support our operational needs.  Shorter-dated investments used to manage cash flow needs represented 8.9% of yen-denominated purchases and bond swap activity accounted for the remaining 3.6% of yen-denominated purchases.  Dollar-denominated new money, which represented 90.2% of total dollar-denominated purchases, was invested at an average yield of 6.26%.  Dollar-denominated bond swaps accounted for
 the remaining 9.8% of total dollar-denominated purchases.  In 2002, 67.4% of the total yen-denominated purchases represented new money invested at an average yield of 3.65% to support our operational needs.  Bond swap activity accounted for 21.0% of yen-denominated purchases and shorter-dated investments used to manage cash flow needs represented the remaining 11.6% of yen-denominated purchases.  Dollar-denominated new money, which accounted for 58.5% of total dollar-denominated purchases, was invested at an average yield of 7.39%.  Dollar-denominated bond swaps accounted for the remaining 41.5% of total dollar-denominated purchases.  In 2001, 84.9% of the total yen-denominated purchases represented new money invested at an average yield of 3.58% to support our operational needs.  Bond swap activity represented the remaining 15.1% of yen-denominated purchases.  Dollar-denominated new money, which accounted for 59.3% of total dollar-denominated purchases, was invested at an average yield of 7.69%.  Dollar-de
nominated bond swaps represented the remaining 40.7% of dollar-denominated purchases.

We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments.  Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis.  All of AFLAC Japan's securities have ratings from either a nationally recognized security rating organization or the Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).

I-11


Funds available for investment include cash flows from operations and funds generated from bond swaps, maturities and redemptions.  Purchases of investments by AFLAC U.S. were approximately $1.8 billion in 2003, $1.2 billion in 2002 and $1.6 billion in 2001.  In 2003, of the total available funds, 96.1% was invested in corporate fixed-maturity securities at an average yield of 6.53% and 3.9% was invested in U.S. government or agency securities at an average yield of 5.37%.  AFLAC U.S. invested 92.6% in corporate fixed-maturity securities in 2002 at an average yield of 7.58% and 1.0% in U.S. government or government agency securities at an average yield of 6.01%.  In 2003 and 2002, we directed more funds to the corporate fixed-maturity security market due to the low yields available on U.S. government and government agency securities.  AFLAC U.S. invested 93.9% in corporate fixed-maturity securities in 2001 at an average yield of 7.78% and .6% in U.S. government or government 
agency securities at an average yield of 6.32%.

We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments.  Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis.  All of AFLAC's U.S. securities have ratings from either a nationally recognized security rating organization or the SVO of the NAIC.

Regulation - Japan

A portion of AFLAC Japan's annual earnings, as determined on a Japanese statutory accounting basis, can be transferred (repatriated) each year to AFLAC U.S. after complying with solvency margin provisions and satisfying various conditions imposed by Japanese regulatory authorities for protecting policyholders.  Payments are also made from AFLAC Japan to the Parent Company for management fees and to AFLAC U.S. for allocated expenses.  Repatriated profits represent a portion of the after-tax earnings reported to the FSA on a March 31 fiscal year basis.  Japanese regulatory basis earnings are determined using accounting principles that differ materially from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  Under Japanese statutory accounting practices, premium income is recognized on a cash basis, policy acquisition costs are charged off immediately, policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are different, policyholder protection
 fund obligations are not accrued, and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized on a different basis.

The FSA maintains its own solvency standards, a version of U.S. risk-based capital requirements, which are used by regulators in Japan to monitor the financial strength of insurance companies.  AFLAC Japan's solvency margin continues to significantly exceed regulatory minimums.  The FSA may not allow transfers of funds if the transfers would cause AFLAC Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders.  We do not expect these requirements to adversely affect the funds available for remittances of earnings and payments of allocated expenses and management fees.

AFLAC Japan files annual reports and financial statements for the Japanese insurance operations based on a March 31 year end, prepared in accordance with Japanese regulatory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the FSA.  Also, financial and other affairs of AFLAC Japan are subject to examination by the FSA.  Reconciliations of AFLAC Japan net assets on a GAAP basis to net assets determined on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis as of December 31 were as follows:

In 1998, the Japanese government established the Life Insurance Policyholders Protection Corporation (LIPPC). For further information regarding the policyholder protection fund, see Exhibit 13, page 13-50, Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For additional information regarding AFLAC Japan's operations and regulations, see Exhibit 13, pages 13-10 to 13-14 (AFLAC Japan section of MD&A) and pages 13-47 to 13-50 and 13-72 to 13-74 (Notes 2 and 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which are incorporated herein by reference.  Our branch in Japan is also subject to regulation and supervision in the United States as described below.

Regulation - U.S.

The Parent Company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to state regulations in the United States as an insurance holding company system.  Such regulations generally provide that transactions between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable.  In addition, transfer of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries and material transactions between companies within the system are subject to prior notice to, or approval by, state regulatory authorities.

AFLAC, in common with all U.S. insurance companies, is subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business.  In general, the insurance laws of the various jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to, among other things: granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, prior approval of forms of policies and premium rate increases, standards of solvency and maintenance of specified policy benefit reserves and minimum loss ratio requirements, capital for the protection of policyholders, limitations on dividends to shareholders, the nature of and limitations on investments, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, filing of financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory insurance accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities, and periodic examinations of the market conduct, financial, and other affai
rs of insurance companies.

The NAIC revised and codified statutory accounting principles to promote standardization throughout the industry.  We adopted these new accounting principles effective January 1, 2001. The NAIC also has various ongoing initiatives relating to insurance products, investments, revisions to the risk-based capital formula and other actuarial and accounting matters.

The NAIC uses a risk-based capital formula relating to insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk to facilitate identification by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer's operations.  The formulas for determining the amount of risk-based capital specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk.  Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company's regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level risk-based capital as defined by the NAIC.  Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action.  The levels are company action, regulatory action, authorized control and mandatory control.  AFLAC's NAIC risk-based capital ratio remains high and reflects a very str
ong capital and surplus position.

Under insurance guaranty association laws in most U.S. states, insurance companies doing business in those states can be assessed for policyholder losses up to prescribed limits that are incurred by insolvent companies with similar lines of business.  Such assessments have not been material to us in the past.  We believe that future assessments relating to companies in the United States currently involved in insolvency proceedings will not materially impact the consolidated financial statements.

For further information concerning AFLAC U.S. operations, regulation and dividend restrictions, see Exhibit 13, pages 13-14 to 13-15 (AFLAC U.S. section of MD&A) and pages 13-47 to 13-50 and 13-72 to 13-74 (Notes 2 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which are incorporated herein by reference.

Policy Liabilities - Japan and U.S.

The reserves for policy liabilities reported in the financial statements have been computed in accordance with GAAP.  These reserves differ from those reflected in the various regulatory financial statements filed by AFLAC and AFLAC Japan. Such differences arise from the use of different mortality, morbidity, interest and lapse assumptions, and actuarial reserving methods as required by regulatory authorities in the U.S. and Japan.

Employees

AFLAC Japan had 2,803 full-time employees as of December 31, 2003.  AFLAC U.S. had 3,383 full-time employees as of December 31, 2003.  We consider our employee relations to be excellent.

Other Operations

Our other operations include the Parent Company and a printing subsidiary.  These operations had 287 full-time employees as of December 31, 2003.  We consider our relations with these employees to be excellent.  For additional information on our other operations, see Exhibit 13, page 13-16 (Other Operations section of MD&A), which is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

AFLAC owns land and buildings that comprise two primary campuses located in Columbus, Georgia.  The first campus, located on approximately 54 acres of land, includes buildings that serve as our worldwide headquarters and house administrative support functions for our U.S. operations.  The approximate square footage of the buildings on this campus is 600,000 square feet.  The second campus, located on approximately 104 acres of land, includes a building with approximately 270,000 square feet that provides additional support functions for our U.S. operations.  AFLAC also leases administrative office space in Albany, New York, and Omaha, Nebraska.

In Tokyo, Japan, AFLAC owns an administrative office building and a training facility with approximately 344,000 square feet.  AFLAC also leases additional office space in Tokyo along with regional sales offices located throughout the country.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the normal course of business.  Some of this litigation is pending in states where large punitive damages bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs have been awarded against other companies, including insurers, in recent years.  Although the final results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the outcome of pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
