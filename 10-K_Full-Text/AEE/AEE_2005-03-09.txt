STATEMENTS

Statements
in this report not based on historical facts are considered “forward-looking”
and, accordingly, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those discussed. Although such forward-looking
statements have been made in good faith and are based on reasonable assumptions,
there is no assurance that the expected results will be achieved. These
statements include (without limitation) statements as to future expectations,
beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions, and financial
performance. In connection with the “safe harbor” provi-sions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are providing this cautionary
statement to identify important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those anticipated. The following factors, in addition to
those discussed elsewhere in this report and in our other filings with the SEC,
could cause actual results to differ materially from management expectations as
suggested by such forward-looking statements:

·

regulatory
      actions, including changes in regulatory policies and ratemaking
      determinations;

·

changes
      in laws and other governmental actions, including monetary and fiscal
      policies;

·

the
      effects of increased competition in the future due to, among other things,
      deregulation of certain aspects of our business at both the state and
      federal levels, and the implementation of deregulation, such as when the
      current electric rate freeze and current power supply contracts expire in
      Illinois in 2006;

the
      effects of participation in the MISO;

·

the
      availability of fuel for the production of electricity, such as coal and
      natural gas, and purchased power and natural gas for distribution, and the
      level and volatility of future market prices for such commodities,
      including the ability to recover any increased
costs;

·

the
      effectiveness of our risk management strategies and the use of financial
      and derivative instruments;

·

prices
      for power in the Midwest;

·

business
      and economic conditions, including their impact on interest rates;

·

disruptions
      of the capital markets or other events that make the Ameren Companies’
      access to necessary capital more difficult or
costly;

·

the
      impact of the adoption of new accounting standards and the application of
      appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance;

·

actions
      of credit ratings agencies and the effects of such actions;

·

weather
      conditions and other natural phenomena;

·

generation
      plant construction, installation and performance;

·

operation
      of UE’s nuclear power facility, including planned and unplanned outages,
      and decommissioning costs;

·

the
      effects of strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and divestitures;

·

the
      impact of current environmental regulations on utilities and power
      generating companies and the expectation that more stringent requirements
      will be introduced over time, which could have a negative financial
      effect;

·

labor
      disputes, future wages and employee benefits costs, including changes in
      returns on benefit plan assets;

·

difficulties
      in integrating IP with Ameren’s other
businesses;

·

changes
      in the energy markets, environmental laws or regulations, interest rates,
      or other factors that could adversely affect assumptions in connection
      with the CILCORP and IP acquisitions;


·

the
      impact of conditions imposed by regulators in connection with their
      approval of Ameren’s acquisition of IP;

·

the
      inability of our counterparties to meet their obligations with respect to
      our contracts and financial instruments;

·

the
      cost and availability of transmission capacity for the energy generated by
      the Ameren Companies’ generating

facilities
      or required to satisfy energy sales made by the Ameren Companies;

·

legal
      and administrative proceedings; and

·

acts
      of sabotage, war or terrorist activities.

Given
these uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on these
forward-looking statements. Except to the extent required by the federal
securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any
forward-looking statements to reflect new information, future events, or
otherwise.

PART
I

ITEM
1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL

Ameren,
headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company
registered with the SEC under the PUHCA. Ameren was formed in 1997 by the merger
of UE and CIPSCO, the former parent company of CIPS. Ameren acquired CILCORP in
2003 and IP in 2004. Ameren’s primary asset is the common stock of its
subsidiaries, including UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP. Ameren’s subsidiaries
operate rate-regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution
businesses, rate-regulated natural gas distribution businesses, and
non-rate-regulated electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois.
Dividends on Ameren’s common stock are dependent on distributions made to it by
its subsidiaries. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our
financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a more detailed
description of the Ameren Companies and the development of their businesses.

The
following table presents our total employees at December 31, 2004:

Ameren

CIPS

Genco

CILCORP

(parent)

CILCO

IP

9,388

(a)

3,944





1,722

(a) Total
for Ameren includes Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant
subsidiaries.

The IBEW, the IUOE, the NCF&O, and the Laborers and Gas Fitters
labor unions represent approximately 63% of Ameren’s total employees, and 73%,
68%, 67%, 63%, 63% and 70% of the employees of UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO
and IP, respectively. An IBEW contract representing a portion of UE workers
expires in 2006. Contracts with the Laborers and Gas Fitters labor unions that
represent a portion of IP employees also expire in 2006. IP is in discussions to
have those agreements extended. The remaining agreements covering UE, CIPS,
Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP employees expire in 2007.

For additional information regarding our business operations and
factors affecting our operations and financial position, see Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under
Part II, Item 7, of this report and Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. For
additional information regarding reporting segments, see Note 18 - Segment
Information to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
report.

RATES AND REGULATION

Rates

Rates that UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are allowed to charge for their
services are the single most important item influencing their and Ameren’s
consolidated results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The rates
charged to UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP customers are determined by governmental
organizations. Decisions by these organizations are influenced by many factors,
including the cost of providing service, the quality of service, regulatory
staff knowledge and experience, economic conditions, public policy, and social
and political views. Decisions made by these organizations regarding rates could
have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position and
liquidity of UE, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and Ameren on a consolidated
basis.

UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are subject to regulation by the ICC. UE is
also subject to regulation by the MoPSC, as to rates, service, issuance of
equity securities, issuance of debt having a maturity of more than 12 months,
mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other matters. Genco is not subject
to regulation by the ICC or the MoPSC. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters
to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for
information regarding UE’s proposed discontinuance of its utility operations
subject to ICC


jurisdiction by transferring its Illinois-based electric and natural
gas transmission and distribution business to CIPS.

UE, CIPS,
Genco, CILCO and IP are also subject to regulation by the FERC as to their
ability to charge market-based rates in connection with the wholesale sale of
energy and transmission in interstate commerce, mergers, affiliate transactions,
and various other matters. Less than 5% of our electric revenues relate to
transmission revenues regulated by the FERC. Issuance of short-term and
long-term debt by Genco is subject to approval by the FERC.

The
following table presents the approximate percentage of electric operating
revenues subject to regulation by the MoPSC and the ICC for each of the Ameren
Companies for the year ended December 31, 2004:

intercompany

eliminations.

If
certain criteria are met, UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s electric and gas rates
may be adjusted without the necessity of a traditional rate proceeding. PGA
clauses allow for prudently incurred natural gas purchase costs to be passed
directly to the consumer in Missouri and Illinois. There is no similar provision
that would allow regulated electric operations fuel or purchased power costs to
pass directly to the consumer. Environmental adjustment rate riders authorized
by the ICC permit the recovery of prudently incurred MGP remediation and
litigation costs from UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s Illinois electric and
natural gas utility customers. As a part of the order approving Ameren’s
acquisition of IP, the ICC authorized IP to implement a tariff rider to recover
90% of the costs of asbestos-related litigation claims in excess of $20 million
from its electric utility customers, subject to certain terms, beginning in
2007. MoPSC natural gas pipeline replacement cost clauses allow the recovery of
infrastructure replacement costs from gas utility customers. However, UE agreed
to not seek recovery under these clauses before January 1, 2006, in conjunction
with its 2003 Missouri gas rate case settlement.

For
further information on rate matters, including UE’s 2002 Missouri electric rate
case settlement, UE’s 2004 Missouri gas rate case settlement, IP’s 2004 pending
gas rate case, and the ending of rate moratoriums in Missouri and Illinois in
2006, see Results of Operations in Management’s Dis-cussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7,
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item
7A, and Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 15 - Commitments and
Contingencies

to our
financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

General
Regulatory Matters

As a
holding company registered with the SEC under the PUHCA, Ameren is subject to
the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA, including provisions relating to the
issuance of securities, sales and acquisitions of securities and utility assets,
affiliate transactions, financial reporting requirements, the services performed
by Ameren Services and AFS, and the activities of certain other subsidi-aries.
Issuance of common stock and short-term and long-term debt and other securities
by Ameren and CILCORP and issuance of debt having a maturity of 12 months or
less by UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are subject to approval by the SEC under the
PUHCA.

Genco is
certified by the FERC as an “exempt wholesale generator” under the Energy Policy
Act of 1992; Genco is not a “public utility company” under the PUHCA. As an
exempt wholesale generator, Genco is exempt from most of the provisions of the
PUHCA that otherwise would apply to it as a subsidiary of a registered holding
company. Issuance of securities by Genco is not subject to approval by the SEC
under the PUHCA. The SEC may impose limitations on Ameren in connection with its
financing for the purpose of investing in exempt wholesale generators and
foreign utility companies if Ameren’s aggregate investment in those activities
exceeds 50% of its consolidated retained earnings. At December 31, 2004,
Ameren’s aggregate invest-ment in exempt wholesale generators was 32% of its
consolidated retained earnings. Ameren has no investment in foreign utility
companies.

Operation
of UE’s Callaway nuclear plant is subject to regulation by the NRC. Its Facility
Operating License expires on October 18, 2024. UE’s Osage hydroelectric
plant and UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydro plant, as licensed projects under
the Federal Power Act, are subject to the FERC regulations affecting, among
other things, the general operation and maintenance of the projects. The license
for the Osage plant expires on February 28, 2006, and the license for the Taum
Sauk plant expires on June 30, 2010. In November


2004, the
FERC formally accepted UE’s February 2004 license renewal application and
solicited terms and conditions from the U.S. Department of Interior and various
state agencies to renew the license for its Osage hydroelectric plant for an
additional 50-year term. UE’s Keokuk plant and dam located in the Mississippi
River between Hamilton, Illinois and Keokuk, Iowa, are operated under authority,
unlimited in time, granted by an Act of Congress in 1905.

Environmental
Matters

Certain
of our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental
statutes or regulations relating to the safety and health of personnel, the
public, and the environment, including the identification, generation, storage,
handling, transportation, disposal, record-keeping, labeling, reporting of and
emergency response in connection with hazardous and toxic materials, safety and
health standards, and environmental protection requirements, including
stan-dards and limitations relating to the discharge of air and water
pollutants. Failure to comply with those statutes or regulations could have
material adverse effects on us, including the imposition of criminal or civil
liability by regulatory agencies or civil fines and liability to private
parties, and the required expenditure of funds to bring us into compliance. We
believe that we are in material compliance with existing statutes and
regulations.

SUPPLY
FOR ELECTRIC POWER

During
2004, the Ameren Companies’ peak demand from retail and wholesale customers was
15,991 megawatts and the peak capability to deliver power from owned generation
and power supply agreements was 19,439 megawatts. Forecasted peak demand from
retail and wholesale customers for 2005 is 17,441 megawatts. Ameren-owned
generation and purchased power are used to meet the energy needs of our
customers with a 15% reserve margin. Factors that could cause us to purchase
power include, among other things, absence of sufficient owned generation,
generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, and the availability of
power at a cost lower than our cost of generating it.

The
acquisition of IP included IP’s rate-regulated electric and gas transmission and
distribution business. IP owns no significant generation assets; it obtains
almost all of the electricity that it supplies to retail customers through
short-term and long-term power purchase agreements. For additional information
on IP’s power purchase agreements, see Note 2 - Acquisitions to our financial
statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

Coal

UE, Genco
and CILCO have agreements in place for the purchase of coal to supply electric
generating facilities through 2010. Coal supply agreements typically have an
initial term of five years, with approximately 20% of the contracts expiring
annually. As of December 31, 2004, almost 92% of UE’s, Genco’s and CILCO’s
expected 2005 coal usage was under contract, and approximately 58% of the
expected coal usage for 2006 to 2009 was under contract. Ameren burned 38
million tons of coal in 2004.

UE, Genco
and CILCO have a policy of maintaining coal inventory consistent with their
historical usage. Inventory levels may be adjusted because of uncertainties of
supply due to potential work stoppages, delays in coal deliveries, equipment
breakdowns, and other factors. The following table presents the number of days
supply of coal in inventory as of December 31, 2004 and 2003:



Ameren



UE

CILCORP

and
      CILCO



Nuclear

UE has
agreements or inventories to fulfill its Callaway nuclear plant needs for
uranium and conversion, enrichment and fabrication services through 2006. UE
expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply
nuclear fuel. UE is a member of Fuelco, which provides benefits to UE and
Fuelco’s other members in all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle. UE is able to
combine its fuel needs with the other members, and thereby increase its
purchasing power and the opportunities for volume discount pricing. In addition,
Fuelco is able to pursue sources of supply that would not otherwise be available
to UE alone. Diversification of supply is enhanced and security of supply is
better managed collectively. In fuel fabrication, UE is able to draw upon the
expertise of the other members to enhance fuel performance. The Callaway nuclear
plant normally requires refueling at 18-month intervals. The last refueling took
place in May and June 2004; the next refueling is scheduled for September 2005.

Natural
Gas Supply for Power Generation

Our
natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate
delivery of natural gas to our generating units. We do this by optimizing
transportation and storage options; by minimizing cost and price risk through
various supply and price hedging agreements that allow us to maintain access to
multiple gas pools, supply basins, and storage; and by reducing the impact of
price volatility. For 2005, 96% of the estimated required natural gas supply for
generation was under contract; 35% of the required gas supply was hedged for
price risk as of December 31, 2004.


Purchased
Power

We
believe that we can obtain enough purchased power to meet future needs. However,
during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power may
be significantly affected. The Ameren transmission system has a minimum of 18
direct connections to other control areas, which allow access to numerous
sources of supply. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are members of the MISO. Effective
April 1, 2005, the MISO is expected to begin operating a newly designed market
that is expected to offer improved transparency of power pricing and efficiency
in generation dispatch.

Through
the end of 2006, CIPS, CILCO and IP have contracts in place to supply almost all
of their power needs. For a description of IP’s primary power supply contract
with Dynegy and a description of CIPS’ and CILCO’s power supply contracts with
affiliates, see Note 2 - Acquisitions and Note 14 - Related Party Transactions
to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

On
December 31, 2006, the current Illinois electric rate freeze expires, as do the
supply contracts for generation to serve the power requirements of CIPS, CILCO
and IP. Prior to December 31, 2006, determinations must be made as to how all
Illinois electric distribution companies will procure their generation needs and
how they will set future rates for the generation components and delivery
service components of customer rates.

During
2004, the ICC held workshops to get input from interested parties on the
framework to be used for retail electric rate determination and generation
procurement after the current Illinois electric rate freeze and supply contracts
expire on December 31, 2006. A report issued by the ICC in late 2004, outlined a
process that received strong support in the workshops: It would have CIPS, CILCO
and IP procure power through an auction monitored by the ICC. The form of power
supply would meet the full requirements of the utility, and the risk of
fluctuations in power requirements would be borne by the supplier. In addition,
the report noted that many stakeholders, including Ameren, supported a process
whereby the price of power resulting from the auction would be the price used to
determine the generation component of customer rates. This price of power would
be charged to customers by a pass-through mechanism. With regard to the delivery
service component of customer rates, it is expected that all Illinois delivery
service companies will file rate cases, at which time the delivery service
component of customer rates will be updated. Genco and AERG would probably
participate in the auction, but there may be a limit imposed by the ICC on the
maximum amount of power they could supply CIPS, CILCO and IP. In February 2005,
CIPS, CILCO and IP filed with the ICC: A proposed format for the generation
procurement auction, a rate mechanism to pass generation costs through to
customers, and a process to update the delivery service portion of rates, among
other things. These proposals are subject to review and approval by the ICC
within 11 months of the filings. In addition, the Illinois legislature began
hearings in February 2005 regarding the framework for retail rate determination
and generation procurement. We cannot predict what actions, if any, the Illinois
legislature will take, or whether the ICC will approve our proposals for
generation procurement or electric rate determination.

NATURAL
GAS SUPPLY FOR DISTRIBUTION

UE, CIPS,
CILCO and IP are responsible for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to
their gas utility customers. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP develop and manage a
portfolio of gas supply resources, including firm gas supply under term
agreements with producers, interstate and intrastate firm transportation
capacity, firm storage capacity leased from interstate pipelines, and on-system
storage facilities to maintain gas deliveries to our customers throughout the
year and especially during periods of peak demand. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP
primarily use the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, Trunkline Gas Company,
Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, Mississippi River Transmission
Corporation, and Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation interstate pipeline
systems for transportation of natural gas to our systems. In addition to
physical transactions, financial instruments, including the NYMEX futures market
and OTC financial markets are used to hedge the price paid for natural gas.
Prudently incurred natural gas purchase costs are passed on to UE, CIPS, CILCO
and IP gas customers in Illinois and Missouri dollar-for-dollar under PGA
clauses, subject to review by the ICC and the MoPSC.

INDUSTRY
ISSUES

We are
facing issues common to the electric and gas utility industry. These issues
include:

·

the
      potential for more intense competition in generation and
      supply;

·

the
      potential for changes in the structure of
regulation;

·

changes
      in the structure of the industry as a result of changes in federal and
      state laws, including the


formation
      of non-rate-regulated generating entities and regional transmission
      organizations;

·

fluctuations
      in power prices due to the balance of supply and demand and commodity
      prices;

·

continually
      developing and complex environmental laws, regulations and issues,
      including proposed new air-quality
standards;

·

public
      concern about the siting of new facilities;

·

construction
      of new power generating facilities;

·

proposals
      for programs to encourage energy efficiency and renewable sources of
      power;

·

public
      concerns about nuclear plant operation and decommissioning and the
      disposal of nuclear waste;

·

consolidation
      of electric and gas companies; and

·

global
      climate issues.

We are
monitoring these issues. We are unable to predict at this time what impact, if
any, these issues will have on our results of operations, financial position, or
liquidity. For additional information, see Outlook and Regulatory Matters in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report and Note 3 - Rate and
Regulatory Matters and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our financial
statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

RISK
FACTORS

Ameren
may not be able to integrate IP successfully into its other businesses or
achieve the benefits it anticipates.

Ameren
cannot ensure that it will be able to integrate IP successfully with its other
businesses. The integration of IP with its other businesses will present
significant challenges; Ameren may not be able to operate the combined company
as effectively as expected. Ameren may also fail to achieve the anticipated
benefits of the acquisition as quickly or as cost- effectively as anticipated;
it may not be able to achieve those benefits at all. Ameren expects that this
acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in the first two years. This
expectation is based on important assumptions, which may be incorrect, including
assumptions related to expected financing arrangements, regulatory treatment,
interest rates, market prices for power, and synergies. As a result, if Ameren
is unable to integrate its businesses effectively or to achieve the benefits
anticipated, its results of operations, financial position, and liquidity may be
materially adversely affected.

The
electric and gas rates that certain Ameren Companies are allowed to charge in
Missouri and Illinois are largely set through 2006. These “rate freezes,” along
with other actions of regulators that can significantly affect our earnings,
liquidity, and business activities, are largely outside our
control.

The rates
that certain Ameren Companies are allowed to charge for their services are the
single most important item influencing the results of operations, financial
position, and liquidity of the Ameren Companies. Our industry is highly
regulated. The regulation of the rates that we charge our customers is
determined, in large part, by governmental organizations outside of our control,
including the MoPSC, the ICC, and the FERC. We are also subject to regulation by
the SEC under the PUHCA. Decisions made by these regulators could have a
material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and
liquidity.

As a part
of the settlement of UE’s Missouri electric rate case in 2002, UE is subject to
a rate moratorium that prohibits changes in its electric rates in Missouri
before July 1, 2006, subject to limited statutory and other exceptions. In
addition, a provision of the Illinois legislation related to the restructuring
of the Illinois electric industry put a rate freeze into effect in Illinois
until January 1, 2007, for UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. This Illinois
legislation also requires that 50% of the earnings from each respective Illinois
jurisdiction in excess of certain levels be refunded to UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and
IP’s Illinois customers through 2006. Furthermore, as part of the settlement of
UE’s Missouri gas rate case, which was approved by the MoPSC on January 13,
2004, UE agreed to a rate moratorium. It will make no changes in its gas
delivery rates prior to July 1, 2006, subject to certain exceptions. Also,
in the order approving Ameren’s acquisition of IP, the ICC prohibited IP from
filing for any proposed increase in gas delivery rates to be effective prior to
January 1, 2007, beyond IP’s pending request for a gas delivery rate increase.
The ICC conducted workshops seeking input from interested parties on the
framework to be used for retail rate determination and for generation
procurement by customers after the current Illinois rate freeze and supply
contracts end in 2006.

As a part
of the settlement of UE’s Missouri electric rate case in 2002, UE also undertook
to use commercially reasonable efforts to make critical energy infrastructure
investments of $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion from January 1, 2002 through
June 30, 2006, for among other things, the addition of more than 700
megawatts of new generation capacity. UE added 240 megawatts of CTs in 2002. UE
is also seeking to acquire 550 megawatts of CTs from Genco in 2005. Ameren also
committed IP to make between $275 million and $325 million in energy
infrastructure investments over its first two years of ownership, in conjunction
with the ICC’s approval of Ameren’s acquisition of IP. UE’s agreement to a rate
moratorium in Missouri and UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s rate freezes mean that
capital expenditures will not become recoverable in rates, and will not earn a
return, before July 1, 2006, for UE and January 1, 2007, for CIPS, CILCO and IP.
Therefore, undertakings with respect to energy infrastructure investments and
funding new programs, coupled with the rate reductions and rate moratoriums,
could result in increased financing requirements for UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP and
thus have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position,
and liquidity.


The
Ameren Companies do not have in either Missouri or Illinois a fuel adjustment
clause for their electric operations that would allow them to recover from
customers costs for purchased power or increased fuel used for generation.
Therefore, to the extent that we have not hedged our fuel and power costs, we
are exposed to changes in fuel and power prices to the extent that fuel for our
electric generating facilities and power must be purchased on the open market in
order for us to serve our customers.

Steps
taken and being considered at the federal and state levels continue to change
the structure of the electric industry and utility regulation. At the federal
level, the FERC has been mandating changes in the regulatory framework for
transmission-owning public utilities such as UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. In
Missouri, restructuring bills have been introduced in the past, but no
legislation has been passed. In Illinois, which since the acquisition of IP,
supplies over 50% of Ameren’s electric revenues, the Illinois Customer Choice
Law provides for electric utility restructuring and retail competition.

Principally
because of rate reductions and rate moratoriums that affect certain Ameren
Companies, increased costs and investments have resulted in decreased returns in
our distribution utility businesses. In 2005, Ameren will begin the process for
preparing and filing proposals for utility rate adjustments in Illinois and
Missouri to take effect after the expiration of the applicable rate
moratoriums.

We are
not able to predict what rate treatment certain Ameren Companies will receive
after the rate moratoriums expire in Missouri and Illinois. There are currently
activities under way in Illinois to determine the framework for retail electric
rate determination and generation procurement after the current Illinois
electric rate freeze and supply contracts expire in 2006. See Note 3 - Rate and
Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
report. In response to competitive, economic, political, legislative and
regulatory pressures, we may be subject to further rate moratoriums, rate
refunds, or rate reductions, any and all of which could have a significant
adverse affect on our results of operations, financial position, and
liquidity.

Increased
federal and state environmental regulation could require UE, Genco and CILCO to
incur large capital expenditures and increase operating
costs.

Approximately
65% of Ameren’s generating capacity is coal-fired. The balance is nuclear,
gas-fired, hydro, and oil-fired. The EPA issued proposed regulations with
respect to SO


,
NO

x

, and
mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. These new rules, if adopted,
would require significant additional reductions in these emissions from our
power plants in phases, beginning in 2010. The EPA has delayed finalization of
the proposed rules so that Congress may first consider the Bush Administration’s
Clear Skies legislation. The Clear Skies legislation calls for roughly 70% cuts
in NO

x

,
SO


, and
mercury emissions, phased in through 2018. Clear Skies legislation will probably
be introduced in the U.S. Congress and debated in 2005. Preliminary estimates of
capital costs, based on Ameren systems’ current technology, to comply with the
EPA proposed SO


,
NO

x

, and
mercury emission regulations, range from $1.4 billion to $1.9 billion by 2015.

Future
initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global warming continue to be
the subject of much debate. Coal-fired power plants are significant sources of
carbon dioxide emissions, a principal greenhouse gas. The related Kyoto Protocol
was signed by the United States, but it has since been rejected by the
president, who instead has asked for an 18% voluntary decrease in carbon
intensity. In response to the administration’s request, six electric power
sector trade associations, including the Edison Electric Institute, of which
Ameren is a member, and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the DOE in December 2004 calling for a 3%
- - 5% decrease in carbon intensity from

the
utility sector between 2002 and 2012 on a voluntary basis. Currently, Ameren is
considering various initiatives to comply with the MOU. These include enhanced
generation at our nuclear and hydro power plants, increased efficiency measures
at our coal-fired units, and investing in renewable energy and carbon
sequestration projects.

We are
unable to predict the ultimate effect of any new environmental regulations,
voluntary compliance guidelines, enforcement initiatives ,or legislation on our
results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Any of these factors
would add significant pollution control expenditures and operating costs to
UE’s, Genco’s and CILCO’s generating assets and, therefore, could also increase
financing requirements for some Ameren Companies. Although costs incurred by UE
would be eligible for recovery in rates over time, subject to the MoPSC or the
ICC approval in a rate proceeding, as applicable, there is no similar mechanism
for recovery of costs by Genco or CILCO in Illinois.

UE’s,
CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s participation in the MISO could increase costs, reduce
revenues, and reduce UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s control over their
transmission assets. Genco could also incur increased costs or reduced revenues
as a result of participation in the MISO Day Two Markets.

On May 1,
2004, functional control of the UE and CIPS transmission systems was transferred
to the MISO through GridAmerica LLC. On September 30, 2004, IP transferred
functional control of its transmission system to the MISO. CILCO had transferred
functional control of its transmission system to the MISO before the
acquisition. The participation by UE, CIPS and IP in the MISO is expected to
increase annual costs by $10 million to $25 million in the aggregate because the
companies will be subject to the MISO’s administrative costs. This could also
result in a decrease in annual revenues of $5 million to $15 million in the
aggregate,


because
of the MISO’s method of allocating transmission revenues. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP
may also be required to expand their

transmission
systems according to decisions made by MISO rather than according to their
internal planning process. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

In July
2002, the FERC issued its standard market design NOPR. The NOPR proposed three
important of changes to the way the current wholesale transmission service and
energy markets are operated: the placement of all jurisdictional transmission
facilities under the control of an independent transmission provider (similar to
the MISO); a new transmission service tariff that would provide a single form of
transmission service for all users of the transmission system, including bundled
retail load; and a new transmission management system. This new design would use
market-based pricing to compensate market participants for power, as well as for
transmission congestion and losses. The current system requires generators to
make advance reservations for transmission service.

In
April 2003, the FERC issued a white paper reflecting comments received in
response to the NOPR. The white paper indicated that the FERC will not assert
jurisdiction over the transmission rate component of bundled retail service. The
FERC will ensure in its final rule that existing bundled retail customers retain
their existing transmission rights and their rights for future load growth in
its final rule. Moreover, the white paper acknowledged that the final rule will
provide the states with input on resource adequacy requirements, allocation of
firm transmission rights, and transmission planning. The FERC also requested
input on the flexibility and timing of the final rule’s implementation. We
believe that the proposed NOPR could have a negative impact on the cost and
reliability of service to retail customers. It could lead to trapped
transmission costs that might not be recoverable from ratepayers as a result of
inconsistent regulatory policies.

Although
issuance of the final rule is uncertain and its implementation schedule unknown,
the MISO is implementing a separate market design similar to the market design
proposed by the NOPR. This new market design is referred to as the MISO Day Two
Market. The MISO Day Two Market, scheduled to begin operation on April 1, 2005,
is designed to result in improved transparency of power pricing and efficiency
in generation dispatch. Since this is a new and complex market, there could be
significant initial price volatility. Ultimately, price transparency and
dispatch efficiency could result in lower prices on market-based power sales by
UE, Genco, AERG and CILCO to their customers. In addition, the movement of power
could result in unanticipated transmission congestion charges or credits. MISO
has allocated FTRs to UE, CIPS, Genco, and CILCO. FTRs are financial instruments
that are intended to hedge this risk, but UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP may not
have been allocated the appropriate number of these FTRs. In addition, these
instruments could prove ineffective in hedging risk.

Until we
achieve some degree of operational experience participating in the MISO,
including the MISO Day Two Market, we are unable to predict the impact that the
MISO participation or ongoing RTO developments at the FERC or other regulatory
authorities will have on our results of operations, financial position, or
liquidity.

The
market-based rate authority currently held by UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO, AERG,
Development Company, Marketing Company, and Medina Valley could be revoked or
restricted as a result of the FERC’s new market power analysis screen order.

In an
order issued in April 2004, the FERC replaced the Supply Margin Assessment
Screen previously used to review applications by sellers of electricity at
wholesale for authorization to sell power at market-based rates. The new screen
uses two measures of market power: (1) a pivotal supplier analysis, and (2) a
market share analysis, which is to be prepared on a seasonal basis. Applicants
located in a RTO with sufficient market structure and a single energy market
were permitted to base their calculations of market power on the size of the
market in the geographic region under the control of the RTO, but other
applicants were required to base their calculations of market power on the size
of the market in the control area where they operate. If the applicant passes
both screens, a rebuttable presumption will exist that it lacks generation
market power. If the applicant fails either screen, a rebuttable presumption
will exist that it has market power. Under such circumstances, the applicant may
either seek to rebut the presumption by preparing a delivered price test
(identifying the amount of economic capacity from neighboring areas that can be
delivered to the control area) or propose mitigation measures. Unless some other
mitigation measure is adopted, the applicant’s authority to sell power at
market-based rates in areas where it has market power will be revoked, and the
applicant will be required to sell at cost-based rates in those
areas.

UE, CIPS,
Genco, CILCO, AERG, Development Company, Marketing Company, and Medina Valley
are currently authorized by the FERC to continue to sell power at market-based
rates. However, the FERC indicated in its April 2004 order that it would apply
the new market analysis screens to pending and future market-based rate
applications, including three-year market-based rate reviews. All of the
aforementioned Ameren entities currently have three-year market-based rate
reviews pending at the FERC.

As
required, these Ameren companies filed an updated market power analysis with the
FERC in December 2004. All of the Ameren companies pass both screen measures for
the market consisting of the entire MISO footprint. Also in their December
filings, these Ameren companies offered to supplement their filings with
information that applies the new


tests to
smaller markets consisting of the control areas in which the Ameren companies
sell power, if the MISO Day Two Markets does not begin on March 1, 2005, as
originally scheduled. In January 2005, the Missouri Joint Municipal Electric
Utility Commission (MJMEUC) filed a protest to the Ameren companies’ December
filing. In February 2005, the Ameren companies filed a response to the MJMEUC’s
protest, which rebutted its claims that the Ameren companies possess market
power.

We are
unable to anticipate how or when the FERC will respond to our December filings
and to any supplemental filings that we might make.

Increasing
costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans,
and other employee- related benefits may adversely affect our results of
operations, financial position, and liquidity.

We have
defined benefit and postretirement plans that cover substantially all of our
employees. Assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest
rates, and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our earnings
and funding requirements. Assuming that we continue to receive federal interest
rate relief beyond 2005, we do not expect contributions to our defined benefit
plans to be required until 2008 and 2009, when an aggregate $400 million is
expected to be paid. This amount is an estimate; it may change because of actual
stock market performance, changes in interest rates, or any pertinent changes in
government regulations, any of which could also result in a requirement to
record an additional minimum pension liability.

In
addition to the costs of our retirement plans, the costs of providing health
care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in
recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs
related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will
continue to rise. The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with
our defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans, and other employee
benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, or
liquidity.

UE’s,
Genco’s, CILCO’s, AERG’s, Medina Valley’s and EEI’s electric generating
facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled
plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses, and increased
purchased power costs.

UE,
Genco, CILCO, AERG, Medina Valley, and EEI own and operate coal, nuclear,
gas-fired, hydro, and oil-fired generating facilities. Operation of electric
generating facilities involves certain risks that can adversely affect energy
output

and
efficiency levels. Included among these risks are:

·

increased
      prices for fuel and fuel transportation as existing contracts
      expire;

·

facility
      shutdowns due to a failure of equipment or processes or operator
      error;

·

longer-than-anticipated
      maintenance outages;

·

disruptions
      in the delivery of fuel and lack of adequate
  inventories;

·

labor
      disputes;

·

inability
      to comply with regulatory or permit
requirements;

·

disruptions
      in the delivery of electricity;

·

increased
      capital expenditures requirements, including those due to environmental
      regulation; and

·

unusual
      or adverse weather conditions, including catastrophic events such as
      fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting electric
      generating facilities.

A
substantial portion of Genco’s and CILCO’s generating capacity is committed
under affiliate contracts that expire at the end of 2006. Upon expiration of
these contracts, Genco’s and CILCO’s electric generating facilities must compete
for the sale of energy and capacity, which exposes them to price
risk.

Genco and
CILCO, through AERG, own 4,751 megawatts and 1,165 megawatts, respectively, of
non-rate-regulated electric generating facilities. Of these non-rate-regulated
electric generating facilities, approximately 3,300 megawatts are currently
under full-requirements contracts with our affiliates. The remainder of the
generating capacity must compete for the sale of energy and capacity.

To the
extent electric capacity generated by these facilities is not under contract to
be sold, the revenues and results of operations of these non-rate-regulated
subsidiaries will generally depend on the prices that they can obtain for energy
and capacity in Illinois and adjacent markets.  Among the factors that
could influence such prices (all of which are beyond our control to a
significant degree) are:

·

the
      current and future market prices for natural gas, fuel oil, and
      coal;

·

current
      and forward prices for the sale of
electricity;

·

the
      extent of additional supplies of electric energy from current competitors
      or new market entrants;

·

the
      pace of deregulation in our market area and the expansion of deregulated
      markets;

·

the
      regulatory and pricing structures developed for Midwest energy markets as
      they continue to evolve and the pace of development of regional markets
      for energy and capacity outside of bilateral
contracts;

·

future
      pricing for, and availability of, transmission services on transmission
      systems, and the effect of RTOs and export energy transmission
      constraints, which could limit the ability to sell energy in markets
      adjacent to Illinois;


·

the
      rate of growth in electricity usage as a result of population changes,
      regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation
      programs; and

·

climate
      conditions prevailing in the Midwest
market.

In a
report issued by the ICC in late 2004, a process was outlined that would have
CIPS, CILCO and IP procuring power through an auction monitored by the ICC after
the current Illinois rate freeze and supply contracts end in 2006. Genco and
AERG would probably participate in this auction, but there might be a limit on
the maximum amount of power they could supply to Ameren’s Illinois utilities.
See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part
II, Item 8, of this report.

Genco and
UE have signed an agreement to dispatch their generating facilities jointly,
which produces benefits and efficiencies for both generating parties. Pending or
future federal and state regulatory proceedings and policies may evolve in ways
that could affect Genco’s ability to participate in these affiliate transactions
on current terms. For example, as a result of the MoPSC order approving the
transfer of UE’s Illinois-based utility business to CIPS, certain terms of the
joint dispatch agreement were ordered to be modified; this could result in
margins from interchange sales of $7 million to $24 million being transferred
from Genco to UE. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial
statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a more detailed description
of these modifications. The termination of the joint dispatch agreement, or
modifications to it, could have a material adverse effect on UE or Genco.

UE’s
ownership and operation of a nuclear generating facility creates business,
financial, and waste disposal risks.

UE owns
the Callaway nuclear plant, which represents approximately 14% of UE’s
generation capacity. Therefore, UE is subject to the risks of nuclear
generation, which include the following:

·

potential
      harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the
      operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of
      radioactive materials;

·

limitations
      on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover
      losses that might arise in connection with UE’s nuclear operations or
      those of others in the United States;

·

uncertainties
      with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts if insurance coverage
      is inadequate;

·

increased
      public and governmental concerns over the adequacy of security at nuclear
      power plants;

·

uncertainties
      with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning
      nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives (UE’s facility operating
      license for the Callaway nuclear plant expires in 2024); and

·

costly
      and extended outages for scheduled or unscheduled
    maintenance.

The NRC
has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety
requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of
non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down a unit, or
both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until
compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could
necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as UE’s. In
addition, although UE has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at
its plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm UE’s results of operations,
financial position, or liquidity. A major incident at a nuclear facility
anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or
licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.

Operating
performance at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant has resulted in unscheduled or
extended outages including the extension of Callaway’s scheduled refueling and
maintenance outage in 2004. In addition, Ameren and UE incurred significant
unanticipated replacement power and maintenance costs. As a result, the
operating performance at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant has declined in comparison
with both its past operating performance and the operating performance of other
nuclear plants in the U.S. Ameren and UE are actively working to address the
factors that led to the decline in Callaway’s operating performance. They are
reviewing management and supervision of operating personnel, equipment
reliability, maintenance worker practices, engineering performance, and overall
organizational effectiveness. However, Ameren and UE cannot predict whether such
efforts will result in an overall improvement of operations at Callaway. Any
actions taken are expected to result in incremental operating costs at Callaway.
Further, additional unscheduled or extended outages at Callaway could have a
material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and
liquidity of Ameren and UE.

Our
energy risk management strategies may not be effective in managing fuel and
electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities or
increased volatility in our earnings.

We are
exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity, and
emission credits. Prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity, and emission
credits may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and
expose us to commodity price risk. We use long-term purchase and sales contracts
in addition to derivatives such as forward contracts, futures contracts,
options, and swaps to manage these risks. We attempt to manage our risk
associated with these activities through enforcement of established risk limits
and risk management procedures. We cannot assure you that these strategies will
be successful in managing our pricing


risk,
or that they will not result in net liabilities to us as a result of future
volatility in these markets.

Although
we routinely enter into contracts to hedge our exposure to the risks of demand,
market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices, we do not always
hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility.
Furthermore, our ability to hedge our exposure to commodity price volatility
depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity
markets are illiquid, we may not be able to execute our risk management
strategies, which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would
prefer at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating
commodity prices can adversely affect our results of operations, financial
position, and liquidity.

Our
counterparties may not meet their obligations to us.

We are
exposed to risk that counterparties who owe us money, energy or other
commodities or services will not be able to perform their obligations. Should
the counterparties to these arrangements (which include agreements for a
subsidiary of Dynegy and others to supply electricity to IP during 2005 and
2006) fail to perform, IP might be forced to replace the underlying commitment
at then-current market prices. In such event, we might incur losses in addition
to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties.

Our
facilities are considered critical infrastructure and may be targets for acts of
terrorism.

Like
other electric and gas utilities, our power generation plants, fuel storage
facilities, and transmission and distribution facilities may be targets of
terrorist activities that could result in disruption of our ability to produce
or distribute some portion of our energy products. Any such disruption could
result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant additional costs to
repair, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial position, and liquidity.

Our
businesses are dependent on our ability to access the capital markets
successfully. We may not have access to sufficient capital in the amounts and at
the times needed.

We use
short-term and long-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity
and funding for capital requirements, including those related to future
environmental compliance, not satisfied by our operating cash flows. The
inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of
uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively impact our ability to
maintain and expand our businesses. Based on our current credit ratings, we
believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However,
events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets that
could increase our cost of capital or impair our ability to access the capital
markets.

ITEM
2. PROPERTIES.

For
information on our principal properties, including planned additions,
replacements and transfers, see the generating facilities table below and
Liquidity and Capital Resources and Regulatory Matters in Manage-ment’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under
Part II, Item 7, of this report. See also Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters,
Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings and Note 15 - Commitments and
Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

Ameren is
a member of MAIN, a regional electric reliability council organized to
coordinate the planning and operation of bulk power supply in Illinois and
portions of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri. The Ameren
membership covers UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. Ameren has provided formal written
notice to the MAIN board of directors of its intent to withdraw from MAIN
effective January 1, 2006, provided the configuration of MAIN remains the same.
Ameren intends to join another RRO prior to its withdrawal from MAIN. Ameren may
cancel its notice of intent to withdraw from MAIN at any time. Until the
withdrawal is effective, Ameren will continue to honor all of its obligations as
a member of MAIN. Before Ameren acquired it, IP gave notice to MAIN of its
intent to withdraw effective December 31, 2004. However, as a result of Ameren’s
acquisition of it, IP remains a member of MAIN through the Ameren membership.

The bulk
power system of UE, CIPS and Genco is operated as an Ameren-wide control area
and transmission system under the FERC-approved joint dispatch agreement. The
joint dispatch agreement provides a way for UE and Genco to participate in the
coordinated operation of CIPS’ and UE’s transmission facilities.
This allows UE and Genco to achieve economies consistent with the provision
of reliable electric service and an equitable sharing of the benefits and costs
of that coordinated operation. See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions to our
financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of
changes to the joint dispatch agreement that may arise out of a February 2005
MoPSC order. In 2004, we had a minimum of 18 direct connections with other
control areas for the exchange of electric energy, directly and through the
facilities of others. CILCO continues to operate as a separate control area, so
CILCO’s generating plants, including those of its subsidiary, AERG, have not
been jointly dispatched with the generating plants owned by UE and Genco. UE,
CIPS, CILCO and IP are transmission-owning members of the MISO, and they have
transferred functional control of their systems to the MISO. Transmission
service on the UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP transmission systems are provided pursuant
to the terms of the MISO OATT on file with the FERC. See Note 3 - Rate and
Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
report for further information.

Long-term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under
      Part II, Item 8, of this report.

(d)

CT
      has the capability of operating on either oil or natural gas (dual
      fuel).

(e)

Represents
      CTs to be added in 2005.

(f)

Approximately
      550 megawatts of generating capacity (Pinckneyville and Kinmundy) are
      expected to be sold by Genco to UE subject to receipt of necessary
      regulatory approvals.

(g)

This
      amount represents Ameren’s 80% interest in EEI. See Note 1 - Summary of
      Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II,
      Item 8, of this report.

(h)

There
      is a tolling agreement in place for one of Elgin’s units (approximately
      100 megawatts).

(i)

These
      CTs are owned by Genco and leased to its parent, Development Company. The
      operating lease is for a minimum term of 15 years expiring September 30,
      2015. Genco receives rental payments under the lease in fixed monthly
      amounts that vary over the term of the lease and range from $0.8 million
      to $1.0 million.

(j)

Genco
      has granted the city of Columbia, Missouri options to purchase an
      undivided ownership interest in these facilities, which would result in a
      sale of up to 72 megawatts (about 50%) of the facilities. Columbia can
      exercise one option for 36 megawatts at the end of 2010 for a purchase
      price of $15.5 million, at the end of 2014 for a purchase price of $9.5
      million, or at the end of 2020 for a purchase price of $4 million. The
      other option can be exercised for another 36 megawatts at the end of 2013
      for a purchase price of $15.5 million, at the end of 2017 for a purchase
      price of $9.5 million, or at the end of 2023 for a purchase price of $4
      million. A power purchase agreement pursuant to which Columbia is now
      purchasing up to 72 megawatts of capacity and energy generated by these
      facilities from Marketing Company will terminate if the city exercises the
      purchase options.

(k)

These
      facilities were contributed by CILCO to AERG in October 2003. See Note 1 -
      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements
      under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

As of
December 31, 2004, UE owned 3,200 circuit miles of electric transmission lines
and operated two propane-air plants and 3,050 miles of natural gas transmission
and distribution mains. As of December 31, 2004, CIPS owned 1,900 circuit miles
of electric transmission lines and operated one propane-air plant, three
underground gas storage fields with a total working capacity of 3 billion cubic
feet, and 5,000 miles of natural gas transmission and distribution mains. As of
December 31, 2004, CILCO owned 350 circuit miles of electric transmission lines.
CILCO operates two underground gas storage fields with a total working capacity
of 6 billion cubic


feet and
3,800 miles of gas transmission and distribution mains. As of December 31, 2004,
IP owned 1,700 circuit miles of electric transmission lines. IP owns seven
underground gas storage fields with a total working capacity of 15 billion cubic
feet and 8,500 miles of natural gas transmission and distribution mains. Our
other properties include distribution lines, under-ground cables, office
buildings, warehouses, garages, and repair shops.

We have
fee title to all principal plants and other units of property material to the
operation of our businesses, and to the real property on which such facilities
are located (subject to mortgage liens securing our outstanding first mortgage
bond indebtedness and to certain permitted liens and judgment liens), except
that:

·

A
      portion of UE’s Osage plant reservoir, certain facilities at UE’s Sioux
      plant, most of UE’s Peno Creek CT facility, Genco’s Columbia CT facility,
      certain of Ameren’s substations and most of our transmission and
      distribution lines and gas mains are situated on lands we occupy under
      leases, easements, franchises, licenses or
permits;

·

The
      United States or the state of Missouri may own or may have paramount
      rights to certain lands lying in the bed of the Osage River or located
      between the inner and outer harbor lines of the Mississippi River, on
      which certain of UE’s generating and other properties are located; and

·

The
      United States, the state of Illinois, the state of Iowa or the city of
      Keokuk, Iowa, may own or may have paramount rights with respect to certain
      lands lying in the bed of the Mississippi River on which a portion of UE’s
      Keokuk plant is located.

Substantially
all of the properties and plant of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are subject to the
direct first liens of the indentures securing their mortgage bonds. In October
2003, CILCO transferred substantially all of its generating property and plant
to its non-rate-regulated electric generating subsidiary, AERG. As part of the
transfer, CILCO’s transferred generating property and plant was released from
the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. During 2005, UE
plans to transfer its Illinois electric and gas transmission and distribution
properties to CIPS, depending on the outcome of pending regulatory proceedings.
See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part
II, Item 8, of this report for further information. As a part of the transfer,
UE’s Illinois electric and gas transmission and distribution properties will be
released from the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds and
will become encumbered by the direct first lien of the indenture securing the
CIPS first mortgage bonds.

In
December 2002, UE conveyed most of its Peno Creek CT facility to the city of
Bowling Green, Missouri, and leased the facility back from the city for a
20-year term. As a part of the transaction, most of UE’s Peno Creek property and
plant was released from the lien of the indenture securing UE’s first mortgage
bonds. Under the terms of this capital lease, UE retains all operation and
maintenance responsibilities for the facility, and ownership of the facility
will return to UE at the expiration of the lease. When ownership of the Peno
Creek facility is returned to UE by Bowling Green, the property and plant may
again become encumbered by the direct first lien of any outstanding UE first
mortgage bond indenture.

ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

We are
involved in legal and administrative proceedings before various courts and
agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business,
some of which involve sub-stantial amounts of money. We believe that the final
disposition of these proceedings, except as otherwise disclosed in this report,
will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position or liquidity. Risk of loss is mitigated, in some cases, by insurance or
contractual or statutory indemnification. We believe that we have established
appropriate reserves for potential losses.

For
additional information on legal and administrative proceedings, see Rates and
Regulation under Item 1. Business above, Liquidity and Capital Resources and
Regulatory Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report , Note
3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters, and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to
our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

Ameren
Executive Summary

Overview

The most
significant event for Ameren in 2004 was the announcement, financing and
September 30th completion of the $2.3 billion acquisition of IP and an
additional 20% ownership interest in EEI.

In 2004,
Ameren recorded solid net earnings of $2.84 per share due to weather-adjusted
demand growth, the incremental earnings contribution resulting from the
acquisitions of IP on September 30, 2004, and CILCORP Inc. on January 31, 2003,
and increased earnings from our excess power sales. This earnings performance
was accomplished despite very mild summer weather, a planned refueling and
maintenance outage at our Callaway nuclear plant and the early issuance of
common shares to fund the IP acquisition. Earnings in 2003 included unusual
gains of 30 cents per share related to the adoption of an accounting standard
and settlement of a dispute with a coal supplier, and there was no Callaway
outage required in 2003.

Earnings

Total
revenues in 2004 increased 12% to $5.2 billion from 2003. Growth in revenues was
generated by the acquisitions of IP and CILCORP, which added $484 million in
revenues in 2004. In addition, revenues benefited from weather-adjusted growth,
increased excess power sales due to greater availability of low-cost generation
and improved power prices, and higher natural gas delivery rates.

During
2004, factors that mitigated this improvement in revenues included extremely
mild summer weather and the final $30 million annual rate reduction under the
electric rate case settlement in Missouri that went into effect on April 1,
2004. Summer weather in 2004 in our service territory was the seventh mildest of
the past 109 years, according to the National Weather service. Mild 2004 weather
reduced revenues by an estimated $38 million in 2004, relative to
2003.

Operations
and maintenance expenses increased 9% to $1.3 billion in 2004 from 2003, again,
primarily because of the acquisitions. Expenses were also higher because of the
two-month refueling and maintenance outage at our Callaway nuclear plant, which
increased expenses by $39 million, and purchased power costs by $24 million. A
70-day to 75-day outage is scheduled for 2005 in order to replace major
equipment that is expected to increase the generating capacity of the Callaway
plant by over 50 megawatts and improve future safety and reliability. Employee
benefit costs also increased in 2004 as compared with 2003.

Operations
expenses benefited from the $18 million refund of exit fees paid to the MISO
upon re-entry to that system in 2004 and lower labor costs.

Liquidity

Cash
flows from operations of $1.1 billion in 2004 at Ameren, along with other funds,
were used to pay dividends to common shareholders of $479 million and fund
capital expenditures of $806 million. Cash flows from operations were reduced by
a $295 million contribution to our pension plan.

Ameren
issued approximately 30 million shares of common stock in 2004 to finance the
acquisition of Illinois Power and an additional 20% interest in EEI. Net
proceeds of $1.3 billion were used to pay the cash portion of the purchase price
of $443 million, and reduce high-cost debt and pay related fees at IP. Other
financing activities primarily related to refinancing higher cost or maturing
debt in Ameren’s other subsidiaries.


Outlook

We expect
continued economic growth in our service territory to benefit electric demand in
2005 with natural gas and coal prices supporting power prices similar to 2004
levels. Ameren’s coal and related transportation costs rose in 2004

and are
expected to rise 3% to 4% in 2005 and 2006. These costs are expected to increase
more beyond 2006 as existing contracts are replaced. We also expect to realize
synergies from the IP acquisition in 2005 and 2006.

Electric
rates for Ameren’s operating subsidiaries have been fixed or declining for
periods ranging from 12 years to 22 years. In addition, power supplied by
Ameren’s non-rate-regulated generation subsidiaries has been subject to
contracts to supply our Illinois distribution subsidiaries. In 2006, electric
rate adjustment moratoriums and intercompany power supply contracts expire in
Ameren’s regulatory jurisdictions. We believe that the prices reflected in these
power supply contracts are below current market prices. In 2005, we will begin
the process of preparing and filing utility cost-of-service studies and filing a
proposed framework for power procurement that will determine electric rates in
2006 and beyond.

The EPA
has proposed more stringent emission limits on all coal-fired power plants.
Between 2005 and 2015, Ameren expects its subsidiaries will be required to spend
between $1.4 and $1.9 billion to retrofit its power plants with pollution
control equipment. Approximately two-thirds of this investment will be in the
Company’s regulated Missouri operations and therefore is expected to be
recoverable over time from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts invested in
non-rate-regulated operations will depend on whether market prices for power
adjust for this increased investment by the industry.

General

Ameren,
headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company
registered with the SEC under the PUHCA. Ameren’s primary asset is the common
stock of its subsidiaries. Ameren’s subsidiaries operate rate-regulated electric
generation, transmission and distribution businesses, rate-regulated natural gas
distribution businesses and non-rate-regulated electric generation businesses in
Missouri and Illinois as discussed below. Dividends on Ameren’s common stock are
dependent on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. See Note 1 -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under
Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed description of our principal
subsidiaries.

·

UE
      operates a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission and
      distribution business, and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution
      business in Missouri and Illinois.

·

CIPS
      operates a rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and
      distribution business in Illinois.

·

Genco
      operates a non-rate-regulated electric generation business.

·

CILCO
      is a subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company) and operates a
      rate-regulated electric transmission and distribution business, a
      primarily non-rate-regulated electric generation business, through its
      subsidiary, AERG, and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution business
      in Illinois.

·

IP
      operates a rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and
      distribution business in Illinois. See Note 2 - Acquisitions to our
      financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further
      information.

The
financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and
therefore include the accounts of its majority-owned subsidiaries. As the
acquisition of IP occurred on September 30, 2004, Ameren’s Consolidated
Statements of Income and Cash Flows for the periods prior to September 30, 2004,
and Ameren’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003, do not reflect
IP’s results of operations or financial position. Financial information of
CILCORP and CILCO reflected in Ameren’s consolidated financial statements
include the period from January 31, 2003, when these companies were acquired.
See Note 2 - Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
this report for further information on the accounting for the IP and CILCORP
acquisitions. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, unless otherwise
indicated.

In
addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total,
certain information is expressed in cents per share. These amounts reflect
factors that directly affect Ameren’s earnings. We believe this per share
information is useful because it enables readers to understand the impact of
these factors on Ameren’s earnings per share. All references in this report to
earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares outstanding during
the applicable year.

IP
Acquisition

On
September 30, 2004, Ameren completed the acquisition from Dynegy of all the
common stock and 662,924 shares of preferred stock of IP (based in Decatur,
Illinois) and an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI and its subsidiaries.
Ameren acquired IP to complement its existing Illinois electric and gas
operations. The purchase included IP’s rate-regulated electric and natural gas
transmission and distribution business serving approximately 600,000 electric
and 415,000 gas customers in

areas
contiguous to our existing Illinois utility service territories. With the
acquisition, IP became an Ameren subsidiary operating as AmerenIP.

For a
discussion of the regulatory agency approvals granted in connection with this
acquisition, see Note 3 - Rate

and
Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
report.


The total
transaction value was $2.3 billion. It included the assumption of $1.8 billion
of IP debt and preferred stock and consideration, including transaction costs,
of $443 million cash, net of $51 million cash acquired. In February 2005, Ameren
received $5 million from Dynegy as a final working capital settlement. Ameren
placed $100 million of the cash portion of the purchase price in a six-year
escrow account, pending resolution of certain contingent environmental
obligations of IP and other Dynegy affiliates for which Ameren has been provided
indemnification by Dynegy. See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our
financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on
the IP environmental matter to which the indemnification and escrow applies. In
addition, this transaction included a fixed-price power supply agreement for
IP’s annual purchase in 2005 and 2006 of 2,800 megawatts of electricity from
DYPM. The contract was marked to fair value at closing of the IP acquisition.
This agreement is expected to supply about 70% of IP’s electric customer
requirements during those two years. The remaining 30% of its power needs in
2005 and 2006 will be supplied under other arrangements. In the event that any
of IP’s suppliers are unable to supply the electricity required by existing
agreements, IP would be forced to find alternative suppliers to meet its load
requirements, thus exposing IP to market price risk, which could have a material
impact on Ameren’s and IP’s results of operations, financial condition, or
liquidity.

Ameren’s
financing plan for funding this acquisition included the issuance of new Ameren
common stock. Ameren issued an aggregate of approximately 30 million common
shares in February 2004 and July 2004, which generated net proceeds of about
$1.3 billion. Proceeds from these issuances were used to finance the cash
portion of the purchase price and to reduce high-cost IP debt assumed as part of
this transaction and to pay related premiums. See Note 6 - Long-term Debt and
Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
report for information on redemptions and repurchases of certain IP indebtedness
after the acquisition.

Ameren
expects the acquisition of IP to be accretive to earnings in the first two years
of ownership. That belief is based on a variety of assumptions related to power
prices, interest rates, and synergies, among other things. In December 2004, 230
IP employees accepted a voluntary separation opportunity, which

provides
an enhanced separation benefit and extended medical and dental benefits.
Employees who accepted the voluntary separation opportunity will leave IP
throughout 2005 as business needs warrant. These voluntary separations are
consistent with Ameren’s plan for the integration of IP and conditions in the
ICC order approving the acquisition, which relate to the realization of
administrative synergies from the acquisition. Estimated separation costs of $26
million have been deferred as a regulatory asset of future recovery from
customers, which is also consistent with the ICC order.

For
income tax purposes, Ameren and Dynegy have elected to treat Ameren’s
acquisition of IP stock as an asset acquisition under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

Earnings
Summary

Our
results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors.
Weather, economic conditions, and the actions of key customers or competitors
can significantly affect the demand for our services. Our results are also
affected by seasonal fluctuations caused by winter heating and summer cooling
demand. With approximately 85% of Ameren’s revenues directly subject to
regulation by various state and federal agencies, decisions by regulators can
have a material impact on the price we charge for our services. Our
non-rate-regulated sales are subject to market conditions for power. We
principally use coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil in our operations. The
prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the world
economic and political environment, weather, supply and demand levels and many
other factors. We do not

have fuel
or purchased power cost recovery mechanisms in Missouri or Illinois for our
electric utility businesses, but

we do
have gas cost recovery mechanisms in each state for our gas delivery businesses.
The electric and gas rates for UE in Missouri are set through June 2006, and are
set for CIPS, CILCO and IP in Illinois through the end of 2006, so that cost
decreases or increases will not be immediately reflected in rates. Fluctuations
in interest rates affect our cost of borrowing and pension and postretirement
benefits. We employ various risk management strategies in order to try to reduce
our exposure to commodity risks and other risks inherent in our business. The
reliability of our power plants and transmission and distribution systems and
the level of purchased power costs, operating and administrative costs, and
capital investment are key factors that we seek to control in order to optimize
our results of operations

,
financial position,

and
liquidity.

Ameren’s
net income for 2004, 2003, and 2002, was $530 million ($2.84 per share), $524
million ($3.25 per share), and $382 million ($2.60 per share), respectively. In
2003, Ameren’s net income included an after-tax gain of $31 million (19 cents
per share) related to the settlement of a dispute over mine reclamation issues
with a coal supplier and a net cumulative effect after-tax gain of $18 million
(11 cents per share) associated with

the
adoption of SFAS No. 143, “

Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations.” The coal contract settlement gain recaptured
coal costs, plus accrued interest, previously paid to a coal supplier for

future
reclamation of a coal mine that principally supplied a UE power plant. The SFAS
No. 143 net gain resulted principally from the elimination from accumulated
deprecation of accrued costs of removal for non-rate-regulated assets; these
accrued costs of removal were not legal obligations.


The
following table presents net cumulative effect after-tax gains (losses) recorded
upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 in 2003:

predecessor information.

In 2002,
Ameren’s net income included after-tax restructuring charges of $58 million (40
cents per share) for a voluntary employee retirement program; the retirement of
some facilities at UE’s Venice, Illinois power plant; and the temporary
suspension of operation of two coal-fired generating units at Genco’s Meredosia,
Illinois power plant. See Note 7 - Restructuring Charges and Other Special Items
to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further
information.

The
following table presents a reconciliation of Ameren’s net income to net income,
excluding restructuring charges and other special items discussed above, as
well as the effect of SFAS No. 143 adoption, all net of taxes, for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Ameren believes that this reconciliation
presents results from continuing operations on a more comparable basis. However,
net income, or earnings per share, excluding these items is not a presentation
defined under GAAP, and it may not be comparable to other companies’
presentations or more useful than the GAAP presentation included in Ameren’s
financial statements.

Excluding
the gains on the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the settlement of the coal mine
reclamation dispute in the prior year, Ameren’s net income increased $55
million, and earnings per share decreased 11 cents, in 2004 as compared with
2003. The change in net income was primarily due to organic growth in revenues;
increased margins on interchange sales, primarily due to greater availability of
low-cost generation (16 cents per share); gas delivery rate increases (10 cents
per share); lower labor costs (8 cents per share); the MISO refund of previously
paid exit fees upon UE’s and CIPS’ re-entry into the MISO in the second quarter
of 2004 (6 cents per share); and results of CILCORP’s inclusion for an
additional month and IP’s inclusion for three months in 2004. Partially
offsetting these increases to income were increased fuel and purchased power
costs and other operations and maintenance costs as a result of UE’s Callaway
nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in the second quarter of 2004 (22
cents per share), extremely mild 2004 weather conditions (estimated at 12 to 16
cents per share), electric rate reductions (13 cents per share), and higher
employee benefit costs (11 cents per share). Increased common shares outstanding
also reduced Ameren’s earnings per share in 2004 as compared with
2003.

Excluding
the gains related to the coal mine reclamation settlement and an accounting
change in 2003 and the restructuring loss in 2002, Ameren’s net income in 2003
increased $35 million, and earnings per share decreased 5 cents as compared to
2002. The change in net income was primarily due to the acquisition of CILCORP;
favorable margins on interchange sales (35 cents per share), due to improved
power prices in the energy markets and greater low-cost generation available for
sale

; organic
growth;

lower
labor costs due to the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in
early 2003 (11 cents per share); lower maintenance expenses in Ameren’s
pre-CILCORP acquisition operations (25 cents per share); and a decrease in Other
Miscellaneous Expense as a result of the expensing of economic development and
energy assistance programs in the second quarter of 2002 related to the UE
Missouri electric rate case settlement. These benefits to Ameren’s 2003 net
income were partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions (estimated at 40
to 50 cents per share), primarily due to cooler summer weather in Ameren’s
pre-CILCORP territory than the normal conditions experienced in 2002; an
electric rate reduction in UE’s Missouri service territory that went into effect
in April 2003 (11 cents per share);

lower
sales of emission credits (7 cents per share); and higher employee benefit costs
(8 cents per share). Increased common shares outstanding


also
reduced Ameren’s earnings per share in 2003 as compared with 2002.

As a
holding company, Ameren’s net income and cash flows are primarily generated by
its principal subsidiaries: UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP. The following table
presents the contribution by Ameren’s principal subsidiaries to Ameren’s
consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and

Acquisition
Accounting

The
amortization of noncash purchase accounting fair value adjustments at IP
increased Ameren’s and IP’s net income by $26 million for the three months ended
December 31, 2004, as compared with the prior-year period. The amortization of
the fair value adjustments at IP that increased net income were related to
pension and postretirement liabilities, long-term debt, a power supply contract
with EEI that expires in 2005, and a power supply contract with Dynegy for 2,800
megawatts that expired in 2004. Partially offsetting these items was the
amortization of the fair value adjustment related to a power supply contract for
700 megawatts that also expired in 2004. Concurrent with its acquisition of IP,
Ameren negotiated a contract with Dynegy to supply IP 2,800 megawatts for 2005
and 2006. The fair value adjustments associated with this agreement and the EEI
contract noted above will be amortized over the terms of the contracts and will
have a net favorable impact on IP’s net income. The following table presents the
favorable (unfavorable) impact on IP’s net income related to the amortization of
purchase

      effect of the above amortization adjustments.

The

related to the additional 20% interest acquired by Ameren on September 30, 2004,
for plant in service, emission credits and a power supply agreement with IP that
expires in 2005. The amortization of the fair value adjustment of the power
supply agreement of $3 million in 2004 between IP and EEI had no affect on net
income at a consolidated Ameren level because IP is amortizing its fair value
adjustment for the same power supply agreement. The following table presents the

Electric
Operations

The
following tables present the favorable (unfavorable) variations in electric
margins, defined as electric revenues

less fuel
and purchased power costs,  from prior  year for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003. We consider electric and interchange margins useful
measures to analyze the change in profitability of our electric operations
between periods. We have included the analysis below as a complement to our
financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, electric and
interchange margins may not be a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be
comparable to other companies’ presentations or more useful than the GAAP
information we are providing elsewhere in this report.

The
variation for Ameren shows the contribution from IP for the last three months of
2004 and the contribution from CILCORP for January 2004 as separate line items,
which allows an easier comparison with other margin components. The variation in
IP electric margins in 2004 include the purchase accounting adjustments
discussed above; they are compared with the full years 2003 and 2002, when
Ameren did not own IP and it did not contribute to Ameren’s electric margins.
The variations in CILCORP and CILCO electric margins in 2004 and 2003 are
compared with the full years 2003 and 2002. Before January 31, 2003, Ameren did
not own CILCORP and CILCO and they did not contribute to Ameren’s electric
margins.

Ameren

versus 2003

Ameren’s
electric margin increased $128 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. Excluding
the additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in the
current year, electric margin increased $4 million for 2004. Strong organic
growth due to improved economic conditions and increased margins on interchange
sales more than offset the effect of unfavorable weather conditions, increased
fuel and purchased power costs due to the second quarter 2004 Callaway nuclear
plant refueling and maintenance outage, and rate reductions in the current year
as compared with the prior year. In addition, revenues from emission credit
sales decreased $7 million in 2004 as compared with 2003.

According
to the National Weather Service, summer weather in 2004 in Ameren’s service
territory was the seventh mildest in the past 109 years. Cooling degree-days
during that period in our service territory were down approximately 20% from
both normal conditions and the prior year. Warmer winter weather in 2004 also
resulted in heating degree-days that were down approximately 7% in 2004 in our
service territory as compared with 2003, and down approximately 10% from normal
conditions. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP sales and three months of
IP sales in the current year, residential sales were flat compared to the prior
year, as organic growth offset the impact of the unfavorable weather conditions.
Commercial and industrial sales increased 2% in 2004 due to improved economic
conditions.

Rate
reductions resulting from the 2002 UE electric rate case settlement in Missouri
negatively affected electric revenues during 2004. Annual reductions of $50
million, $30 million, and $30 million were effective April 1, 2002, 2003, and
2004, respectively.

Margins
on interchange sales increased $37 million in 2004 as compared with the same
period in 2003, because of increased availability of low-cost generation
resulting from record power generation and reduced demand from native load
customers due to the mild summer weather. In addition to increased availability
of low-cost power, the current year also benefited because both higher natural
gas and coal prices contributed to increased power prices. Average realized
power prices on interchange sales increased to approximately $34 per
megawatthour in 2004 from approximately $32 per megawatthour in 2003. In 2004,
Ameren’s base load coal-fired electric generating plants’ average capacity
factor was approximately 76%, despite the extremely mild weather, as compared
with 73% in 2003, and the equivalent availability factor was approximately 87%,
as compared with 85% in the prior-year period.

EEI’s
revenues decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 because of reduced emission credit
sales and decreased sales to the DOE, which also resulted in a decrease in
purchased power. EEI’s sales of emission credits were $2 million in 2004 as
compared with $10 million in 2003.

Ameren’s
fuel and purchased power costs increased $54 million, excluding the additional
month of CILCORP and the additional three months of IP in the current year, as
compared with 2003, because of increased power purchases necessitated by the
Callaway refueling and maintenance outage as well as increased fossil generation
and fuel prices.

versus 2002

Ameren’s
electric margin increased $187 million in

2003 as
compared with 2002. Increases in electric margin in 2003 were attributable
primarily to the acquisition of CILCORP, increased margins on interchanges
sales, and organic sales growth, partially offset by unfavorable weather
conditions relative to 2002, lower sales of emission credits, and rate
reductions. CILCORP’s contribution to Ameren’s electric margin for the 11 months
ended December 31, 2003, was $236 million. Margins on interchange sales
increased $92 million in 2003 because of improved power prices in the energy
markets and increased low-cost generation availability. Average realized power
prices on interchange sales increased to approximately $32 per megawatthour in
2003 from approximately $25 per megawatthour in 2002. Availability of coal-fired
generating plants increased to 85% in 2003 from 82% in 2002 because there were
fewer scheduled and


unscheduled outages. In addition, there was no refueling
outage at our Callaway nuclear plant in 2003.

The
unfavorable weather conditions were the cooler summer weather in 2003 versus
warmer than normal conditions in the same periods in 2002. Cooling degree-days
were down approximately 25% in 2003 in our service territory compared with 2002
and down approximately 10% from normal conditions. Heating degree-days in 2003
were comparable to 2002 and normal conditions. In Ameren’s pre-CILCORP
acquisition service territory, weather-sensitive residential and commercial
electric kilowatthour sales declined 4% and 2%, respectively, in 2003 compared
with 2002. Industrial electric kilowatthour sales increased 2% in 2003 in
Ameren’s pre-CILCORP acquisition service territory because of improving economic
conditions.

Annual
rate reductions of $50 million and $30 million were effective April 1, 2002 and
2003, respectively, as a result of the 2002 UE electric rate case settlement in
Missouri. Those reductions negatively affected electric revenues in 2003 and
2002.

EEI’s
revenues decreased in 2003 as compared with 2002 because of lower emission
credit sales and decreased sales to the DOE, which also resulted in a decrease
in fuel and purchased power. EEI’s sales of emission credits were $10 million in
2003 as compared with $38 million in 2002.

Ameren’s
fuel and purchased power increased in 2003 compared with 2002 because of
increased kilowatthour sales, related primarily to the addition of CILCORP.
Excluding CILCORP, fuel and purchased power decreased in 2003 primarily because
of the greater availability of low-cost generation.

UE

UE’s
electric margin decreased $15 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. Residential
sales were comparable with prior-year sales as the effect of mild summer weather
was offset by organic growth. Rate reductions from the 2002 rate case settlement
negatively affected electric revenues during 2004. Partially offsetting these
decreases to electric revenues were increased interchange margins and higher
emission sales. Margins on interchange sales increased $23 million in 2004 as
compared to 2003, because of increased availability of low-cost generation and
higher power prices. Revenues from emission credit sales decreased $3 million in
the current year as compared with 2003. Fuel and purchased power increased $20
million in 2004, primarily because of increased purchased power of $24 million
resulting from the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage during the second
quarter of 2004, partially offset by decreased demand due to mild summer weather
conditions in 2004.

UE’s
electric margin decreased $22 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. Decreases
in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to the unfavorable
weather conditions and the rate reductions resulting from the 2002 Missouri
electric rate case settlement mentioned above. However, margins on interchange
sales increased $64 million because of improved power prices in the energy
markets and increased low-cost generation availability. Fuel and purchased power
decreased slightly in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of lower
transmission costs.

CIPS

CIPS’
2004 electric margin was comparable with the margin in 2003. Electric margin was
favorably affected by an industrial customer’s switching from CIPS to Marketing
Company and the elimination of the negative margin associated with this
customer. Unfavorable weather conditions offset the above increases to margin.

CIPS’
electric margin decreased $27 million in 2003, as compared with 2002, primarily
because of the unfavorable weather conditions and several customers’ switching
from CIPS to Marketing Company. Commencing in 2002, all of CIPS’, CILCO’s, IP’s
and UE’s Illinois residential, commercial and industrial customers had a choice
in electric suppliers according to the Illinois Customer Choice Law. CIPS
continues to provide electric delivery service to these customers, and it
charges them ICC-approved delivery service tariff rates for that service.
Customer switching resulted in a $95 million decline in CIPS revenues which is
included in the line item growth and other in the table above, offset by a
related decrease of $85 million in purchased power for 2003.

Genco

Genco’s
electric margin increased $61 million in 2004, as compared with 2003. The
increase in electric margin was primarily attributable to an increase in
wholesale and retail margins due to sales to new customers and increased
availability of lower-cost generation. Interchange margins increased $14 million
in 2004, as compared with 2003 because power prices were higher and more
low-cost power was available for sale due to the mild
weather.

Genco’s
electric margin increased $43 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. Increases
in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to increased margins on
interchange sales. Interchange margins on interchange sales increased $33
million in 2003 because of improved power prices in the energy markets. Fuel and
purchased power increased $2 million in 2003 because of higher purchased power
costs associated with higher energy prices and lower generation availability.
These increased costs were partially offset by lower generation costs due to a
12% decline in megawatthour generation. The decline in generation during 2003
was primarily attributable to the timing of outages at Genco’s power plants and
unexpected downtime and unfavorable margins associated with Genco’s CTs.


CILCORP
and CILCO

Electric
margin decreased $14 million at CILCORP and $7 million at CILCO in 2004 as
compared with 2003. Decreases in electric margin were primarily attributable to
reduced revenues due to two large CILCO industrial customers switching to
Marketing Company in July and October 2003 and transfers of other
non-rate-regulated customers to Marketing Company ($168 million). Fuel and
purchased power also decreased because several customers switched to Marketing
Company.

CILCORP’s
electric margin decreased $13 million and CILCO’s electric margin decreased $14
million in 2003 as compared with 2002. Decreases in electric margin in 2003 were
primarily attributable to lower margin per megawatthour sold on a
non-rate-regulated basis to electric customers outside CILCO’s service
territory, the switch of the two large CILCO customers to Marketing Company
discussed above, and unfavorable weather conditions. In addition, fuel and
purchased power at CILCORP increased as compared with CILCO, because of the net
effect of purchase accounting fair value adjustments related to emission
allowances, partially offset by those associated with coal contracts.

IP

IP’s
electric margin increased $16 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. The
increase in electric margin was principally due to lower purchased power costs
as a result of purchase accounting adjustments ($26 million). Revenues were
reduced because of unfavorable summer weather. Electric margin was also
unfavorably affected by industrial customers who chose alternative
suppliers.

The
decrease in electric margin of $47 million in 2003 as compared with 2002
reflected lower residential and commercial sales volume due to cooler summer
weather, the full-year impact of the 5% residential rate decrease that was
effective May 1, 2002; and lower industrial sales due to the combined effect of
customers who chose alternative suppliers and general economic conditions.
Electricity purchases increased in 2003 as compared with 2002. A higher average
cost per unit was offset by lower purchased volumes due to the cooler weather
and economic conditions. Decreased interchange revenues in 2003 resulted from
the favorable reversal of previously recorded litigation reserves with an
interchange customer in 2002.

Gas
Operations

The
following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) variations in gas margins,
defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale, as compared with the
prior periods for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. We consider gas
margin to be a useful measure to analyze the change in profitability of our gas
utility operations between periods. We have included the table below as a
complement to our financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.
However, gas margin may not be a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be

Gas
margins at Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO increased in 2004 primarily
because of delivery rate increases, partially offset by milder winter weather
conditions. Ameren’s gas margin also increased $13 million because of the
additional month of CILCORP results and $40 million because of the three months
of IP results in 2004. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP and the three
months of IP in 2004, Ameren’s sales were down 5% as a result of the mild winter
weather conditions. IP’s gas margin decreased $4 million in 2004 as compared
with 2003, primarily because of milder winter weather in 2004.

Ameren’s
gas margin increased in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of $73
million added by the acquisition of CILCORP. The gas margins at UE, CIPS,
CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 were comparable to 2002 as heating degree-days were
consistent with 2002. Gas margin at IP was higher in 2003 as compared with 2002
because of colder weather in the first quarter of 2003 in IP’s service
territory.

Operating
Expenses and Other Statement of Income Items

Other
Operations and Maintenance

Ameren

Ameren’s
other operations and maintenance expenses increased $113 million in 2004 as
compared with 2003. The additional month of CILCORP results and three months of
IP results in the current year accounted for $15 million and $43 million,
respectively, of other operations and maintenance expense in 2004 as compared
with 2003. Additionally, expenses at Ameren increased $55 million in 2004,
primarily because of increased maintenance expenses stemming from


the
refueling and maintenance outage at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant during the
second quarter of 2004. The outage lasted 64 days and resulted in incremental
maintenance costs of $39 million. Refueling and maintenance outages occur
approximately every 18 months. They typically include the replacement of fuel
and the performance of maintenance and inspections. The previous refueling and
maintenance outage occurred in the fall of 2002. In addition to the Callaway
nuclear plant outage expenses, employee benefit costs were $43 million higher,
primarily because of increased pension and postretirement medical costs. The
adoption in the second quarter of 2004, retroactive to January 1, 2004, of FASB
Staff Position SFAS No. 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related
to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,”
resulted in the recognition of nontaxable federal subsidies expected to be
provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
(the Medicare Prescription Drug Subsidy), which partially offset the employee
benefit cost increases noted above ($11 million).

See Note
1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11 - Retirement Benefits
to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further
information. Expenses at

Ameren,
UE and CIPS were reduced in 2004 by $18 million, $13 million, and $5 million,
respectively, from the refund to UE and CIPS of previously paid exit fees upon
their re-entry into the MISO. Lower labor costs ($21 million) in 2004 also
partially offset the above increases to other operations and maintenance
expenses.

Ameren’s
other operations and maintenance expenses increased $64 million in 2003 as
compared with 2002, primarily due to the $135 million added by the acquisition
of CILCORP, transition costs related to the CILCORP acquisition, higher employee
benefit costs ($17 million), and a net increase in injuries and damages costs
based on claims experience ($6 million). These increases in other operations and
maintenance expenses were partially offset by lower labor costs resulting
primarily from the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early
2003 and lower plant maintenance costs because of the number and timing of
outages ($60 million). There was no refueling outage at the Callaway nuclear
plant in 2003.

UE

Other
operations and maintenance expenses at UE increased $38 million in 2004 as
compared with 2003, primarily because of increased power plant maintenance
expenses as a result of the refueling and maintenance outage at UE’s Callaway
nuclear plant discussed above ($39 million). In addition to the Callaway outage
expenses, employee benefit costs were increased by $8 million. These were
primarily increased pension costs, partially offset by reduced postretirement
costs due to the adoption of FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 106-2, noted above. In
addition, the refund of exit fees upon UE’s re-entry into the MISO as discussed
above ($13 million) also partially offset the increased costs.

UE’s
other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $49 million in 2003 as
compared with 2002, primarily because of lower labor costs related to the
voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003 and lower plant
maintenance costs ($34 million), partially offset by the higher employee benefit
costs ($10 million) and an increase in injuries and damages costs ($3
million).

CIPS

CIPS’
other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $8 million in 2004 as
compared with 2003, primarily because of CIPS’ portion of the MISO exit fee
refund ($5 million) as discussed above and lower labor costs, partially offset
by increased employee benefit costs ($2 million).

CIPS’
other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $5 million in 2003 as
compared with 2002, primarily because of lower labor costs related to the
voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003, and a decrease
in environmental remediation costs ($3 million), partially offset by an increase
in injuries and damages costs of $8 million.

Genco

Other
operations and maintenance expenses at Genco decreased $6 million in 2004 as
compared with 2003, primarily because of a reduction in power plant maintenance
($10 million) as a result of fewer outages and lower labor costs, partially
offset by increased employee benefit costs ($5 million).

Genco’s
other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $21 million in 2003 as
compared with 2002, primarily because of a reduction in consulting costs at its
coal-fired generation plants, a decrease in commitment fees for the use of UE’s
and CIPS’ electric transmission lines ($5 million), and a net decrease in
injuries and damages costs ($3 million).

CILCORP
and CILCO

CILCORP’s
other operations and maintenance expenses increased by $41 million in 2004 as
compared with 2003, primarily because of higher employee benefit costs ($12
million), and additional injuries and damages costs ($4 million). Pursuant to an
arrangement entered into between Ameren and AES in conjunction with the
acquisition of CILCORP, AES indemnified CILCORP and CILCO for the $13 million
after-tax cost of the $21 million settlement of a litigation claim by Enron
Power Marketing Inc. As a result, other operations and maintenance expenses
includes the net


cost of
$8 million while income taxes reflect a tax benefit of $8 million, resulting in
no net income statement effect. See

Note 15 -
Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8,
of this report for further information on the Enron Power Marketing, Inc.
litigation claim

.

CILCO’s
other operations and maintenance expenses increased $33 million in 2004 as
compared with 2003, primarily because of the litigation settlement, discussed
above, additional injuries and damage costs ($4 million), increased maintenance
($3 million), increased technology expenses ($3 million), and higher overhead
allocations. Partially offsetting these increases to other operations and
maintenance expenses at CILCORP and CILCO were reduced labor costs in
2004.

CILCORP’s
other operations and maintenance expenses in 2003 were comparable to 2002.
CILCO’s other operations and maintenance expenses increased $19 million in 2003
as compared with 2002, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs ($19
million) and higher bad debt expense ($5 million), substantially offset by
reduced environmental costs ($9 million) for remediation of elevated boron
levels at the Duck Creek power plant recycle pond in 2002.

IP

IP’s
other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $19 million in 2004 as
compared with 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from the reimbursement of
the MISO exit fee and RTO development costs ($9 million), as well as reduced
labor costs and other operating efficiencies ($12 million), partially offset by
higher employee benefit costs ($8 million) and costs associated with injuries
and damages reserves.

The
increase in other operations and maintenance expenses at IP of $12 million for
2003 over 2002 was primarily due to higher employee benefit costs ($11 million)
and insurance claims and an increase in legal reserves ($16 million), partially
offset by operating efficiencies and reduced technology expenditures ($14
million).

Voluntary
Retirement and Other Restructuring Charges and Coal Contract
Settlement

See Note
7 - Restructuring Charges and Other Special Items to our financial statements
under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

Depreciation
and Amortization

versus 2003

Ameren’s,
UE’s and IP’s depreciation and amortization expenses increased $38 million, $10
million and $2 million, respectively, in 2004 as compared with 2003, because of
capital additions. Depreciation and amortization expenses at Ameren also
increased in 2004 because of the inclusion of the additional month of CILCORP
expenses of $6 million and three months of IP expenses of $21 million.
Amortization of regulatory assets at IP decreased $9 million in 2004 from 2003
as the transition cost regulatory asset was written off in purchase accounting
in conjunction with Ameren’s acquisition of IP.

Depreciation
and amortization expenses at CIPS and Genco in 2004 were comparable to
2003.

Depreciation
and amortization expenses at CILCORP and CILCO decreased $9 million and $6
million, respectively, in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because reduced
expenses as a result of property retirements at the end of 2003 exceeded the
increased expense from new capital additions in 2004. CILCORP depreciation was
also favorably affected by reduced purchase accounting amortization adjustments.

versus 2002

Depreciation
and amortization expenses increased $88 million and $6 million at Ameren and
Genco, respectively, in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase at Ameren was
primarily due to the inclusion of $72 million of CILCORP expense in 2003. In
addition, depreciation and amortization expenses increased at Ameren and Genco
because of new capital additions.

Depreciation
and amortization expenses increased $3 million at UE in 2003 as compared with
2002, primarily because of capital additions, partially offset by a decrease of
$5 million resulting from a reduction in depreciation rates. The reduction in
depreciation rates of $5 million in 2003 was based on the updated analysis of
asset values, service lives, and accumulated depreciation levels that was
required by UE’s 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement.

Depreciation
and amortization expenses increased $6 million at CILCORP in 2003 as compared
with 2002, primarily because of purchase accounting adjustments that increased
the book value of the Duck Creek and E.D. Edwards power plants and the Sterling
Avenue peaking station ($7 million).

Depreciation
and amortization expenses at CIPS, CILCO and IP in 2003 were comparable to 2002.
Amortization of regulatory assets at IP decreased $32 million in 2003 from 2002
primarily due to reduced amortization of the transition cost regulatory asset.
In 2002, IP’s increased financial performance allowed for additional recognition
of amortization as compared with 2003.


Taxes
Other Than Income Taxes

versus 2003

Taxes
other than income taxes increased $13 million at Ameren in 2004 as compared with
2003. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP ($6 million) and the three
months of IP $15 million included in the current year, taxes other than income
taxes decreased $8 million. The decrease was primarily due to decreased gross
receipts taxes, partially offset by increased property taxes.

UE’s
taxes other than income taxes increased $9 million in 2004 as compared with
2003, primarily because property taxes were higher in 2004.

Taxes
other than income taxes at CIPS, Genco and IP in 2004 were comparable to 2003.

Taxes
other than income taxes decreased at CILCORP and CILCO by $13 million and $14
million, respectively, in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because gross
receipts taxes were down as a result of customers’ switching to Marketing
Company.

versus 2002

At
Ameren, taxes other than income taxes increased $37 million in 2003 as compared
with 2002, primarily because the acquisition of CILCORP added $34 million.

At UE,
taxes other than income taxes decreased $5 million in 2003 as compared with
2002, because of a decrease in gross receipts taxes ($2 million) related to
lower native load customer sales in milder weather and a decrease in real estate
taxes resulting from lower assessments in 2003.

Taxes
other than income taxes at IP increased $10 million in 2003 as compared with
2002, primarily because 2002 expenses benefited from a favorable audit
conclusion on gross receipts taxes of $4 million.

At Genco,
taxes other than income taxes increased $9 million in 2003 as compared with
2002, primarily because of adjustments related to property tax assessments and
increased property taxes associated with the four CTs added in the third and
fourth quarters of 2002.

CIPS’,
CILCORP’s and CILCO’s taxes other than income taxes in 2003 were comparable to
2002.

Other
Income and Deductions

versus 2003

Ameren’s
other income and deductions increased

$18
million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of increased interest
income ($8 million) from the temporary investment of proceeds from Ameren’s
February and July 2004 equity offerings and increased allowance for funds used
during construction ($6 million). The additional month of CILCORP results and
three months of IP results in the current year had a minimal impact on other
income and deductions.

Total
other income at IP decreased $35 million in 2004 as compared with 2003,
primarily because interest income was reduced after the elimination of IP’s Note
Receivable from Former Affiliate in conjunction with Ameren’s acquisition of IP.
See Note 2 - Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
this report for a discussion of the note elimination. O

ther
income and deductions includes interest income of $128 million for 2004 as
compared with $170 million in 2003 under IP’s Note Receivable from Former
Affiliate.

Other
income and deductions at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO were comparable in
2004 to 2003. See

Note 8 -
Other Income and Deductions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8,
of this report for further information

.

versus 2002

Ameren’s
and UE’s net other income increased $34 million and $20 million, respectively,
in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of the expensing of economic
development and energy assistance programs required by the UE Missouri electric
rate case settlement in 2002 ($26 million). Ameren’s other income also increased
in 2003 because of a decrease in the minority interest related to EEI’s lower
earnings in 2003. The increase in UE’s other income was partially offset by a
net decrease in earnings from UE’s ownership interest in EEI and decreased gains
on derivative contracts.

CIPS’
other income decreased in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of a
decline in intercompany interest income ($3 million) CIPS received on the Genco
subordinated promissory note due to a lower outstanding principal balance. In
addition, CIPS’ other income decreased in 2003 as compared with 2002, because of
a decrease in contributions in aid of construction ($2 million).

Genco’s,
CILCORP’s and CILCO’s other income and deductions in 2003 were comparable to
2002.

IP’s
total other income increased $5 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, due to a
gain recognized in 2003 related to an asset retirement obligation, along with
reduced losses on disposal of property and a general reduction in nonoperating
expenses.


Interest

versus 2003

Interest
expense for Ameren in 2004 was comparable to 2003. However, excluding the
additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in the
current year, interest expense decreased at Ameren by $20 million. The decrease
was primarily due to the redemption of $150 million of Ameren floating rate
notes at the end of 2003 and reduced short-term borrowings, as well as
redemptions of long-term debt during 2004 and 2003 at its subsidiaries, as noted
below.

Genco’s
interest expense was reduced $7 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily
due to a reduction in principal amounts outstanding on intercompany promissory
notes to CIPS and Ameren along with decreased borrowings from Ameren’s
non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool. The balance of intercompany notes
payable to CIPS and Ameren was $283 million at December 31, 2004, as compared to
$411 million at December 31, 2003, and $462 million at December 31,
2002.

Interest
expense decreased $1 million at CILCO in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily
because of the redemption of long-term debt of $119 million in 2004 and $100
million in 2003, partially offset by increased intercompany borrowings.

Interest
expense was flat at CILCORP in 2004 as compared to 2003. Redemptions of debt at
CILCO, noted above, and repurchases of an aggregate of $40 million of CILCORP
debt in 2004 and 2003, respectively, were offset by increased intercompany
borrowings.

Interest
expense

decreased
$32 million at IP in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to redemptions and
repurchases of indebtedness of $700 million in 2004 and $190 million in 2003,
reductions in the notes payable to IP SPT, and purchase accounting amortization.
See Note 5 - Short-term Borrowings and Liquidity and Note 6 - Long-term Debt and
Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
report for further information.

Interest
expense at UE and CIPS in 2004 was comparable to 2003.

versus 2002

Interest
expense increased $63 million at Ameren in 2003 as compared to 2002, primarily
because the assumption of CILCORP debt added $48 million to interest expense. In
addition, interest expense was higher in 2003 because Genco issued $275 million
of 7.95% senior notes in June 2002 ($10 million).

Interest
expense decreased $7 million at CIPS in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily
because of the maturity or redemption of first mortgage bonds in the third
quarter of 2002 ($2 million) and in the second quarter of 2003 ($5 million).

Interest
expense increased $15 million at Genco in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily
because of increased borrowings from Ameren’s non-state-regulated subsidiary
money pool ($9 million), partially offset by a reduction in the principal
amounts outstanding on subordinated intercompany promissory notes to CIPS and
Ameren in May 2003 ($4 million). In addition, Genco’s interest expense increased
in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because $275 million of 7.95% senior
notes were issued in June 2002.

Interest
expense decreased $12 million at CILCORP and $5 million at CILCO in 2003 as
compared with 2002, primarily because of the redemption of long-term debt,
partially offset by expenses associated with debt redemption. In addition,
CILCORP interest expense decreased $7 million from the amortization
of purchase accounting adjustments that recorded CILCORP's debt at fair
value.

Interest
expense increased $51 million at IP in 2003 primarily because of the additional
issuances of $150 million and $400 million 11.50% mortgage bonds in 2003 and
2002, respectively, partially offset by the reduction in IP SPT transitional
funding trust notes, the redemption of IP’s $100 million and $90 million
mortgage bonds in August and September 2003, respectively, and the repayment of
IP’s $300 million term loan ($200 million repaid in December 2002 and $100
million repaid in May 2003).

UE’s
interest expense in 2003 was comparable to 2002.

Income
Taxes

versus 2003

Income
tax expense was lower at Ameren in 2004 as compared with 2003, because of a
lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was lower primarily because of
the recording in 2004 of the expected nontaxable federal Medicare Prescription
Drug Subsidy and a tax benefit related to CILCO’s settlement of a litigation
claim.

Income
tax expense increased at CIPS in 2004 as compared to 2003, primarily due to
higher pretax income in 2004 and an Illinois tax settlement in the third quarter
of 2003, which resulted in reduced income taxes in the prior-year period. Income
tax expense increased at Genco and IP in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily
because of higher pretax income in 2004. Income tax expense decreased at UE
primarily because of lower pretax income in 2004. The recording of the
nontaxable federal Medicare Prescription Drug subsidy lowered taxable income at
all the Ameren companies. Income tax expense decreased at CILCORP and CILCO
primarily because of a tax benefit of $8 million as a result of CILCO’s
settlement of a litigation claim and lower


pretax
income in 2004. See also Note 13 - Income Taxes to our financial statements
under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding effective tax
rates.

versus 2002

Income
tax expense increased at Ameren, UE and Genco in 2003 as compared with 2002,
primarily because of higher pretax income, partially offset by a lower effective
tax rate at Ameren. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to an
Illinois tax settlement ($7 million) at CIPS in the third quarter of 2003.
Income tax expense decreased at CILCO and IP primarily because of lower pretax
income. CILCORP’s income tax expense in 2003 was comparable to 2002.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The
tariff-based gross margins of Ameren’s rate-regulated utility operating
companies (UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP) continue to be the principal source of cash
from operating activities for Ameren and its rate-regulated subsidiaries. A
diversified retail customer mix of primarily rate-regulated residential,
commercial and industrial classes and a commodity mix of gas and electric
service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash flows. For cash flow,
Genco principally relies on sales to an affiliate under a contract expiring at
the end of 2006 and sales to other wholesale and industrial customers under
long-term contracts. In addition, we plan to use short-term borrowings to
support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements.

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities

versus 2003

Cash
flows provided by operating activities increased for Ameren in 2004 as compared
with the same period in 2003. The increase in cash flows provided by operating
activities was primarily due to incremental earnings from the acquisition of IP
in the fourth quarter of 2004, lower cash taxes paid with the pension
contribution, IP debt redemption premiums, and accelerated tax depreciation.
Ameren and UE also received $36 million in 2004 as compared with $15 million in
2003, as a result of UE’s settlement in 2003 of a dispute over mine reclamation
issues with a coal supplier, which benefited cash flows from operating
activities.

Cash
flows from operating activities from all the Ameren Companies, except IP, were
negatively affected in 2004 by a $295 million pension contribution made by
Ameren (UE - $186 million; CIPS - $33 million; Genco - $29 million; CILCORP and
CILCO - $41 million).

Cash
flows provided by operating activities increased for CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP
in 2004 as compared with

2003,
primarily because of the increased earnings discussed under Results of
Operations and less cash taxes paid. CILCORP and CILCO also benefited from net
income tax refunds of $40 million and $20 million, respectively. IP’s cash flows
from operations benefited from the 2004 recovery of prepayments related to IP
natural gas purchase contracts made in 2003. These benefits in 2004 were
partially offset at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, and CILCO by the pension
contribution. IP’s cash flows from operations were negatively affected by the
timing of IP’s income tax reimbursements to Dynegy and the effect of the
acquisition on tax payments to Dynegy. Deferred taxes at IP in 2004 benefited
from debt redemption premiums and accelerated tax depreciation resulting from
the acquisition.

Genco’s
cash flows provided by operating activities decreased in 2004 as compared with
2003, primarily because of the timing differences associated with income taxes
and the increased pension contributions, partially offset by increased
earnings.


versus 2002

Cash
flows provided by operating activities increased for Ameren and Genco and
decreased for UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 as compared with 2002. The
increase in c

ash flows
provided by operating activities for Ameren and Genco was primarily a result of
the increased net earnings discussed above under Results of Operations. Ameren’s
increase in earnings in 2003 as compared with the same period in 2002 was
partially attributable to 11 months of CILCORP’s earnings in 2003 associated
with the acquisition. Genco’s cash flows from operating activities also
increased with the receipt of a $76 million tax refund. The increase at Ameren
was reduced by two noncash components of net earnings. One was associated with
the gain of $18 million related to the adoption of SFAS No. 143. The other was
the $51 million pretax gain related to UE’s settlement of the coal mine
reclamation issues, of which only $15 million was received in cash during 2003.

Partially
offsetting these benefits to cash flows from operating activities were increased
materials and supplies inventories resulting from higher natural gas volumes put
into storage and higher natural gas prices.

Cash
provided by operating activities decreased for UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO in
2003 as compared with 2002 primarily because of increased working capital
requirements and timing differences. UE’s decrease in cash flows from operating
activities was attributable to increased tax payments and natural gas inventory
increases, partially offset by lower operations and maintenance expenses and

UE’s
settlement of the coal mine reclamation issues, of which $15 million was
received in cash during 2003. CIPS’ decrease in cash flows from operating
activities was primarily attributable to increased tax payments in 2003 as
compared with 2002.

IP’s cash
flows provided by operating activities decreased in 2003 as compared with 2002
because of the increased earnings discussed above in Results of Operations and
because of changes in working capital primarily related to timing differences in
cash flows. Cash flows were positively affected in 2003 by the receipt of one
additional month of interest income on IP’s Note Receivable from Former
Affiliate. See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions to our financial statements
under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the Note Receivable
from Affiliate. IP’s decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was
partially offset by higher priced natural gas inventories and higher prepayments
due to increased collateral requirements on natural gas purchases.

Pension
Funding

The
Ameren Companies, excluding IP, and EEI made cash contributions totaling $295
million in 2004 and $27 million in 2003 to Ameren’s defined benefit retirement
plan qualified trust. The cash contributions in 2004 and 2003 to Ameren’s
defined benefit retirement plan qualified trusts will, among other things,
provide cost savings because they will allow us to avoid paying a portion of the
insurance premiums to the Pension Guarantee Trust Corporation and will mitigate
future benefit cost increases. Based on our assumptions at December 31, 2004, we
expect to be required under ERISA to fund an aggregate of $400 million for the
period of 2005 to 2009 in order to maintain minimum funding levels for our
pension plan; no minimum contribution will be required until 2008, assuming
continuation of the current federal interest rate relief beyond 2005. We expect
UE’s, CIPS’, Genco’s, CILCO’s and IP’s portion of the future funding
requirements to be approximately 50%, 9%, 9%, 11% and 21%, respectively. These
amounts are estimates and may change with actual stock market performance,
changes in interest rates, any pertinent changes in government regulations, and
any prior voluntary contributions. See Note 11 - Retirement Benefits to our
financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional
information.

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities

versus 2003

Cash
flows used in investing activities increased for Ameren, UE, CILCORP and CILCO
and decreased for Genco i

n 2004 as
compared with 2003. Included in Ameren’s cash flows used in investing activities
was $443 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of IP and Dynegy’s 20%
interest in EEI in 2004 and $479 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of
CILCORP and Medina Valley in 2003. Excluding the cash paid for acquisitions in
2004 and 2003, Ameren’s cash flows used in investing activities increased in
2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of increased capital expenditures,
discussed below, at UE, CILCORP, and CILCO, and the addition of IP’s capital
expenditures after the acquisition date.

CIPS’
cash flows provided by investing activities increased in 2004 as compared with
2003 principally because of increased cash receipts related to the intercompany
note receivable from Genco. The note receivable from Genco was issued in
conjunction with the transfer of CIPS’ generating assets and liabilities to
Genco in 2000. See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions to our financial
statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion of the
note receivable. CIPS’ cash flows provided by investing activities also
increased due to decreased capital expenditures incurred in 2004 as compared
with 2003.

Genco’s
cash flows used in investing activities decreased, principally because capital
expenditures were lower in 2004 than in 2003.

IP’s cash
flows used in investing activities increased principally because of
contributions made to the money pool in 2004.


versus 2002

Cash
flows used in investing activities increased

for
Ameren and UE and decreased for CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 as
compared with 2002.

Ameren’s
increase in cash used in investing activities in 2003 as compared with 2002 was
primarily related to $479 million in net cash paid for the acquisitions of
CILCORP and Medina Valley in early 2003 and capital expenditures for CILCORP in
2003. These increased investing activities in 2003 were partially offset by
lower construction expenditures at other Ameren subsidiaries and lower nuclear
fuel expenditures in 2003. The increase for UE in 2003 over the prior-year
period was primarily related to the 2002 receipt of $84 million UE had invested
in the utility money pool, partially offset by lower construction and nuclear
fuel expenditures in 2003.

The
decrease in 2003 cash

flows
used in investing activities

from the
prior-year period for Genco was primarily related to lower construction
expenditures as Genco

completed
construction of CTs in 2002. In addition,

Genco
paid $140 million in the first quarter of 2002 to Development Company for a CT
purchased, but not yet paid for, at December 31, 2001. The decrease for CILCORP
and CILCO was primarily due to lower construction expenditures related to the
completed installation of pollution-control equipment at their coal-fired power
plants.

The
increase in cash provided by investing activities for CIPS was primarily due to
principal payments received on its intercompany note receivable from Genco.

      intercompany transactions betwee

n

Development
      Company and Genco related to Genco's purchase of a CT in
2002.

Ameren’s
capital expenditures for 2004 principally related to various upgrades at UE’s
power plants, including

the
replacement of condenser bundles, low-pressure rotor equipment and steam
generators, and other upgrades completed during the refueling and maintenance
outage at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant. The replacement and upgrade work at UE’s
Callaway plant resulted in capital expenditures of $40 million in 2004. UE also
incurred capital expenditures related to the installation of new CTs at its
Venice plant and replacement of turbines at its Sioux and Rush Island power
plants in 2004. In addition, UE’s capital expenditures included environmental
and other upgrades at UE power plants and expenditures incurred for new
transmission and distribution lines. CILCORP’s and CILCO’s capital expenditures
in 2004 were primarily related to power plant upgrades made at the Edwards and
Duck Creek plants in order for CILCO’s non-rate-regulated subsidiary, AERG, to
have more flexibility in future fuel supply for power generation.

Genco’s
use of cash in 2004 for capital expenditures was primarily attributed to the
replacement of a turbine generator at its Coffeen power plant. Capital
expenditures at IP consisted of

numerous
projects to upgrade and maintain the reliability of IP’s electric and gas
transmission and distribution systems and to add new customers to the
system.

Ameren’s
capital expenditures for 2003 principally related to various upgrades at UE’s
and Genco’s coal-fired power plants, NO

x

reduction equipment expenditures at CILCO’s generating plants, replacements and
improvements to the existing electric transmission and distribution system and
natural gas distribution system, and construction costs for CTs at UE. In 2002,
UE placed into service 240 megawatts of CT capacity (approximately $135
million). In addition, Genco placed into service 470 megawatts of CT capacity
(approximately $215 million). Also in 2002, Genco paid approximately $140
million to Development Company for a CT purchased but accrued for in December
2001. In addition, selective catalytic reduction technology was added on two
units at one of Genco’s coal-fired power plants at a cost of $42
million.

The
following table estimates the capital expenditures that will be incurred by the
Ameren Companies from 2005 through 2009, including construction expenditures,
capitalized interest and allowance for funds used during construction (except
for Genco which has no allowance for funds used during construction) and

new CTs with approximately 330 megawatts of capacity at UE’s Venice, Illinois
power plant site by the end of 2005. Total costs expected to be incurred for
these units at the Venice power plant are $125 million.

UE
committed to make between $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion of infrastructure
investments during the period January 1, 2002, to June 30, 2006, as part of UE’s
2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement, including the addition of 700
megawatts of generation capacity. The new capacity requirement is expected to be
satisfied by the addition of 240 megawatts in 2002 and the proposed transfer
from Genco to UE, at net book value (approximately $240 million), of
approximately 550 megawatts of CTs at Pinckneyville and Kinmundy, Illinois. As
of December 31, 2004, UE had expended $1.5 billion toward the 2002 rate case
settlement. In addition, commitments totaling at least $15 million for gas
infrastructure improvements between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2006, were agreed
upon as part of UE’s 2003 Missouri gas rate case settlement See Note 3 - Rate
and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
this report for further discussion of these regulatory proceedings.

CIPS’ and
CILCO’s estimated capital expenditures are primarily for transmission and
distribution-related activities. Genco’s estimated capital expenditures are
primarily for upgrades to existing coal and gas-fired generating facilities and
other generation-related activities. CILCO’s estimate also includes capital
expenditures for generation-related activities, as well as for compliance with
new NO

x

control
regulations at AERG’s generating facilities.

IP’s
estimated capital expenditures include energy infrastructure improvements of
$275 million to $325 million through 2006. This commitment was made to the ICC
by Ameren in conjunction with the acquisition of IP. See Note 3 - Rate and
Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
report for further explanation of IP’s infrastructure commitment.

We
continually review our generation port-folio and expected power needs. As a
result, we could modify our plan for generation capacity, which could include
changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our
portfolio, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, and
whether capacity may be purchased, among other things. Any changes that we may
plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital
expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material.

Environmental
Capital Expenditures

Both
federal and state laws require significant reductions in SO


and
NO

x

emissions that result from burning fossil fuels. The Clean Air Act and
NO

x

Budget
Trading Program created marketable commodities called allowances. Each allowance
gives the owner the right to emit one ton of SO


or
NO

x

. All
existing generating facilities have been allocated allowances that are based on
past production and the statutory emission reduction goals. If additional
allowances are needed for new generating facilities, they can be purchased from
facilities that have excess allowances or from allowance banks. Our generating
facilities comply with the SO


limits
through the use and purchase of allowances, the use of low-sulfur fuels, and
through the application of pollution control technology. The NO

x

Budget
Trading Program limits emissions of NO

x

during
the ozone season (May through September). The NO

x

Budget
Trading Program applies to all electric generating units in Illinois beginning
in 2004; it applies to the eastern third of Missouri, where UE’s coal-fired
power plants are located, beginning in 2007. Our generating facilities are
expected to comply with the NO

x

limits
through the use and purchase of allowances or through the application of
pollution control technology, including low NO

x

burners,
over fire air systems, combustion optimization, and selective catalytic
reduction systems.

As of
December 31, 2004, UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI held 1.6 million, 0.4 million, 0.2
million, and 0.3 million tons, respectively, of SO


emission
allowances with vintages from 2004 to 2012. Each company possesses additional
allowances for use in periods beyond 2012. As of December 31, 2004, UE, Genco,
CILCO and EEI Illinois facilities held 290 tons, 22,400 tons, 6,300 tons and
8,600 tons, respectively, of NO

X

emission
allowances with vintages from 2004 to 2007. The Illinois EPA is still
determining some NO

x

emission
allowance allocations for this period and 2008. UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI expect
to use a substantial portion of the SO


and
NO

x

allowances for ongoing operations. Allocations of NO

x

allowances for Missouri facilities will be made when rules are finalized by
Missouri regulators. New environmental regulations, including the Clean Air
Interstate Rule as discussed below, the timing of the installation of pollution
control equipment, and the level of operations will have a significant impact on
the amount of allowances actually required for ongoing operations.

In
mid-December 2003, the EPA issued proposed regulations with respect to
SO


and
NO

x

emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury

emissions
from

coal-fired
power plants

.

The new
rules, if adopted, will require significant additional reductions in these
emissions from UE, Genco and CILCO power plants in phases, beginning in 2010.
The rules are currently under a public review and comment period and may change
before being issued as final. We do not expect regulations to be finalized until
the first half of 2005. The


following
table presents preliminary estimated capital costs based on current technology
for the Ameren systems to comply with the

Clean Air
Interstate Rule and mercury

rules, as
proposed.

The
timing of estimated capital costs between periods at UE will be influenced by
whether excess emission credits are used to comply with the proposed rules,
thereby deferring

capital
investment. Amounts for 2005 and 2006 to 2009 are included in our estimated
capital expenditures table above.

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities

versus 2003

Cash
flows from financing activities increased for Ameren in 2004 as compared with
2003 principally because more proceeds were received from the issuance of common
stock, short-term debt, and long-term debt; it totaled $2.2 billion in 2004 as
compared with $1.1 billion in 2003. Proceeds of $1.3 billion received from the
issuance of common stock in February 2004 and July 2004 were used to fund the
cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of IP and Dynegy’s 20%
interest in EEI and to reduce high-cost IP debt assumed as part of the
transaction and to pay related premiums. Proceeds received from the issuance of
common stock in 2003 and 2002 were principally used by Ameren for the
acquisition of CILCORP in January 2003. See Note 2 - Acquisitions and Note 6 -
Long-term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II,
Item 8, of this report for further information. Proceeds received from the
issuance of common stock in 2004 were temporarily used to repay a $100 million
term loan at CILCO and to repay short-term debt totaling $181 million pending
their use for the acquisition and recapitalization of IP. A portion of the
short-term debt was also used to temporarily fund UE’s maturity of long-term
debt totaling $85 million in December 2004.

Ameren’s
increase in cash flows from financing activities was partially offset by
increased redemptions, repurchases and maturities of short-term debt, long-term
debt, and preferred stock, and by the nuclear fuel lease termination payment
totaling $1.5 billion in 2004 as compared with $1.0 billion in 2003. The
issuance of additional common shares and long-term debt cost Ameren an
incremental $26 million in capital issuance costs in 2004 as compared with 2003.
Ameren also paid an additional $69 million in common dividends because more
common shares were outstanding in 2004 than in 2003.

UE’s cash
flows used in financing activities increased in 2004 as compared with 2003. In
2004, cash provided by borrowings from the utility money pool, short-term debt,
and long-term debt issuances totaling $631 million were used for the redemption
and refinancing of long-term debt. In January 2004, UE made a $67 million
payment in order to terminate its nuclear fuel lease arrangement. Also
contributing to UE’s increase in cash used in financing activities were higher
incremental dividend payments made to Ameren in 2004 than in 2003.

CIPS’
cash flows used in financing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003,
principally because of $53 million of repayments to the utility money pool
arrangement in 2004, compared with $121 million of borrowings from the money
pool arrangement in 2003. Increased dividend payments of $13 million to Ameren
in 2004 as compared with 2003 contributed to CIPS’ increase in cash used in
financing activities. Proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt in
2004, along with decreased redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long-term
debt and preferred stock in 2004 as compared with 2003 partially offset CIPS’
increase in cash used in financing activities in 2004.

Genco’s
cash flows used in financing activities decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003,
primarily because of a capital contribution of $75 million received indirectly
from Ameren in 2004. The capital contribution received by Genco in 2004 was used
for Genco’s prepayment of $75 million of the principal amount outstanding under
its intercompany note payable to CIPS. The contribution and cash flows from
operations allowed Genco to reduce money pool borrowings in 2004 as compared
with 2003. Genco had increased dividend payments in 2004 as compared with 2003.

As of
December 31, 2004, Genco had affiliate notes payables of $249 million and $34
million to CIPS and Ameren, respectively, which by their current terms have
final payments of principal and interest due on May 1, 2005. The note payable to
CIPS was issued in conjunction with the transfer of its electric generating
assets and related liabilities to Genco. Genco and CIPS expect to renew or
modify the CIPS note to extend the principal maturity, which is expected to
include continued amortization of the principal amount. Genco and Ameren are
currently evaluating various alternatives with respect to the note payable to
Ameren. In the event that the maturities of these notes are not extended or
restructured, Genco may need to access other financing sources to meet the
maturity obligation to the extent it does not have cash available from its
operating cash flows. Such sources of financing could include borrowings under
the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool, or infusion of equity capital,


or new
direct borrowings from Ameren, all subject to applicable regulatory financing
authorizations and provisions in Genco’s senior note indenture.

CILCORP’s
cash flows from financing activities decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003,
because of lower borrowings. CILCORP’s borrowings from the utility money pool
arrangement and direct intercompany borrowings from Ameren totaled $47 million
in 2004 as compared with $195 million in 2003. A capital contribution from
Ameren of $75 million and increased cash flows from operations allowed CILCORP
to reduce borrowings from the utility money pool. Borrowings from the utility
money pool in the first quarter of 2004 were the source of funds for the
repayment of CILCO’s $100 million secured bank term loan facility. Proceeds from
the issuance of long-term debt were used to redeem a portion of CILCO’s
long-term debt in 2004.

CILCO’s
cash flows used in financing activities decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003,
primarily because of reduced dividend contributions made to CILCORP in 2004 as
compared with 2003, and a $75 million capital contribution received indirectly
from Ameren in 2004. CILCO’s increase in cash flows from financing activities
was partially offset by reduced borrowings from the utility money pool
arrangement in 2004 as compared with 2003.

Cash
flows from financing activities increased modestly for IP in 2004 as compared
with 2003. Capital contributions of $871 million received from Ameren in the
fourth quarter of 2004 were used to redeem and repurchase long-term debt of $700
million and to pay related premiums of $103 million; that compares with $376
million in redemptions of short-term debt and long-term debt in 2003. In 2003,
proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and prepaid interest received from
an affiliate, which totaled $278 million, were used to redeem short-term and
long-term debt.

versus 2002

Cash
flows from financing activities decreased for Ameren, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO
and increased for UE and CIPS in 2003 as compared with 2002. The decrease in
cash flows from financing activities for Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO was primarily
due to an increase in redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long-term
debt. The decrease in cash flows from financing activities for Ameren was also
due to the termination payment on the UE nuclear fuel lease and the incremental
payment of dividends on common stock by Ameren due to increased shares
outstanding. In addition, Ameren had decreased proceeds from the issuance of
long-term debt and common stock, which totaled $1.1 billion in 2003 as compared
with $1.6 billion in 2002. Proceeds from the sale of common shares by Ameren in
2003 and 2002 were primarily used to fund the acquisition of CILCORP, which was
completed in January 2003. See Note 2 - Acquisitions to our financial statements
under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail. Genco’s decrease in
cash flows from financing activities resulted from decreased borrowings from the
non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool, as well as no issuances of long-term
debt in 2003. The decreases in cash flows from financing activities at CILCORP
and CILCO were partially offset by proceeds received from intercompany borrowing
arrangements by CILCORP and CILCO in 2003.

Cash
flows from financing activities increased at UE in 2003 as compared with 2002,
primarily because of additional proceeds received from the issuance of long-term
debt offset by increased redemptions of debt in 2003 as compared with 2002. Cash
flows used in financing activities decreased at CIPS in 2003 as compared with
2002, primarily because of increased proceeds from borrowings from the utility
money pool, offset by increased long-term debt payments.

Cash
flows from financing activities decreased at IP in 2003 as compared to 2002,
principally due to less proceeds received from the issuances of short-term debt
and long-term debt totaling $150 million in 2003 as compared with $460 million
received in 2002. The proceeds received from these issuances in 2003 and 2002,
along with the prepaid interest received from an affiliate totaling $128 million
in 2003, and cash flows from operating activities was used to redeem short-term
debt and long-term debt totaling $376 million in 2003 as compared with $420
million in 2002. Decreased redemptions of debt partially offset IP’s decrease in
cash flows from debt issuances in 2003 as compared with 2002.

Short-term
Borrowings and Liquidity

Short-term
borrowings typically consist of commercial paper issuances and drawings under
committed bank credit facilities with maturities generally from 1 to 45 days.
See Note 5 - Short-term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements
under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

Ameren
      Companies may access these credit facilities through intercompany
      borrowing arrangements.

At
December 31, 2004, certain of the Ameren Companies had committed bank credit
facilities totaling $1,164 million, $789 million of which was available for use,
subject to applicable regulatory short-term borrowing authorizations, by UE,
CIPS, CILCO, IP and Ameren Services through a utility money pool agreement. At
December 31, 2004, UE had $375 million of commercial paper borrowings
outstanding, which reduced the available amounts under these facilities. All of
the $789 million was available for use, subject to applicable regulatory
short-term borrowing authorizations, by Ameren directly, by CILCORP through
direct short-term borrowings from Ameren, and by most of the non-rate-regulated
subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Resources Company, Genco, Marketing
Company, AFS, AERG and Ameren Energy, through a non-state-regulated subsidiary
money pool agreement. Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its
subsidiaries to coordinate and provide for certain short-term cash and working
capital requirements. Separate money pools are maintained for rate-regulated and
non-rate-regulated entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement among
Ameren, IP, and Ameren Services enables IP to make short-term borrowings
directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time
by IP under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money agreement,
together with any outstanding external short-term borrowings by IP, may not
exceed $500 million pursuant to authorizations from the ICC and the SEC under
the PUHCA. Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of
the agreements. See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions to our financial
statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed explanation of
the money pool arrangements and the unilateral borrowing agreement. The
committed bank credit facilities are used to support our commercial paper
programs under which $375 million was outstanding for Ameren on a consolidated
basis at December 31, 2004 ($150 million in 2003). Access to our credit
facilities for all Ameren Companies is subject to reduction based on use by
affiliates.

In
addition to committed credit facilities, a further source of liquidity for
Ameren from time to time is available cash and cash equivalents. At December 31,
2004, Ameren had $69 million of cash and cash equivalents.

Ameren
and UE are authorized by the SEC under PUHCA to have an aggregate of up to of
$1.5 billion and $1 billion, respectively, of short-term unsecured debt
instruments outstanding at any time. In addition, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO have
PUHCA authority to have an aggregate of up to $250 million each of short-term
unsecured debt instruments outstanding at any time. Genco is authorized by the
FERC to have up to $300 million of short-term debt outstanding at any
time.

We rely
on access to short-term and long-term capital

markets
as a significant source of funding for capital

requirements
not satisfied by our operating cash flows. Our inability to raise capital on
favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital
markets, could negatively impact our ability to maintain and grow our
businesses. After assessing our current operating performance, liquidity, and
credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that we will continue to
have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control may
create uncertainty in the capital markets. Such events might cause our cost of
capital to increase or our ability to access the capital markets to be adversely
affected.

the terms and uses of these issuances and the sources of funds and terms for the
redemptions, see Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial

UE
      issued securities totaling $200 million in 2003, $404 million in 2004 and
      $85 million in January 2005.

In March
2004, the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 registration statement filed by
Ameren in February 2004, authorizing the offering of 6 million additional shares
of its common stock under DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are,
at Ameren’s option, newly issued shares or treasury shares, or shares purchased
in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently
selling newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Ameren is also
currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under certain of its
401(k) plans pursuant to effective SEC Form S-8 registration statements. Under
DRPlus and our 401(k) plans, Ameren issued 2.3 million shares of common stock in
2004 valued at $107 million. Under DRPlus and our 401(k) plans, Ameren issued
2.5 million and 2.3 million shares of common stock in 2003 and 2002,
respectively, that were valued at $105 million and $93 million for the
respective years.

Ameren,
UE and CIPS may sell all or a portion of the remaining securities registered
under the open registration statements if market conditions and capital
requirements warrant such a sale. Any offer and sale will be made only by means
of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

Indebtedness
Provisions and Other Covenants

See Note
5 - Short-term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part
II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the covenants and provisions
contained in certain of the Ameren Companies’ bank credit facilities. Also see
Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under
Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and provisions
contained in certain of the Ameren Companies’ indenture agreements and articles
of incorporation.

Dividends

Common
Dividends

Ameren
paid common stock dividends to its shareholders totaling $479 million, or $2.54
per share, in 2004, $410 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2003, and $376 million,
or $2.54 per share, in 2002. This resulted in a payout rate based on net income
of 90%, 78% and 98% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Dividends paid to
common shareholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities for
the same periods were 42%, 40% and 44%, respectively.

The
amount and timing of dividends payable on Ameren’s common stock are within the
sole discretion of Ameren’s board of directors. The board of directors has so
far not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock
dividends. However, the board considers various issues including Ameren’s
historic earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, cash flow and potential
cash flow requirements, dividend payout rates at other utilities, return on
investments with similar risk characteristics and overall business
considerations. On February 11, 2005, Ameren’s board of directors declared a
quarterly common stock dividend of 63.5 cents per share payable on March 31,
2005, to shareholders of record on March 9, 2005.

Certain
of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain
covenants and conditions that, among other things, restrict the Ameren
Companies’ payment of dividends. Ameren would experience restrictions on
dividend payments if it were to defer contract adjustment payments on its equity
security units. UE would experience restrictions on dividend payments if it were
to extend or defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures. CIPS has
provisions restricting its dividend payments based on ratios of common stock to
total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses
and accumulations of earned surplus. Genco’s indenture includes restrictions
that prohibit making any dividend payments if debt service coverage ratios are
below a defined threshold. CILCORP has restrictions if leverage ratio and
interest coverage ratio thresholds are not met or if CILCORP’s senior long-term
debt does not have specified ratings as described in its indenture. CILCO has
restrictions on dividend payments relative to the ratio of its balance of
retained earnings to the annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock and
amounts to be set aside for any sinking fund retirement of its 5.85% Series
preferred stock. At December 31, 2004, none of the conditions described above
that would restrict the payment of dividends existed. In its approval of the
acquisition of IP by Ameren, the ICC issued an order that provides for the
ability of IP to pay dividends on its common stock subject to certain conditions
related to credit ratings of IP and Ameren and the elimination of IP’s 11.5%
mortgage bonds. Given the current credit ratings of IP and the amount of IP’s
11.5% mortgage bonds that

remain
outstanding, IP’s payment of dividends on its common stock is restricted to $80
million in 2005 and $160 million cumulatively through 2006. In addition, in
accordance with the order issued by the ICC, IP will establish a dividend policy
comparable to the dividend policy of Ameren’s other Illinois utilities and
consistent with achieving and maintaining a common equity to total
capitalization ratio between 50% and 60%.


The
following table presents dividends paid by Ameren Corporation and by Ameren’s
subsidiaries to their respective parents and also includes amounts retained by
Ameren Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002:

(a)

Prior
      to February 2003, CILCORP’s dividends would have been paid to AES. These
      amounts are excluded from the total dividends paid to Ameren. CILCO paid
      dividends of $10 million, $62 million, and $40 million in 2004, 2003, and
      2002, respectively.

(b)

Prior
      to October 2004, the ICC prohibited IP from paying dividends. If permitted
      to be paid, IP’s dividends would have been paid directly to Illinova or
      indirectly to Dynegy.

Preferred
Dividends

Certain
of the Ameren Companies have issued preferred stock on which they are obliged to
make preferred dividend payments. Each company board of directors declares the
preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating
the date on which it is payable and the amount that will be paid. See Note 10 -
Stockholder Rights Plan and Preferred Stock to our financial statements under
Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail concerning the preferred
stock issuances.

course of business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any
significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future.

On July
8, 2004, Moody’s confirmed Ameren’s A3 senior unsecured debt and bank loan
ratings along with its A3 issuer rating. Moody’s outlook for these ratings is
stable.

This
rating action concluded Moody’s review of Ameren's long-term ratings that was
initiated on February 4, 2004, in connection with Ameren's agreement to purchase
IP from Dynegy. Ameren's Prime-2 rating for short-term debt, including
commercial paper, was not under review, and was affirmed.

On July
30, 2004, S&P affirmed its A- long-term corporate credit ratings on Ameren,
UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO and removed the ratings from CreditWatch with
negative implications. The A-2 short-term credit ratings for Ameren and UE were
not on CreditWatch. The outlook is negative for the long-term
ratings.

On
October 1, 2004, S&P raised its corporate credit rating and senior secured
debt rating on IP from B to A- as a result of the completed acquisition of IP by
Ameren. At the same time, S&P removed the rating from CreditWatch with
positive implications and assigned a negative outlook to the rating. Also on
this date, Moody’s upgraded the senior secured debt rating of IP from Ba3 to
Baa3 also as a result of the closing of the acquisition. Moody’s has a stable
outlook assigned to this rating. These new ratings assigned to IP by S&P and
Moody’s are investment-grade.


Any
adverse change in the Ameren Companies’ credit ratings may reduce access to
capital and/or increase the cost of borrowings, resulting in a negative impact
on earnings. At December 31, 2004, if the Ameren Companies were to receive a
sub-investment-grade rating (less than BBB- or Baa3), Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco,
CILCORP, CILCO and IP could have been required to post collateral for certain
trade obligations amounting to $76 million, $27 million, $-, $4 million, $2
million, $2 million, and $25 million, respectively. In addition, the cost of
borrowing under our credit facilities can increase or decrease based on credit
ratings. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities; and it should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
rating organization.

OUTLOOK

We expect
the following industrywide trends and Ameren-specific issues to affect earnings
in 2005 and beyond:

·

Ameren,
      CILCORP, CILCO and IP expect to continue to focus on realizing integration
      synergies associated with these acquisitions, including lower fuel costs
      at CILCORP and CILCO and reduced administrative and operating expenses at
      IP.

·

We
      expect continued economic growth in our service territory to benefit
      electric demand in 2005.

·

In
      2005, we expect natural gas and coal prices to support power prices
      similar to 2004 levels. Power prices in the Midwest affect the amount of
      revenues UE, Genco and AERG can generate by marketing any excess power
      into the interchange markets. Power prices in the Midwest also influence
      the cost of power we purchase in the interchange markets.

·

Ameren’s
      coal and related transportation costs rose in 2004 and are expected to
      rise 3% to 4% in 2005 and again in 2006, and to increase further beyond
      2006.

·

Due
      to recent or future regulatory proceedings, there could be changes to the
      agreement between UE and Genco to dispatch electric generation jointly.
      Any change would likely result in a transfer of electric margins between
      Genco and UE and could ultimately affect the pricing of electric transfers
      between Genco and UE. Ameren’s earnings could be affected if and when
      electric rates for UE are adjusted by the MoPSC to reflect any such
      transfers, amendments to the joint disptach agreement and other
      changes in costs of providing electric service. See Note 3 - Rate and
      Regulatory Matters and Note 14 - Related Party Transactions to our
      financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a more
      detailed description of the joint dispatch agreement and potential
      impacts.

·

UE
      is currently seeking approval from the MoPSC to add Noranda Aluminum to
      its service territory. This customer’s load requirements represent
      approximately 5% of UE’s current load. UE is also seeking to transfer its
      Illinois service territory to CIPS. Genco and UE are seeking to transfer
      550 megawatts of CTs from Genco to UE. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory
      Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
      report.

·

UE’s
      Callaway nuclear plant will have a refueling and maintenance outage in the
      fall of 2005, which is expected to last 70 to 75 days. During this outage,
      major capital equipment will be replaced, which means that the outage will
      last longer than a typical refueling outage, which usually lasts 30 to 35
      days and occurs approximately every 18 months. The delivery of some major
      equipment for this outage is dependent on adequate water levels in the
      Missouri River. Any delays or damage during shipment could result in
      additional costs and deferral of the project. During a refueling outage,
      maintenance and purchased power costs increase, so the amount of excess
      power available for sale decreases versus non-outage
  years.

·

Over
      the next few years, we expect increased expenses for rising employee
      benefit costs as well as higher insurance and security costs associated
      with additional measures we have taken, or may have to take, at UE’s
      Callaway nuclear plant and our other operating
plants.

·

We
      are currently undertaking cost reduction or control initiatives associated
      with the strategic sourcing of purchases and streamlining of
      administrative functions. UE, Genco and CILCO are also seeking to raise
      the equivalent availability and capacity factors of power plants from our
      2004 levels.

·

Electric
      rates for Ameren's operating subsidiaries have been fixed or declining for
      periods ranging from 12 years to 22 years.  In 2006, electric rate
      adjustment moratoriums and intercompany power supply contracts expire in
      Ameren's regulatory jurisdictions.  Approximately 8 million
      megawatthours supplied annually by Genco and 6 million megawatthours
      supplied annually by AERG have been subject to contracts to provide CIPS
      and CILCO, through AERG, with power.  The prices in these power
      supply contracts of $34.00 per megawatthour for AERG and $38.50 per
      megawatthour for Genco were below estimated market prices for similar
      contracts in February 2005.  CIPS, CILCO and IP made a filing with
      the ICC, in February 2005, outlining, among other things, a proposed
      framework for generation procurement after 2006.  In 2005, Ameren
      will also begin the process of preparing utility cost-of-service studies
      for filing in Illinois and Missouri in late 2005 or early 2006 to
      determine rates for UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP.  Based on current
      assumptions, Ameren expects the average rates for its Illinois utilities,
      in a combined basis, may increase by 10% to 20% in 2007 over present
      bundled rate levels, with 50% to 70% of this increase resulting from
      higher power costs.  See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
      financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
  report.


·

The
      EPA has proposed more stringent emission limits on all coal-fired power
      plants. Between 2005 and 2015, Ameren expects that certain of the Ameren
      Companies will be required to invest between $1.4 and $1.9 billion to
      retrofit their power plants with pollution control equipment. These
      investments will also result in higher ongoing operating expenses.
      Approximately two-thirds of this investment will be in Ameren’s regulated
      Missouri operations and therefore is expected to be recoverable over
      time from ratepayers.  The recoverability of amounts expended in
      non-rate-regulated operations will depend on the adjustment of market
      prices for power as a result of this increased
  investment.

The
outcome and developments related to the above items could have a material impact
on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Additionally, in
the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to enhance our results
of operations, financial position, and liquidity. These strategies may include
acquisitions, divestitures, and opportunities to reduce costs or increase
revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase Ameren’s shareholder
value. We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be
executed. The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on
our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

REGULATORY
MATTERS

See Note
3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item
8, of this report.

ACCOUNTING
MATTERS

Critical
Accounting Policies

Preparation
of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP
requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance,
as well as the use of estimates. Our application of these policies involves
judgments regarding many factors which, in and of themselves, could materially
affect the financial statements and disclosures. In the table below, we have
outlined the critical accounting policies that we believe are most difficult,
subjective or complex. A

future
change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following
matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial
results.

All
      of the Ameren Companies, except Genco, defer costs as regulatory assets in

Basis
      for Judgment

We
      determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by
      state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other
      factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. If facts
      and circumstances led us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset was
      probably no longer capable of being recovered, we would record a charge to
      earnings, which could be material.

Impact
of Future Accounting Pronouncements

See Note
1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under
Part II, Item 8, of this report.

EFFECTS
OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

Our rates
for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the MoPSC and the
ICC. Nonretail electric rates are regulated by the FERC. Our Missouri electric
and gas rates were set through June 30, 2006, as part of the settlement of our
Missouri electric and gas rate cases. Our Illinois electric rates are
legislatively fixed through January 1, 2007

.

Even
without these moratoriums on rate changes, adjustments to rates are based on a
regulatory process that primarily reviews a historical period. As a result,
revenue increases will lag changing prices. Inflation affects our operations,
earnings, stockholders’ equity, and financial performance.

The
current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded
historical cost. Under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of
plant is recoverable from customers. As a result, cash flows designed


to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation
might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years. The generation
portion of our business in the Illinois jurisdiction is principally
non-rate-regulated and therefore does not have regulated recovery mechanisms.

In our
retail electric utility jurisdictions, there are no provisions for adjusting
rates to accommodate changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the
cost of purchased power. In our retail gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas
costs are

generally
reflected in billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. UE, Genco, CILCORP
and CILCO are affected by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent
they must purchase natural gas to run CTs. They have structured various supply
agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins to
minimize the impact to the financial statements. See Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk - Commodity Price Risk under Part II,
Item 7A, of this report for further information

.

ITEM
7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK.

Market
risk represents the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial
instrument, derivative or non-derivative, caused by fluctuations in market
variables such as interest rates. The following discussion of our
risk-management activities includes forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those
projected in the forward-looking statements. We handle market risks in
accordance with established policies, which may include entering into various
derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we also face risks
that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks, principally
business, legal and operational risks, are not represented in the following
discussion.

Our
risk-management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets within
prudent risk parameters. Our risk-management policies are set by a Risk
Management Steering Committee, which comprises senior-level Ameren officers.

Interest
Rate Risk

We are
exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated
with:

·

long-term
      and short-term variable-rate debt;

·

fixed-rate
      debt;

·

commercial
      paper; and

·

auction-rate
      long-term debt.

We manage
our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we
hold within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of
market changes in interest rates.

The
following table presents the estimated increase (decrease) in our annual
interest expense and net income if interest rates were to increase by 1% on
variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2004:

Calculations
      are based on an effective tax rate of 35%.

The model
does not consider the effects of the reduced level of potential overall economic
activity that would exist in such an environment. In the event of a significant
change in interest rates, management would probably take actions to further
mitigate our exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of
the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the
sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial
structure.

Credit
Risk

Credit
risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to
perform as contracted. NYMEX-traded futures contracts are supported by the
financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the NYMEX and have
nominal credit risk. On all other transactions, we are exposed to credit risk in
the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the
transaction.

Our
physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of
trade accounts receivables, executory contracts with market risk exposures, and
leverage lease investments. The risk associated with trade receivables is
mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups
who make up our customer base. At D

ecember
31, 2004, no nonaffiliated customer represented greater than 10%, in the
aggregate, of our accounts receivable. Our revenues are primarily derived from
sales of electricity and natural gas to customers in Missouri and Illinois. UE,
Genco and Marketing Company have credit exposure associated with accounts
receivables from non-affiliated companies for interchange sales. At December 31,
2004, UE’s, Genco’s and Marketing Company’s combined credit exposure to
non-investment-grade counterparties related to interchange sales was $2 million,
net of collateral (2003 - $4 million). We establish credit limits for these
counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing
basis through a credit risk-management program that involves daily exposure
reporting to senior management, master trading and netting agreements, and
credit support, such as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also
analyze each counterparty’s financial condition prior to entering into sales,
forwards, swaps, futures or option contracts, and we monitor counterparty
exposure associated with our leveraged leases. We are currently


evaluating our credit exposure associated with the
expected implementation of the MISO Day Two on April 1, 2005, but we are unable
to predict at this time what impact it will have, if any.

Equity
Price Risk

Our costs
of providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are
dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rate of return on plan assets,
discount rate, the rate of increase in health care costs and contributions made
to the plans. The market value of our plan assets was affected by declines in
the equity market in 2000 through 2002 for the pension and postretirement plans.
As a result, at December 31, 2002, we recognized an additional minimum pension
liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,”
which resulted in an after-tax charge to OCI and a reduction in stockholders’
equity of $102 million. In 2004, an after-tax charge to the minimum pension
liability was increased, resulting in OCI of  $

million, offsetting the $46 million of OCI in 2003 from a reduction in the
minimum pension liability and an increase in stockholders’ equity. The following
table presents the minimum pension liability amounts, after taxes, as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003:

(b)

CILCORP
      consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances.

(c)

Represents
      predecessor information in 2003.

The
amount of the pension liability as of December 31, 2004, was the result of asset
returns, interest rates, and our contributions to the plans during 2004. In
future years, the liability recorded, the costs reflected in net income, or OCI,
or cash contributions to the plans could increase materially without a recovery
in equity markets in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 8.5%. If the
fair value of the plan assets were to grow and exceed the accumulated benefit
obligations in the future, then the recorded liability would be reduced and a
corresponding amount of equity would be restored, net of taxes.

UE also
maintains trust funds, as required by the NRC and Missouri and Illinois state
laws, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning. As of December 31,
2004, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities (67%),
debt securities (29%), and cash and cash equivalents (4%) and totaled $235
million at fair value (2003 - $212 million). By maintaining a portfolio that
includes long-term equity investments, UE seeks to maximize the returns to be
utilized to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of
risk. However, the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to
price fluctuations in equity markets and the fixed-rate, fixed-income securities
are exposed to changes in interest rates. UE actively monitors the portfolio by
benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by
maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages
of the assets of the trusts to various investment options. UE’s exposure to
equity price market risk is, in large part, mitigated, due to the fact that UE
is currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in its electric rates,
which would include unfavorable investment results.

Commodity
Price Risk

We are
exposed to changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, and natural gas to
the extent they cannot be recovered through rates. We pursue a philosophy of
mitigating financial risks through structured risk-management programs and
policies, structured forward-hedging programs as well as derivative financial
instruments (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts
and financial swap contracts are used). A derivative is a contract whose value
is dependent on, or derived from, the value of some underlying asset.

Ameren’s
generation position is partially hedged through regulated and unregulated sales
to electric customers. The regulated sales are subject to rate approval
mechanisms. UE has an electric rate freeze in place in Missouri through June 30,
2006. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP have electric rate freezes in place in Illinois
through January 1, 2007.

IP has
contracts to purchase power that expire at the end of 2006. Should power
acquired under these agreements be insufficient to meet IP’s load requirements,
IP will be required

to buy
power at market prices. Some purchased power agreements oblige the suppliers to
provide power up to the reservation amount, and at the same prices, even if
individual units are unavailable at various times. Purchased power agreements
with other suppliers do not oblige them to acquire replacement power for us in
the event of a curtailment or shutdown of their plants. Any costs not covered by
rates could not be passed on to ratepayers, which could have an unfavorable
impact on IP’s results of operations.

With
regard to our exposure to commodity price risk for purchased power and
market-based electricity sales, Ameren has two subsidiaries, Ameren Energy and
Marketing Company, whose primary responsibilities include managing market risks
associated with changing market prices for electricity purchased and sold on
behalf of UE, Genco and CILCO. Purchases are generally transacted when they are
economically beneficial to serve load requirements. In addition, Genco and CILCO
have sold nearly all of their available non-rate-regulated peak generation
capacity for the


summers
of 2005 and 2006 at various prices, most of which are fixed.

Similar
techniques are used to manage risks associated with fuel exposures for
generation. Most UE, Genco and CILCO fuel supply contracts are physical forward
contracts. Since UE, Genco and CILCO do not have a provision similar to the PGA
clause for electric operations, UE, Genco and CILCO have entered into long-term
contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal and nuclear fuel in order to
manage their exposure to fuel prices. The coal hedging strategy is intended to
produce reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price
volatility. Price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily
through periodic bid procedures, whereby the amount of coal purchased will be
determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal
purchase guidelines for the given year. We will generally purchase coal up to
five years out, but we may purchase coal beyond five years based on

favorable
market conditions or deal structure. Conversely, the strategy also allows for
the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market
conditions.

Transportation
costs to deliver coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel
costs. We typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply
certainty and mitigate transportation price volatility. The natural gas
transportation expenses for the distribution companies and the gas fired
generation units are controlled by the FERC via published tariffs with rights to
extend the contracts from year to year. Depending on our competitive position,
we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariffs for our
requirements.

The
following table presents the estimated annual increase in our total fuel expense
and decrease in net income if coal and coal transportation costs were to
increase by 1% on any requirements currently not covered by fixed-price
contracts for the five-year period 2005 through 2009:

      balances.

In the
event of a significant change in coal prices, UE, Genco and CILCO would probably
take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk. However,
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their
possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial
structure or fuel sources.

With
regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel, UE has
fixed-priced and base price with escalation agreements and/or inventories to
fulfill its Callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium, conversion, enrichment,
and fabrication services through 2006. UE expects to enter into additional
contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected
remainder of the life of the plant, at prices which cannot now be accurately
predicted. UE’s strategy is to hedge at least 75% of its three-year
requirements

.

This
strategy permits optimum timing of new forward contracts given the relatively
long price cycles in the nuclear fuel markets. It also provides security of
supply to protect against unforeseen market disruptions. Unlike electricity and
natural gas markets, there are no sophisticated financial instruments in nuclear
fuel markets, so most hedging is done via inventories and forward
contracts.

With
regard to our electric generating operations for UE, Genco and CILCO that are
exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run the CTs, the
natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate
delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs. This is accomplished by
optimizing transportation and storage o

ptions
and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple
gas pools and supply basins.

Through
the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been granted
FTRs associated with the advent of the MISO Day Two Market. Marketing Company
has been granted FTRs for its participation in the PJM-Com Ed market. We sought
and received FTRs with the intent to hedge (offset) expected electric
transmission congestion charges related to our physical electricity
business. Depending on the congestion on the grid and prices at various
points on the electric transmission grid, FTRs could result in either
charges or credits. We use complex grid modeling tools to determine which FTRs
we wish to nominate in the FTR allocation process. There is a risk that we
incorrectly modeled the amount of FTRs we will need, and there is the potential
that some of the FTR hedges could be ineffective.

With
regard to UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s natural gas distribution businesses,
exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact there
are gas cost recovery mechanisms (PGA clauses) in place in both Missouri and
Illinois. These gas cost recovery mechanisms allow UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP to
pass on to retail customers prudently incurred costs of natural gas. To
prudently manage costs, our strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market
fluctuations on our regulated natural gas customers. We cannot eliminate the
effects of gas price volatility. However, the gas procurement strategy utilizes
similar risk management techniques and instruments outlined earlier combined
with management of physical assets including storage and operator and balancing
agreements.


The
following table presents the percentages of the projected required supply of
coal and coal transportation for our coal-fired power plants, nuclear fuel for
UE’s Callaway nuclear plant and natural gas for our gas-fired generation (CTs)
and retail distribution, as appropriate, which are price-hedged over the

statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information.

Fair
Value of Contracts

Most of
our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchases and normal
sales. We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market
prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity and emission credits.

Price
fluctuations in natural gas, fuel and electricity cause:

·

an
      unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our firm commitments to
      purchase or sell when purchase or sales prices under the firm commitment
      are compared with current commodity prices;

·

market
      values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power to differ
      from the cost of those commodities in inventory under firm commitment; and

·

actual
      cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities to differ from
      anticipated cash outlays.

The
derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by risk-management
policies that control the use of forward contracts, futures, options and swaps.
Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging
programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required. The
goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while
ensuring sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements. See Note 9 -
Derivative Financial Instruments to our financial statements under Part II, Item
8, of this report for further information.


The
following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) changes in the fair value
of all derivative contracts marked-to-market during the year ended December 31,

ITEM
8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To

the Board
of Directors and Shareholders

of Ameren
Corporation

:

We have
completed an integrated audit of Ameren Corporation’s 2004 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated
f

inancial
statements and financial statement schedule

In our
opinion, the

consolidated

financial statements listed

in the

index
appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Ameren Corporation

and its
subsidiaries

at

December
31, 2004

and 2003,
and the results of

their

operations and

their

cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December
31, 2004

in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in
the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) present

s

fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related

consolidated

financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement

schedule

based

on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed the manner in which it accounts for asset retirement costs as of January
1, 2003.

Internal
control over financial reporting

Also, in
our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial


reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions

of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As
described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,
management has excluded Illinois Power Company from its assessment of internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 because it was acquired
by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2004. We have also
excluded Illinois Power Company from our audit of internal control over
financial reporting. Illinois Power Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Ameren Corporation whose total assets and total revenues represent 18% and 7%,
respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2004.

the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed the manner in which it accounts for asset retirement costs as of January
1, 2003.

SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Ameren,
headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company
registered with the SEC under the PUHCA. Ameren’s primary asset is the common
stock of its subsidiaries. Ameren’s subsidiaries operate rate-regulated electric
generation, transmission and distribution businesses, rate-regulated natural gas
distribution businesses and non-rate-regulated electric generation businesses in
Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Ameren’s common stock are dependent on
distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. Ameren’s principal subsidiaries
are listed below. Also see Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations.

·

UE,
      or Union Electric Company, also known as AmerenUE, operates a
      rate-regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution
      business, and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution business in
      Missouri and Illinois. UE was incorporated in Missouri in 1922 and is
      successor to a number of companies, the oldest of which was organized in
      1881. It is the largest electric utility in the state of Missouri and
      supplies electric and gas service to a 24,500 square mile area located in
      central and eastern Missouri and west central Illinois. This area has an
      estimated population of 3 million and includes the greater St. Louis area.
      UE supplies electric service to 1.2 million customers and natural gas
      service to 140,000 customers. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for
      information regarding the proposed transfer of UE’s Illinois electric and
      natural gas transmission and distribution businesses to CIPS and the
      proposed addition of a large new electric customer.

·

CIPS,
      or Central Illinois Public Service Company, also known as AmerenCIPS,
      operates a rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and
      distribution business in Illinois. CIPS was incorporated in Illinois in
      1902. It supplies electric and gas utility service to portions of central
      and southern Illinois having an estimated population of 1 million in an
      area of 20,000 square miles. CIPS supplies electric service to 325,000
      customers and natural gas service to 170,000 customers.

·

Genco,
      or Ameren Energy Generating Company, operates a non-rate-regulated
      electric generation business. Genco was incorporated in Illinois in March
      2000, in conjunction with the Illinois Customer Choice Law. Genco
      commenced operations on May 1, 2000, when CIPS transferred its five
      coal-fired power plants representing in the aggregate approximately 2,860
      megawatts of capacity and related liabilities to Genco at historical net
      book value. The transfer was made in exchange for a subordinated
      promissory note from Genco in the amount of $552 million and shares of
      Genco’s common stock. Since Genco commenced operations, it has acquired 25
      CTs, which give it a total installed generating capacity of approximately
      4,751 megawatts as of December 31, 2004. Genco is a subsidiary of
      Development Company, a subsidiary of Resources Company, which is a
      subsidiary of Ameren. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for
      information regarding the proposed transfer of Genco’s CTs located in
      Pinckneyville and Kinmundy, Illinois to UE.

·

CILCO,
      or Central Illinois Light Company, also known as AmerenCILCO, is a
      subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company) and operates a rate-regulated
      electric transmission and distribution business, a primarily
      non-rate-regulated electric generation business, and a rate-regulated
      natural gas distribution business in Illinois. CILCO was incorporated in
      Illinois in 1913. It supplies electric and gas utility service to portions
      of central and east central Illinois in areas of 3,700 and 4,500 square
      miles, respectively, with an estimated population of 1 million. CILCO
      supplies electric service to 205,000 customers and natural gas service to
      210,000 customers. In October 2003, CILCO transferred its coal-fired
      plants and a CT facility, representing in the aggregate approximately
      1,100 megawatts of electric generating capacity, to a wholly owned
      subsidiary known as AERG, as a contribution in respect of all the
      outstanding stock of AERG and AERG’s assumption of certain liabilities.
      The net book value of the transferred assets was $378 million. No gain or
      loss was recognized, as the transaction was accounted for as a transfer
      between entities under common control. The transfer was made in
      conjunction with the Illinois Customer Choice Law. CILCORP was
      incorporated in Illinois in 1985.

·

IP,
      or Illinois Power Company, also known as AmerenIP, operates a
      rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution
      business in Illinois. Ameren acquired IP on September 30, 2004, from
      Dynegy, which had acquired it as Illinova in early 2000. IP was
      incorporated in 1923 in Illinois. It supplies electric and gas utility
      service to portions of central, east central, and southern Illinois,
      serving an estimated population of 1.4 million in an area of approximately
      15,000 square miles, contiguous to our other service territories. IP
      supplies electric service to 600,000 customers and natural gas service to
      415,000 customers, including most of the Illinois portion of the greater
      St. Louis area. In 1998, in conjunction with the impairment of the
      Clinton


nuclear power plant, IP underwent a quasi-reorganization.
      In October 1999, IP transferred its wholly owned coal-fired generating
      assets and other generation-related assets and liabilities at net book
      value to a non-rate-regulated subsidiary of Illinova in exchange for an
      unsecured note receivable. In 1999, IP sold its Clinton nuclear power
      plant to AmerGen and entered into a power purchase agreement with AmerGen,
      which required IP to purchase power through December 31, 2004. AmerGen
      also assumed responsibility for operating and ultimately decommissioning
      the nuclear power plant. Concurrent with the sale to Dynegy in early 2000,
      the fossil fuel assets and liabilities were transferred from the Illinova
      non-rate-regulated subsidiary to DMG. The unsecured note receivable was
      eliminated from IP’s balance sheet in conjunction with Ameren’s
      acquisition of IP. See Note 2 - Acquisitions and Note 14 - Related Party
      Transactions for further information.

Ameren
has various other subsidiaries responsible for the short- and long-term
marketing of power, procurement of fuel, management of commodity risks and
provision of other shared services. Ameren has an 80% ownership interest in EEI
through UE and Resources Company, which each own 40% of EEI. This 80% ownership
in EEI includes a 20% interest indirectly acquired by Resources Company from a
Dynegy subsidiary on September 30, 2004. Ameren consolidates EEI for financial
reporting purposes, while UE and Resources Company report EEI under the equity
method.

We use
the words “our,” “we” or “us” with respect to certain information to indicate
that such information relates to all Ameren Companies. When we refer to
financing or acquisition activities, or liquidity arrangements, we are defining
Ameren as the parent holding company. When appropriate, subsidiaries of Ameren
are named specifically as we discuss their various business
activities.

The
financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and
therefore include the accounts of its majority-owned subsidiaries. As the
acquisition of IP occurred on September 30, 2004, Ameren’s Consolidated
Statements of Income and Cash Flows for the periods prior to September 30, 2004,
and Ameren’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003, do not reflect
IP’s results of operations or financial position. Financial information of
CILCORP and CILCO reflected in Ameren’s consolidated financial statements
include the period from January 31, 2003, when these companies were acquired.
See Note 2 - Acquisitions for further information on the accounting for the IP
and CILCORP acquisitions. All significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, unless otherwise
indicated.

In addition to presenting results of operations and
earnings amounts in total, certain information is expressed in cents per
share.  These amounts reflect factors that directly impact Ameren's
earnings.  We believe this per share information is useful because it
better enables readers to understand the impact of these factors on Ameren's
earnings.  All references in this report to earnings per share are based on
diluted shares.

Our
accounting policies conform to GAAP. Our financial statements reflect all
adjustments (which include normal, recurring adjustments) necessary, in our
opinion, for a fair presentation of our results. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates
and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the dates of financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Certain reclassifications have been made to make prior-year financial
statements conform to 2004 reporting.

As part
of the acquisition of IP on September 30, 2004, Ameren “pushed down” the effects
of purchase accounting to the financial statements of IP. Accordingly, IP’s
postacquistion financial statements reflect a new basis of accounting, and
separate financial statement amounts are presented for preacquisition
(predecessor) and postacquistion (successor) periods, separated by a bold black
line. As a result of the acquisition of IP, certain reclassifications have been
made to make IP prior-year financial statements conform to our current
presentation. Additionally, as part of the acquisition of CILCORP on January 31,
2003, Ameren “pushed down” the effects of purchase accounting to the financial
statements of CILCORP, but not to any of CILCORP’s subsidiaries. Accordingly,
CILCORP’s postacquistion financial statements reflect a new basis of accounting,
and separate financial statement amounts are presented for predecessor and
successor periods. CILCO’s financial statements are presented on a historical
basis of accounting for all periods presented.

Regulation

Ameren is
subject to regulation by the SEC. Certain Ameren subsidiaries are also regulated
by the MoPSC, the ICC, the NRC, and the FERC. In accordance with SFAS No. 71,
“Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation,” UE, CIPS, CILCO and
IP defer certain costs pursuant to actions of our rate regulators. These
companies are currently recovering such costs in rates charged to customers. See
Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for further information.


Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash and
cash equivalents include cash on hand and temporary investments purchased with
an original maturity of three months or less.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts Receivable

The
allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable
credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. The allowance is determined
based on application of a historical write-off factor to the amount of
outstanding receivables, including unbilled revenue, and a review for
collectibility of certain accounts over 90 days past due.

Materials
and Supplies

Materials
and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
using the average cost method. The following table presents a breakdown of
materials and supplies for each of the Ameren Companies at December 31, 2004 and

Property
and Plant

We
capitalize the cost of additions to and betterments of units of property and
plant. The cost includes labor, material, applicable taxes, and overhead. An
allowance for funds used during construction, or the cost of borrowed funds and
the cost of equity funds (preferred and common stockholders’ equity) applicable
to rate-regulated construction expenditures, is also added for our
rate-regulated assets. Interest during construction is added for
non-rate-regulated assets. Maintenance expenditures and the renewal of items not
considered units of property are expensed as incurred. When units of depreciable
property are retired, the original costs, less salvage value, are charged to
accumulated depreciation. Asset removal costs incurred by our non-rate-regulated
operations, which do not constitute legal obligations, were expensed as
incurred, beginning in 2003. Asset removal costs accrued by our rate-regulated
operations, which do not constitute legal obligations, are classified as a
regulatory liability. See Accounting Changes and Other Matters relating to SFAS
No. 143 below and Note 4 - Property and Plant, Net for further
information.

Depreciation

Depreciation
is provided over the estimated lives of the various classes of depreciable
property by applying composite rates on a straight-line basis. The provision for
depreciation for the Ameren Companies in 2004, 2003 and 2002 ranged

from 3%
to 4% of the average depreciable cost. Beginning in January 2003, with the
adoption of SFAS No. 143, depreciation rates for our non-rate-regulated assets
were reduced to reflect the discontinuation of the accrual of dismantling and
removal costs. See Accounting Changes and Other Matters relating to SFAS No. 143
below for further information.

Allowance
for Funds Used During Construction

In our
rate-regulated operations, we capitalize the allowance for funds used during
construction, which is a utility industry accounting practice. Allowance for
funds used during construction does not represent a current source of cash
funds. This accounting practice offsets the effect on earnings of the cost of
financing current construction, and it treats such financing costs in the same
manner as construction charges for labor and materials.

Under
accepted ratemaking practice, cash recovery of allowance for funds used during
construction, as well as other construction costs, occurs when completed
projects are placed in service and reflected in customer rates. The following
table presents the allowance for funds used during


construction
ranges of rates that were used during 2004, 2003 and 2002:

Goodwill

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair
value of the net assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment in the
fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances
indicate that the asset might be impaired. Ameren’s, CILCORP’s and IP’s goodwill
relates to the acquisitions of IP and an additional 20% ownership interest in
EEI in 2004 and CILCORP and Medina Valley in 2003. See Note 2 - Acquisitions for
additional information regarding the acquisitions.

Leveraged
Leases

Certain
Ameren subsidiaries own interests in assets that have been financed as leveraged
leases. Ameren’s investment in these leveraged leases represents the equity
portion, generally 20% of the total investment, either as an undivided interest
in the equipment or as a part owner through a partnership. At the time of lease
inception, a debit for rents receivable and estimated residual value was
recorded with a credit to unearned income. These amounts are then adjusted over
time as rents are received, income is realized, and the asset is eventually
sold. Ameren and CILCORP account for these investments as a net investment in
these assets; they do not include the amount of outstanding debt
because the third-party debt is nonrecourse to Ameren and the Ameren
subsidiaries.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

We
evaluate long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be
recoverable. The determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an
estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets as compared with
the carrying value of the assets. If impairment has occurred, we recognize the
amount of the impairment by estimating the fair value of the assets and
recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair
value.

Environmental
Costs

Environmental
costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Estimated environmental expenditures are based on internal and third-party
estimates, which are regularly reviewed and updated. Costs are expensed or
deferred as a regulatory asset when it is expected that the costs will be
recovered from customers in future rates. If environmental expenditures are
related to facilities currently in use, such as pollution control equipment, the
cost is capitalized and depreciated over the expected life of the
asset.

Unamortized
Debt Discount, Premium and Expense

Discount,
premium and expense associated with long-term debt are amortized over the lives
of the related issues.

Fuel
and Gas Costs

In UE’s,
CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s retail electric utility jurisdictions, there are no
provisions for adjusting rates in response to changes in the cost of fuel for
electric generation. In UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s retail gas utility
jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas
customers through PGA clauses.

UE’s cost
of nuclear fuel is amortized to fuel expense on a unit-of-production basis.
Spent fuel disposal cost, based on net kilowatthours generated and sold, is
charged to expense.

Stock-based
Compensation

Effective
January 1, 2003, Ameren adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-based Compensation,” by using the prospective
method of adoption under SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-based Compensation
- - Transition and Disclosure,” for all employee awards granted or with terms
modified on or after January 1, 2003.

Prior to
2003, Ameren, CILCORP and IP accounted for stock options granted under long-term
incentive plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” No stock-based employee
compensation cost was recognized for options granted under Ameren’s plan, either
under the AES Stock Option Plan in which CILCORP’s employees participated or
under the equity compensation plans of Dynegy in which IP employees
participated, as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal
to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

Effective
January 1, 2003, predecessor IP adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123, with respect to options granted to its employees under Dynegy’s
plans, by using the prospective method of adoption under SFAS No. 148. As a
result, all stock options granted after January 1, 2003, were accounted for on a
fair value basis. IP incurred compensation expense over the vesting period of
the options in an amount equal to the fair value of the options. On October 1,
2004, as a result of Ameren’s acquisition of IP, all unvested stock options
granted to IP employees became null and void.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (as revised SFAS No. 123R), “Share
Based Payment,” which revises SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25.
SFAS No. 123R will require companies to measure the cost of employee services
received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date
fair value of the award. The fair value of the award will be remeasured
subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date; the changes in
fair value will be recognized as compensation cost in each period. The
fair-value based method in this statement is similar to the fair-value based
method in SFAS No. 123 in most respects. SFAS No. 123R is effective for Ameren
for the quarterly period ending September 30, 2005. The statement applies to all
awards granted or modified after the effective date. The adoption of this
statement is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations, financial position, or liquidity upon adoption.


Had
compensation cost for all stock options and stock awards granted prior to 2003
been determined on a fair-value basis consistent with SFAS No. 123, net income
would have approximated the following pro forma amounts for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Income
Taxes

Ameren uses an asset and liability approach for its financial accounting and
reporting of income taxes, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for transactions that are treated differently for financial reporting
and tax return purposes. These deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined by statutory enacted tax rates.

We
recognize that regulators will probably reduce future revenues for deferred tax
liabilities initially recorded at rates in excess of the current statutory
rate.  Therefore, reductions in the deferred tax liability, which were
recorded due to decreases in the statutory rate, were credited to a regulatory
liability. A regulatory asset has been established to recognize the
probable future recovery in rates of future income taxes resulting principally
from the reversal of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction - Equity and
temporary differences related to property, plant, and equipment acquired before
1976, which were an unrecognized temporary difference prior to the adoption of
SFAS 109.

Investment tax credits used on tax returns of prior years have been deferred for
book purposes; they are being amortized over the useful lives of the related
properties. Deferred income taxes were recorded on the temporary difference
represented by the deferred investment tax credits and a corresponding
regulatory liability, which recognizes the expected reduction in rate revenue
for future lower income taxes associated with the amortization of the investment
tax credits, was recorded. See Note 13 - Income Taxes for the treatment of IP’s
unamortized investment tax credits and deferred tax liabilities upon the
acquisition of IP by Ameren.

Earnings
Per Share

There
were no differences between the basic and diluted earnings per share amounts for
Ameren in 2004 and 2003. The inclusion of assumed stock option conversions in
the calculation of earnings per share resulted in dilution of $0.01 per share
for 2002. The assumed stock option conversions increased the number of shares
outstanding in the diluted earnings per share calculation by 196,709 shares in
2004, 289,244 shares in 2003 and 332,909 shares in 2002. As only the Ameren
parent company has publicly held common stock, earnings per share calculations
are not relevant, so they are not presented for any of the other Ameren
Companies.

Accounting
Changes and Other Matters

SFAS
No.143 - “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”

We
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143, effective January 1, 2003.

SFAS No.
143 provides the accounting requirements for asset retirement obligations
associated with tangible, long-lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires us to record
the estimated fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets in the period in which the liabilities are incurred
and to capitalize a corresponding amount as part of the book value of the
related long-lived asset. In subsequent periods, we are required to make
adjustments in asset retirement obligations based on changes in estimated fair
value. Corresponding increases in asset book

values
are depreciated

over the
remaining useful life of the related asset. Uncertainties as to the probability,
timing or amount of cash flows associated with an asset retirement obligation
affect our estimates of fair value.

Upon
adoption of the standard, Ameren and Genco recognized a net after-tax gain of
$18 million in the first quarter of 2003 for the cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle. Prior to Ameren’s acquisition of CILCORP, predecessor
CILCORP and CILCO recognized a net after-tax gain in 2003 of $4 million and $24
million, respectively, for the cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle. In addition, in accordance with SFAS No. 143, estimated net future
removal costs associated with Ameren’s, UE’s, CIPS’, CILCORP’s and CILCO’s
rate-regulated operations that had previously been embedded in accumulated
depreciation were reclassified as a regulatory liability.

Prior to
Ameren’s acquisition of IP, predecessor IP recognized a net after-tax loss upon
adoption of SFAS No. 143 of $2 million for the cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle.

At
January 1, 2004, IP’s asset retirement obligation liability totaled $1 million
for obligations under an operating lease. This asset retirement obligation
related to the dismantling of the generation plant and remediation of the plant
site at Tilton, Illinois, which IP had leased to DMG. In July 2004, IP sold the
Tilton assets to DMG and eliminated the related asset retirement obligation
liability as part of the accounting for that transaction. Thus, IP had no asset
retirement obligation liabilities recorded at December 31, 2004.

Upon
adoption of SFAS No. 143, UE recorded asset retirement obligations related to
UE’s Callaway nuclear plant decommissioning costs and to retirement costs for a
UE river structure. Additionally, Genco recorded an asset retirement obligation
for the retirement costs for a Genco power plant ash pond. CILCORP and CILCO
recorded asset retirement obligations related to CILCO’s power plant ash ponds
(now owned by AERG).

Asset
retirement obligations at Ameren and UE increased by $24 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004, to reflect the accretion of obligations to their
present value. Increases to Genco’s, CILCORP’s and CILCO’s asset retirement
obligations due to accretion were immaterial during this period. Substantially
all of this accretion was recorded as an increase to regulatory assets.
Additionally, Ameren and CILCO’s asset retirement obligations increased by
approximately $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, due to
revisions in estimated future cash flows to retire CILCO’s ash
ponds.


In addition to those obligations that have been identified and valued, we
determined that certain other asset retirement obligations exist. However, we
were unable to estimate the fair value of those obligations because the
probability, timing, or cash flows associated with the obligations were
indeterminable. We do not believe that these obligations, when incurred, will
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position,
or liquidity.

The fair
value of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund for UE’s Callaway nuclear plant
is reported in Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund in Ameren’s and UE’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount is legally restricted: It may be used
only to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. Changes in the fair value of
the trust fund are recorded as an increase or decrease to the regulatory asset
recorded in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 143.

In June
2004, the FASB issued an exposure draft on a proposed interpretation of SFAS No.
143. The FASB is expected to issue a final interpretation in the first quarter
of 2005. Under the interpretation, a legal

obligation
to perform an asset retirement activity that is conditional on a future event is
within the scope o

f SFAS
No. 143

.

Accordingly, an entity would be required to recognize a liability for the fair
value of an asset retirement obligation that is conditional on a future event if
the liability's fair value can be estimated reasonably. The exposure draft
provides examples of conditional asset retirement obligations that may need to
be recognized under the provisions of the interpretation, including asbestos
removal. This proposed interpretation could require accrual of additional
liabilities by Ameren and its subsidiaries and could result in increased
expense, which, while not yet quantified, could be material. This proposed
interpretation would be effective for us no later than December 31, 2005, if
issued in its current form.

FIN
No. 46 - “Consolidation of Variable-interest Entities”

In
January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, which changed the consolidation
requirements for special-purpose entities (SPEs) and non-special-purpose
entities (non-SPEs) that meet the criteria for designation as variable-interest
entities (VIEs). In December 2003, the FASB revised FIN No. 46 (FIN No. 46R) to
clarify certain aspects of FIN No. 46 and to modify the effective dates of the
new guidance. FIN No. 46R provides guidance on the accounting for entities that
are controlled through means other than voting rights by another entity. FIN No.
46R requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is designated
as the primary beneficiary.

The
Ameren Companies do not have any interests in entities that are considered SPEs,
other than IP's investment in IP LLC.  FIN No. 46R was effective on March
31, 2004, for any interests the Ameren Companies held in non-SPEs. The adoption
of FIN No. 46R did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements of the Ameren Companies. However, in connection with the adoption of
FIN No. 46R, we have determined that the following significant
variable-interests are held by the Ameren Companies:

·

EEI.
      Ameren has an 80% ownership interest in EEI through UE’s 40% interest and
      Resources Company’s 40% interest. Under the FIN No. 46R model, Ameren, UE,
      and Resources Company have a variable-interest in EEI, and Ameren is the
      primary beneficiary. Accordingly, Ameren will continue to consolidate EEI,
      and UE will continue to account for its investment in EEI under the equity
      method of accounting. The maximum exposure to loss as a result of these
      variable-interests in EEI is limited to Ameren’s, UE’s, and Resources
      Company’s equity investments in EEI.

·

Tolling
      agreement. CILCO has a variable-interest in Medina Valley through a
      tolling agreement to purchase steam, chilled water, and electricity. We
      have concluded that CILCO is not the primary beneficiary of Medina Valley.
      Accordingly, CILCO does not consolidate Medina Valley. The maximum
      exposure to loss as a result of this variable-interest in the tolling
      agreement is not material.

·

Leveraged
      lease and affordable housing partnership investments. Ameren, UE and
      CILCORP have investments in leveraged lease and affordable housing
      partnership arrangements that are variable-interests. We have concluded
      that none of these companies is a primary beneficiary of any of the VIEs
      related to these investments. The maximum exposure to loss as a result of
      these variable-interests is limited to the investments in these
      arrangements. At December 31, 2004, Ameren and CILCORP had net investments
      in leveraged leases of $140 million and $113 million, respectively. At
      December 31, 2004, Ameren, UE, and CILCORP had investments in affordable
      housing partnerships of $19 million, $6 million, and $7 million,
      respectively.

·

IP
      SPT. Ameren acquired a variable-interest in IP SPT with the acquisition of
      IP on September 30, 2004. IP has a variable-interest in IP SPT, which was
      established in 1998 to issue TFNs. IP has indemnified and is liable to IP
      SPT if IP does not bill the applicable charges to its customers on behalf
      of IP SPT or if it does not remit the collection to IP SPT; however, the
      note holders are considered the primary beneficiaries of this
      special-purpose trust. Accordingly, Ameren and IP do not consolidate IP
      SPT.

FASB
Staff Position SFAS No. 106-1 and FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 106-2 -
“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003”

On
December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003 (the Medicare


Prescription
Drug Act) became law. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act introduced a
prescription drug benefit for retirees under Medicare as well as a federal
subsidy for sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit
that is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug
benefit. Through its postretirement benefit plans, Ameren provides retirees with
prescription drug coverage that we believe is actuarially equivalent to the
Medicare prescription drug benefit. In January 2004, the FASB issued FSP SFAS
106-1, which permitted a plan sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that
provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one-time election to defer the
accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug Act. We made this
one-time election allowed by FSP SFAS 106-1.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 106-2, which superseded FSP SFAS 106-1.
FSP SFAS 106-2 provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the Medicare
Prescription Drug Act for employers whose prescription drug benefits are
actuarially equivalent to the drug benefit under Medicare Part D. Ameren elected
to adopt FSP SFAS 106-2 during the second quarter ended June 30, 2004,
retroactive to January 1, 2004. See Note 11 - Retirement Benefits for additional
information on the impact of adoption of FSP SFAS 106-2.

Predecessor IP’s adoption of FSP SFAS 106-2 on July 1, 2004, had no impact on
IP’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity because its drug
benefit was not actuarially equivalent to the drug benefit under Medicare Part
D.

EITF
Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments”

In March 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-1, which
provides guidance on evaluating whether an investment is other-than-temporarily
impaired. The recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1, which were to
be effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2004, were delayed by the
issuance of FSP EITF 03-1, “Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No.
03-1, ‘The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to
Certain Investments,’ ” in September 2004. During the period of delay, we will
continue to evaluate our investments, which primarily constitute our Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Fund, as required by existing authoritative
guidance.

NOTE
2 -

ACQUISITIONS

IP
and EEI

On September 30, 2004, Ameren completed the acquisition of all the common stock
and 662,924 shares of preferred stock of IP (based in Decatur, Illinois) and an
additional 20% ownership interest in EEI from Dynegy and its subsidiaries.
Ameren acquired IP to complement its existing Illinois gas and electric
operations. The purchase included IP’s rate-regulated electric and natural gas
transmission and distribution business serving 600,000 electric and 415,000 gas
customers in areas contiguous to our existing Illinois utility service
territories. With the acquisition, IP became an Ameren subsidiary operating as
AmerenIP.

For a
discussion of the regulatory agency approvals granted in connection with this
acquisition, see Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters.

The total
transaction value was $2.3 billion, including the assumption of $1.8 billion of
IP debt and preferred stock and consideration, including transaction costs, of
$443 million in cash, net of $51 million cash acquired. In February 2005, Ameren
received $5 million from Dynegy representing the final working capital
adjustment pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement. Ameren placed
$100 million of the cash portion of the purchase price in a six-year escrow
account pending resolution of certain contingent environmental obligations of IP
and other Dynegy affiliates for which Ameren has been provided indemnification
by Dynegy. See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies for information on the IP
environmental matter to which the indemnification and escrow applies. In
addition, this transaction included a fixed-price capacity power supply
agreement for IP’s annual purchase in 2005 and 2006 of 2,800 megawatts of
electricity from DYPM. The contract was marked to fair value at closing of the
acquisition. This agreement is expected to supply about 70% of IP’s electric
customer requirements during those two years. The remaining 30% of IP’s power
needs in 2005 and 2006 will be supplied by other companies. In the event that
any of these suppliers are unable to supply the electricity required by these
agreements, IP would be forced to find alternative suppliers to meet its load
requirements, thus exposing itself to market price risk, which could have a
material impact on Ameren’s and IP’s results of operations, financial position,
or liquidity.

Ameren’s financing plan for funding this acquisition included the issuance of
new Ameren common stock. Ameren issued an aggregate of 30 million common shares
in February 2004 and July 2004, which generated net proceeds of $1.3 billion.
Proceeds from these issuances were used to finance the cash portion of the
purchase price and to reduce IP debt assumed as part of this transaction and to
pay related premiums. See Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings for
information on redemptions and repurchases of certain IP indebtedness after the
acquisition.

The
following table presents the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at the date of Ameren’s acquisition of IP and the additional
20% ownership interest in EEI.

Ameren is
completing its valuations of the net assets and liabilities of IP and EEI
acquired, including third-party valuations of property and plant, intangible
assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, and contingent
obligations. As a result, the allocation of the purchase price is preliminary
and subject to further adjustment.

We
expect to finalize purchase accounting in 2005. The fair value of IP’s


power
supply agreements including the fixed-price capacity power supply agreement with
DYPM, discussed above recorded at the acquisition date resulted in a net
liability of $109 million. In addition, we recorded a fair value adjustment,
resulting in a net asset of $24 million, for IP’s power supply agreement with
EEI that expires at the end of 2006.

T

he excess
of the purchase price for IP’s common stock and preferred stock over tangible
net assets acquired has been allocated preliminarily to goodwill in the amount
of $320 million, net of future tax benefits. For income tax purposes, we expect
that a portion of the purchase price will be allocated to goodwill and that such
portion will be deducted ratably over a 15-year period. No specifically
identifiable intangible assets have been identified.

IP’s Note
Receivable from Former Affiliate of $2.3 billion was eliminated as of September
30, 2004, and prior to Ameren’s acquisition of IP to meet the conditions of the
closing. Steps to eliminate the Note were made: (1) reducing the principal
balance by offsetting certain payables owed by IP to

Illinova
and other Dynegy entities; (2) offsetting the principal balance by the amount of
interest that had been paid by Illinova to IP, but not yet earned; and (3)
eliminating a portion in consideration of Illinova’s assumption of IP’s net
deferred tax obligation and IP’s contemporaneous repurchase (and cancellation
immediately thereafter) of 39,892,213 of IP common shares. The 12,751,724 IP
treasury shares held as of December 31, 2003, were canceled in 2004. The
remaining principal balance of IP’s Note Receivable from Former Affiliate was
eliminated, as part of IP’s overall recapitalization, with a corresponding
reduction to IP’s retained earnings. The elimination of IP’s Note Receivable
from Former Affiliate had no impact on IP’s predecessor results of
operations.

The
portion of the total transaction value attributable to Ameren’s acquisition of
Dynegy’s 20% ownership interest in EEI now held by Resources Company was $125
million. This transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition. T

he excess
of the purchase price for this ownership interest over 20% of the fair value of
EEI’s net assets acquired has been preliminarily allocated to property and plant
($80 million) and emission allowances ($41 million), partially offset by a net
liability for power supply agreements ($24 million) and a reduction to net
deferred tax assets ($38 million). The remaining excess was allocated to
goodwill in the amount of $54 million, subject to change based on our final
valuation.

CILCORP
and Medina Valley

On January 31, 2003, Ameren

completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of CILCORP from
AES.

CILCORP
is the parent company of CILCO (based in Peoria, Illinois). With the
acquisition, CILCO became an indirect Ameren subsidiary, but it remains a
separate utility company, operating as AmerenCILCO

.

On
February 4, 2003, Ameren also completed the acquisition from AES of Medina
Valley, which indirectly owns a 40-megawatt, gas-fired electric generation
plant. The results of operations for CILCORP and Medina Valley were included in
Ameren’s consolidated financial statements effective with the respective January
and February 2003 acquisition dates.

The total
acquisition cost was $1.4 billion and included the assumption by Ameren of
CILCORP and Medina Valley debt of $895 million and consideration of $479 million
in cash, net of $38 million cash acquired. The purchase price allocation for the
acquisition of CILCORP and Medina Valley was finalized in January 2004,
resulting in an $8 million decrease in goodwill primarily due to January 2004
adjustments to property and plant, income tax accounts, and accrued severance
expenses. The following table presents the final estimated fair values of the
assets acquired and


liabilities
assumed at the dates of our acquisitions of CILCORP and Medina
Valley.

years. Goodwill of $561 million (CILCORP - $554 million; Medina Valley - $7
million) was recognized in connection with the CILCORP and Medina Valley
acquisitions. None of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes.

RATE
AND REGULATORY MATTERS

Below is
a summary of significant regulatory proceedings. With respect to pending
matters, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these regulatory
proceedings the timing of the final decisions of the various agencies or
the impact on our results of operations, financial position, or
liquidity.

IP
and EEI Acquisition

Ameren received all the regulatory agency approvals necessary to acquire IP and
a 20% interest in EEI from Dynegy on September 30, 2004.

The principal ongoing condition of the FERC’s approval of the acquisition was
that 125 megawatts of EEI’s power be sold to a nonaffiliate of Ameren. The
Missouri Office of Public Counsel and a group of electric industrial customers
of UE, both interveners in the FERC proceeding, have asked the FERC to
reconsider its order deferring to the MoPSC on the question of whether UE should
be required to preserve its current entitlement to the output of EEI’s Joppa
power plant facility. These appeals, which are pending, did not impede the
completion of the acquisition on September 30, 2004. IP joined the MISO on
September 30, 2004, satisfying an additional condition of the FERC’s approval of
the acquisition.

The ICC order approving Ameren’s acquisition of IP contains several important
provisions, including the following:

·

The
      order requires IP to submit quarterly reports in 2005 and 2006 on certain
      milestones regarding IP’s progress in achieving an estimated $33 million
      in annual synergies by the beginning of 2007, and provides for adjustments
      in IP’s next electric and gas rate cases if IP fails to achieve those
      milestones.

·

Commencing
      in 2007, IP will recover over four years, through rates, $67 million in
      reorganization costs related to the integration of IP into the Ameren
      system and the restructuring of IP. As of December 31, 2004, $59 million
      of reorganization costs were incurred and deferred as a regulatory
      asset.

·

The
      order approves a tariff rider to recover the costs of asbestos-related
      litigation claims, subject to the following terms: beginning in 2007, 90%
      of cash expenditures in excess of the amount included in base electric
      rates will be recovered by IP from a $20 million trust fund established by
      IP and financed with contributions of $10 million each by Ameren and
      Dynegy; if cash expenditures are less than the amount in base rates, IP
      will contribute 90% of the difference to the fund; once the trust fund is
      depleted, 90% of allowed cash expenditures in excess of base rates will be
      recovered through charges assessed to customers under the tariff
      rider.

·

Ameren
      commits to cause an aggregate of at least $750 million principal amount of
      IP’s long-term debt, including IP’s $550 million principal amount of
      mortgage bonds 11.50% Series due 2010, to be redeemed, repurchased or
      retired on or before December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2004, $700
      million principal amount of IP debt was retired in accordance with this
      provision.

·

The
      order provides IP with the ability to declare and pay $80 million of
      dividends on its common stock in 2005 and $160 million of dividends on its
      common stock cumulatively through 2006, provided IP has achieved an
      investment grade credit rating from S&P or Moody’s. If, however, IP’s
      $550 million principal amount of mortgage bonds 11.50% Series mortgage
      bonds due 2010 are not eliminated by December 31, 2006, IP may not
      thereafter declare or pay common dividends without seeking authority from
      the ICC. As of December 31, 2004, less than $1 million of the 11.50%
      Series mortgage bonds due 2010 were
outstanding.

·

IP
      will establish a dividend policy comparable to the dividend policy of
      Ameren’s other Illinois utilities consistent with achieving and
      maintaining a common equity to total capitalization ratio between 50% to
      60%.

·

Ameren
      will commit IP to make between $275 million and $325 million in energy
      infrastructure investments over its first two years of
      ownership.

Intercompany
Transfer of Electric Generating Facilities and Illinois Service Territory

In July
2004, the FERC approved the transfer from Genco to UE, at net book value ($240
million) of 550 megawatts of CTs, but the transfer remains subject to SEC
approval under the PUHCA. Approval by the ICC is not required, contingent upon
prior approval and execution of UE’s transfer of its Illinois public utility
operations to CIPS, as discussed below. Approval by the MoPSC is not required in
order for this transfer of generating capacity to occur.


However, the MoPSC has jurisdiction over UE’s ability to
recover the cost of the transferred generating facilities from its electric
customers in its rates.

In May 2003, UE announced its plan to limit its public utility operations to the
state of Missouri and to discontinue operating as a public utility subject to
ICC regulation. UE is seeking to accomplish this by transferring its
Illinois-based electric and natural gas businesses, including its Illinois-based
distribution assets and certain of its transmission assets, at net book value,
to CIPS. In 2004, UE’s Illinois electric and gas service territory generated
revenues of $165 million and had a net book property and plant value of $126
million at December 31, 2004. UE's electric generating facilities and a certain
minor amount of its electric transmission facilities in Illinois would not be
part of the transfer. UE proposes to transfer about half of the assets directly
to CIPS in consideration for a CIPS subordinated promissory note, and
approximately half of the assets by means of a dividend in kind to Ameren,
followed by a capital contribution by Ameren to CIPS. The transfer was approved
by the FERC in December 2003. In September 2004, the ICC authorized the transfer
of UE’s Illinois-based natural gas utility business. The ICC had already
authorized the transfer of UE’s Illinois-based electric utility business to CIPS
in 2000. In February 2005, the MoPSC issued an order that approved the transfer
subject to various conditions described below. The transfer of UE's
Illinois-based utility businesses will also require the approval of the SEC
under the provisions of the PUHCA. A filing seeking approval of both the
transfer of UE’s Illinois-based utility businesses and Genco’s CTs was made with
the SEC in October 2003. If completed, the transfers will be accounted for at
book value with no gain or loss recognition, which is the appropriate treatment
for transactions of this type between two entities under common control.

The MoPSC order approving UE’s transfer of its Illinois-based utility businesses
to CIPS included the following principal conditions:

·

The
      order prevents UE from recovering in rates up to 6% of unknown UE
      generation-related liabilities associated with the generation that was
      formerly allocated to UE’s Illinois service territory unless UE can show
      the benefits of the transfer of the Illinois service territory outweigh
      these costs in future rate cases.

·

The
      order requires an amendment to the joint dispatch agreement among UE,
      Genco and CIPS, to declare that margins on short-term power sales will be
      divided based on generation output as opposed to load. This amendment is
      expected to provide UE with additional annual margins and Genco with
      reduced annual margins of $7 million to $24 million. However, this
      reduction to Genco’s margins is expected to be mitigated by margins
      received from additional power sales by Genco (through Marketing Company)
      to CIPS to serve the transferred UE Illinois-based electric power business
      through the end of 2006 under the current power supply contracts.

·

The
      order requires that, in a future rate case, revenues UE could have
      received for incremental energy transfers under the joint dispatch
      agreement resulting from the service territory transfer be imputed based
      on market prices unless UE can show the benefits of the transfer of the
      Illinois service territory outweigh the difference between the market
      prices and the actual cost-based charges for such incremental energy
      transfers.

Although not expressing dissatisfaction with the MoPSC order, UE, in February
2005, moved the MoPSC to clarify its order to provide that UE may complete the
transfer prior to receipt of all regulatory approvals necessary to effectuate
the required amendment to the joint dispatch agreement and also to provide that
for rate-making purposes, the joint dispatch agreement amendment should be
deemed to be made by UE as of the date the transfer is closed. This
clarification of the MoPSC order is needed, according to UE’s motion, to
facilitate timely electric service to Noranda Aluminum, Inc. as discussed below.
Also in February 2005, the Missouri Office of Public Counsel filed an
application for rehearing of the MoPSC order asserting that the order is
unlawful, unjust, unreasonable and arbitrary in various ways.

See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions for a more detailed discussion of the
joint dispatch agreement.

Missouri

Electric

In August
2002, a stipulation and agreement resolved an excess earnings complaint brought
against UE by the MoPSC staff following the expiration of UE's experimental
alternative regulation plan.  The resolution became effective following
agreement by all parties to the case and approval by the MoPSC.  The
stipulation and agreement includes the following principal
features.

Missouri

Electric

·

The
      phase-in of $110 million of electric rate reductions through April 2004,
      $50 million of which was retroactively effective as of April 1, 2002, $30
      million of which became effective on April 1, 2003, and $30 million of
      which became effective on April 1, 2004.

·

A
      rate moratorium providing for no changes in rates before July 1, 2006,
      subject to certain statutory and other
exceptions.

·

A
      commitment to contribute $14 million to programs for low-income energy
      assistance and weatherization, promotion of energy efficiency and economic
      development in UE’s service territory in 2002, with additional payments of
      $3 million made annually on June


30,
      2003 through June 30, 2006.  This entire obligation was expensed in
      2002.

·

A
      commitment to make $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion in critical energy
      infrastructure investments from January 1, 2002 through June 30, 2006,
      including, among other things, the addition of more than 700 megawatts of
      new generation capacity and the replacement of steam generators at UE’s
      Callaway nuclear plant. The 700 megawatts of new generation is expected to
      be satisfied by UE’s addition of 240 megawatts in 2002 and the proposed
      transfer at net book value to UE of approximately 550 megawatts of
      generation assets from Genco, which is subject to receipt of necessary
      regulatory approvals. See Intercompany Transfer of Electric Generating
      Facilities and Illinois Service Territory within this Note for additional
      information on the proposed transfer.

·

An
      annual reduction in UE’s depreciation rates by $20 million, retroactive to
      April 1, 2002,

based
      on an updated analysis of asset values, service lives, and accumulated
      depreciation levels.

·

A
      one-time credit of $40 million that was accrued during the plan period.
      The entire amount was paid to UE’s Missouri retail electric customers in
      2002 for settlement of the final sharing period under the alternative
      regulation plan that expired June 30, 2001.

·

A
      cost of service study must be filed by January 1, 2006.

Gas

In January 2004, a stipulation and agreement resolved a request by UE to
increase annual natural gas rates. The resolution became effective following
agreement by all parties to the case and approval by the MoPSC. The stipulation
and agreement authorized an increase in annual gas delivery rates of $13
million, effective February 15, 2004. Other principal features of the
stipulation and agreement include:

·

A
      rate moratorium prohibiting changes in gas delivery rates before July 1,
      2006, absent the occurrence of a significant, unusual event that has a
      major impact on UE.

·

A
      commitment to make $15 million to $25 million in infrastructure
      improvement investments from July 1, 2003, through December 31, 2006,
      including replacement of cast iron main and unprotected steel service
      lines. UE agreed not to propose rate adjustments to recover infrastructure
      costs through a statutory infrastructure system replacement surcharge
      prior to January 1, 2006.

·

Commitments
      to contribute an aggregate of $310,000 annually to programs for low-income
      weatherization, energy assistance, and energy-efficient equipment in UE’s
      service territory.

Authority
to Serve Noranda

UE filed
in December 2004 with the MoPSC for authority to extend its Missouri electric
service territory to include the area where Noranda Aluminum, Inc. (Noranda) is
located. Earlier in December, Noranda and UE signed a 15-year agreement to
supply up to approximately 470 megawatts (peak load) electric service (or
approximately 5% of UE’s generating capability, including purchases) to
Noranda’s primary aluminum smelter in southeast Missouri. The supply agreement
would become effective June 1, 2005, subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions. The conditions include the MoPSC granting UE authority to extend its
service territory to include the Noranda facility; completion of the transfer to
UE of 550 megawatts of CTs at Pinckneyville and Kinmundy, Illinois, by Genco, as
discussed above in this Note under Intercompany Transfer of Electric Generating
Facilities and Illinois Service Territory; completion of the transfer of UE’s
Illinois service territory, also as discussed under that caption in this Note;
and approval by the MoPSC of a proposed large customer transmission service
rate. In February 2005, UE and other parties executed and filed a stipulation
resolving all of the outstanding issues pending before the MoPSC. The
stipulation is consistent in all material respects with UE’s application filed
in December 2004. The MoPSC is expected to issue an order by the end of
March 2005. The transmission arrangements to allow for UE to serve Noranda are
subject to FERC approval. In February 2005, the MJMEUC filed a protest at the
FERC as to UE’s filing made in January 2005 to amend the Interchange Agreeement.
In its protest, the MJMEUC recommended that the FERC approve UE’s proposed
amendment, but requested that the FERC condition its approval on UE being
required to comply, after the fact, with the MISO Study Process. In early
March 2005, UE filed its response contending that the FERC should not
impose any conditions on the filing.  A decision by the FERC is expected in
late March 2005.

Illinois

Electric

In 2002, all of the Illinois residential, commercial and industrial customers of
UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP had a choice in electric suppliers under the provisions
of 1997 Illinois legislation related to the restructuring of the Illinois
electric industry (the Illinois Customer Choice Law).

Under the
Illinois Customer Choice Law, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP rates initially were frozen
through January 1, 2005.

Due to an
amendment to the Illinois Customer Choice Law, the rate freeze was extended
through January 1, 2007. As a result of this extension, and pursuant to orders
of the ICC, CIPS and Marketing Company and CILCO and AERG extended their
respective power supply agreements through December 31, 2006.

See Note
14 - Related Party Transactions for a discussion of these affiliate power supply
agreements.


The Illinois Customer Choice Law contains a provision requiring that half of
excess earnings from the Illinois jurisdiction for the years 1998 through 2006
be refunded to UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s Illinois customers. Excess earnings
are defined by the Illinois Customer Choice Law as the portion of the two-year
average annual rate of return on common equity in excess of 1.5% of the two-year
average of the Index. The Index is defined as the sum of the average for the 12
months ended September 30 of the average monthly yields of the Treasury
long-term average plus 7% for both UE and CIPS, 11% for CILCO and 8.5% for IP.
Estimated refunds totaling less than $1 million to UE’s Illinois customers are
expected to be made during the period from April 1, 2004, through March 31,
2005, resulting from excess earnings during the year ended December 31, 2003. No
refunds to CIPS’, CILCO’s or IP’s Illinois customers are expected to be made
during that period.

On
December 31, 2006, the current Illinois electric rate freeze expires, as do
supply contracts for generation to serve the power requirements of CIPS, CILCO
and IP expire. Prior to December 31, 2006, determinations must be made as to how
all Illinois distribution companies will procure their generation needs and how
they will set future rates for the generation components and delivery service
components of customer rates.

During
2004, the ICC conducted workshops to seek input from interested parties on the
framework for retail electric rate determination and generation procurement
after the current Illinois electric rate freeze and supply contracts expire on
December 31, 2006. A report issued by the ICC in late 2004 outlines a process
that received strong support in the workshops: It would have CIPS, CILCO and IP
procure power through an auction monitored by the ICC. The form of power supply
would meet the full requirements of the utility and the risk of fluctuations in
power requirements would be borne by the supplier. In addition, the report noted
that many stakeholders, including Ameren, supported a process whereby the price
of power resulting from the auction would be the price used to determine the
generation component of customer rates. This purchased power would be charged to
customers through a pass-through mechanism. With regard to the delivery service
component of customer rates, it is expected that all Illinois delivery service
companies will file rate cases, at which time the delivery service component of
customer rates will be updated. Genco and AERG would probably participate in the
auction, but there may be a limit imposed by the ICC on the maximum amount of
power they could supply CIPS, CILCO and IP. In February 2005, CIPS, CILCO and IP
filed with the ICC a proposed format for the generation procurement auction, a
rate mechanism to pass generation costs through to customers, and a process to
update the delivery service portion of rates, among other things. These
proposals are subject to review and approval by the ICC within eleven months of
the filings. In addition, the Illinois legislature began hearings regarding the
framework for retail rate determination and generation procurement in February
2005. We cannot predict what actions, if any, the Illinois legislature will
take, or whether the ICC will approve our proposals for generation procurement
or electric rate determination.

Gas

In June
2004, IP filed with the ICC seeking authority to raise its natural gas delivery
rates. In supplemental testimony, IP revised its requested rate increase to $25
million annually. The ICC staff in its rebuttal testimony recommended an
increase in rates of $10.5 million. In January 2005, IP and the other parties in
the proceeding submitted a partial settlement. If approved by the ICC, it will
permit a rate increase of $11 million to $14 million. Issues relating to the
proposed disallowance of costs associated with IP’s Hillsboro storage field were
not resolved by the parties’ settlement; they were the subject of hearings held
in January 2005. By law, the ICC is required to issue its decision about the
partial settlement and the contested issues by May 2005. In the order approving
Ameren’s acquisition of IP, the ICC prohibits IP from filing for any proposed
increase in gas delivery rates to be effective prior to January 1, 2007, beyond
IP’s pending request for a gas delivery rate increase. The ICC staff has
proposed a disallowance of $7.6 millions part of IP’s 2003 PGA reconciliation
proceeding related to the Hillsboro storage field.

In
October 2003, the ICC issued orders awarding CILCO, CIPS and UE increases in
annual natural gas delivery rates of $9 million, $7 million and $2 million,
respectively. These new rates went into effect in November 2003.

Federal

Regional
Transmission Organization

In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, which required all utilities
subject to the FERC jurisdiction to state their intentions for joining a RTO.
The MoPSC issued an order in early 2004 authorizing UE to participate in the
MISO for a five-year period, with participation after that period subject to
further approvals by the MoPSC. Subsequently, the FERC issued a final order
allowing UE’s and CIPS’ participation in the MISO. Under these orders, the MoPSC
continues to set the transmission component of UE’s rates to serve its bundled
retail load. CILCO was already a member of the MISO; it transferred functional
control of its transmission system to the MISO prior to our acquisition of
CILCO. Genco does not own transmission assets, but pays the MISO to use the
transmission system to transmit power from the Genco generating plants.


On May 1, 2004, functional control, but not ownership, of UE’s and CIPS’
transmission systems was transferred to the MISO through GridAmerica LLC. On
September 30, 2004, prior to the completion of Ameren’s acquisition of IP as
required by the FERC’s order approving the acquisition, IP transferred
functional control, but not ownership, of its transmission system to the MISO.
The transfers had no accounting impact on UE, CIPS and IP because they continue
to own the transmission system assets. The participation by UE, CIPS and IP in
the MISO is expected to increase annual costs by $10 million to $25 million in
the aggregate. This could also result in a decrease in annual revenues of
between $5 million and $15 million in the aggregate, depending upon the MISO’s
tariff structure. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP may also be required to expand their
transmission systems according to decisions made by the MISO rather than
according to their internal planning process.

As a part
of the transfer of functional control of UE’s and CIPS’ transmission systems to
the MISO, Ameren received $26 million, which represented the refund of the $13
million exit fee paid by UE and the $5 million exit fee paid by CIPS, both of
which were expensed when they left the MISO in 2001, plus $1 million interest on
the exit fees and the reimbursement of $7 million that was invested in the
proposed Alliance RTO. These refunds resulted in after-tax gains of $11 million,
$8 million, and $3 million for Ameren, UE, and CIPS, respectively, which were
recorded in other operations and maintenance expenses during the quarter ended
June 30, 2004. As part of the transfer of functional control of IP’s
transmission system to the MISO at the end of September 2004, IP also received a
refund of its MISO exit fee, plus interest on the exit fee, and RTO development
costs resulting in after-tax gains of $9 million during the quarter ended
September 30, 2004.

During
late 2003 and early 2004, the FERC had ordered the elimination of regional
through-and-out rates assessed by the MISO on transmission service between the
MISO and PJM regions, to be effective May 1, 2004. However, in March 2004, the
FERC accepted an agreement among affected transmission owners that retained the
regional through-and-out rates until December 1, 2004. It also provided for
continued negotiations aimed at developing a long-term transmission pricing
structure based on specified principles to eliminate seams between the PJM and
the MISO regions. In November 2004, the FERC announced that it had approved the
new pricing structure to eliminate the seams between the MISO and PJM. The new
rate structure applies for a fixed period ending January 31, 2008, and is based
on the “license plate” rate design currently in place in both the MISO and PJM,
under which payment of a single fee applicable to the transmission pricing zone
in which the transmission customer’s load is located entitles that customer to
transmission service over the entire combined system. However, to avoid an
abrupt cost shift as a result of the elimination of pancaked rates between the
MISO and PJM, the FERC also ordered the adoption of Seams Elimination Cost
Adjustments (SECA). In late November 2004, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP made SECA
filings with the FERC. Numerous comments were filed in January 2005. In February
2005, the FERC accepted for filing the SECA filings submitted in the proceeding
to become effective December 1, 2004, subject to refund and surcharge as
appropriate, and it established hearing procedures. Until the SECA filings have
finally been approved by the FERC, we cannot predict the ultimate impact that
such rate structure will have on UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s costs and
revenues.

In March 2004, the MISO tendered for filing at the FERC a proposed Open Access
Transmission and Energy Markets Tariff (the Energy Markets Tariff), which is
intended to supersede its existing OATT. The Energy Markets Tariff establishes
rates, terms and conditions necessary for implementation of a centralized
economic dispatch platform, including locational marginal-cost pricing and FTRs
for transmission service within the MISO region. The Energy Markets Tariff also
establishes market monitoring and mitigation procedures and codifies existing
resource adequacy requirements placed on the MISO members by their states or
applicable RRO. The MISO initially proposed to make the Energy Markets Tariff
effective on December 1, 2004, subject to its ability to implement the Energy
Markets Tariff. However, implementation of the Energy Markets Tariff is now
expected to be effective on April 1, 2005. On August 6, 2004, the FERC accepted
the MISO’s Energy Markets Tariff, subject to further compliance filings. On
November 8, 2004, the FERC issued an order denying the requests for rehearing
that were filed by a number of the MISO stakeholders including Ameren. However,
a final order from the FERC on the compliance filings made by the MISO in
response to the FERC’s August 6 order is still pending. At this time, Ameren is
unable to determine the full impact that the Energy Markets Tariff will have
until further information is available regarding the implementation of the
Energy Markets Tariff.

Until UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP achieve some degree of operational experience
participating in the MISO, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that
such participation or ongoing RTO developments at the FERC or other regulatory
authorities will have on our results of operations, financial position, or
liquidity.

Hydroelectric
License Renewal

In November 2004, the FERC formally accepted UE’s February 2004 license renewal
application, and it solicited terms and conditions from the U.S. Department of
Interior and various state agencies to renew the license for its Osage
hydroelectric plant for an additional 50-year term. The current FERC license
expires on February 28, 2006. The license application proposes to continue
operations at the Osage


plant as
a peaking facility, to upgrade four turbine units, and to maximize the
hydroelectric capacity of the plant.

New
Market Power Analysis Screen Order

In an order issued in April 2004, the FERC replaced the Supply Margin Assessment
Screen previously used to review the applications by sellers of electricity at
wholesale for authorization to sell power at market-based rates. The new system
uses two alternative measures of market power: (1) a pivotal supplier analysis
and (2) a market share analysis, which is to be prepared on a seasonal basis.
Applicants located in a RTO with sufficient market structure and a single energy
market were permitted to base these measures of market power on the size of the
market in the geographic region under the control of the RTO. Other applicants
were required to base these measures of market power on the size of the market
in the control area in which they operate. If the applicant passes both screens,
a rebuttable presumption will exist that it lacks generation market power. If
the applicant fails either screen, a rebuttable presumption will exist that it
has market power. Under such circumstances, the applicant may either seek to
rebut the presumption by preparing a delivered price test (identifying the
amount of economic capacity from neighboring areas that can be delivered to the
control area) or propose mitigation measures. Unless some other mitigation
measure is adopted, the applicant’s authority to sell power at market-based
rates in areas where it has market power will be revoked, and the applicant will
be required to sell at cost-based rates in those areas.

UE, Genco, CIPS, CILCO, AERG, Development Company, Marketing Company, and Medina
Valley currently have authorization from the FERC to sell power at market-based
rates. As required, these Ameren companies filed an updated market power
analysis with the FERC in December 2004. All of the Ameren companies pass both
screen measures for the market consisting of the entire MISO footprint. In their
December filing, they wrote that because MISO’s Day Two Markets, at such date,
were scheduled to begin March 1, 2005, the MISO footprint was the only relevant
market for measuring whether any of the Ameren companies possess market power as
defined by the FERC. Also in their December filing, they offered to submit
supplemental information that applies the new tests to smaller markets
consisting of the control areas in which the Ameren companies sell power, if the
MISO Day Two Markets did not begin on March 1, 2005, as originally scheduled. In
January 2005, the effective date of the MISO Day Two was moved to April 1, 2005;
however, with only a one-month delay, we still believe that applying the new
screens on the basis of the entire MISO footprint is inappropriate. In January
2005, the Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission (MJMEUC) filed a
protest to our December filing. The MJMEUC is an association of Missouri
municipal customers, that purchase transmission service from Ameren. In its
protest, the MJMEUC contends that the Ameren companies have not shown they lack
market power, that the MISO footprint is not the relevant market, and that the
MISO's energy markets will not be sufficient to protect consumers from market
power abuses, especially with respect to long-term markets. In February 2005,
the Ameren companies filed a response to the MJMEUC’s protest, responding to
each of these claims. We are unable to anticipate how or when the FERC will
respond to our December filing and to any supplemental filing. Therefore, we are
unable to predict the ultimate impact the new screens will have on our ability
to sell power at market-based rates.

Regulatory

(a)

Excludes
      amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004;
      includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant subsidiaries and
      intercompany eliminations.

(b)

CILCORP
      consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances.

(c)

      amounts represent predecessor information.

(d)

Amount
      represents SFAS No. 109 deferred tax asset. See Note 13 - Income Taxes for
      amortization period.

(e)

These
      assets do not earn a return.

(f)

Represents
      recoverable costs for asset retirement obligations at our rate-regulated
      operations. See SFAS No. 143 discussion in Note 1 - Summary of Significant
      Accounting Policies.

(g)

Represents
      UE’s Callaway nuclear plant operations and maintenance expenses, property
      taxes, and carrying costs incurred between the plant in-service date and
      the date the plant was reflected in rates. These costs are being amortized
      over the remaining life of the plant’s current operating license through
      2024.

(h)

Represents
      losses related to repaid debt. These amounts are being amortized over the
      lives of the related new debt issues or the remaining lives of the old
      debt issues if no new debt was issued.

(i)

Represents
      the recoverable portion of accrued environmental site liabilities
      primarily collected from electric and gas customers through ICC approved
      revenue riders in Illinois.

(j)

Represents
      reorganization costs related to the integration of IP into the Ameren
      system and the restructuring of IP. Per the ICC order approving Ameren’s
      acquisition of IP, these costs are recoverable over four years after 2006
      through rates.

(k)

Represents
      a portion of IP’s unamortized debt fair value adjustment recorded upon
      Ameren’s acquisition of IP at September 30, 2004. This portion will be
      amortized over the remaining life of the related debt upon expiration of
      the electric rate freeze in Illinois in
2006.

(l)

Represents
      Y2K expenses being amortized over six years starting in 2002, in
      conjunction with the 2002 settlement of UE’s Missouri electric rate case
      and a DOE decommissioning assessment being amortized over 14 years through
      2007. In addition, this amount includes the portion of merger-related
      expenses applicable to the Missouri retail jurisdiction, which are being
      amortized through 2007 based on a MoPSC order.

(m)

Represents
      unamortized portion of investment tax credit and federal excess taxes. See
      Note 13 - Income Taxes for amortization period.

(n)

Represents
      estimated funds collected for the eventual dismantling and removing plant
      from service, net of salvage value, upon retirement related to our
      rate-regulated operations. See SFAS No. 143 discussion in Note 1 - Summary
      of Significant Accounting Policies.

(o)

Represents
      potentially noncompetitive investment costs (stranded costs) that IP was
      allowed to recover from retail customers during the transition period
      (until December 31, 2006) through frozen bundled rates and transition
      charges from customers who select other electric suppliers.

(p)

Represents
      ICC-allowed decommissioning costs associated with IP’s former nuclear
      plant. The regulatory asset for the probable future collections from rate
      payers of decommissioning costs was amortized as the decommissioning costs
      are collected. See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies for further
      discussion.

UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP continually assess the recoverability of their regulatory
assets. Under current accounting standards, regulatory assets are written off to
earnings when it is no longer probable that such amounts will be recovered
through future revenues. Electric industry restructuring legislation may affect
the recoverability of electric regulatory assets in the future.

IP’s predecessor financial statements included a cost-recovery asset related to
the recovery of certain stranded costs during the Illinois Customer Choice Law
transition period, which extends until December 31, 2006. IP had recorded a
regulatory asset of $341 million in 1998 for the portion of its stranded costs
it expected to recover during the transition period. The transition-period
cost-recovery asset amortization reflected in IP’s predecessor statement of
income was $29 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2004, $39
million in 2003, and $71 million in 2002. No value was assigned to the
transition-period cost-recovery asset in the allocation of the purchase price
for IP upon the acquisition by Ameren on September 30, 2004. See Note 2 -
Acquisitions for more information regarding the purchase price
allocation.

      represents predecessor information.

At December 31,
2004, certain of the Ameren Companies had committed bank credit facilities
totaling $1,164 million, $789 million of which was available for use, subject to
applicable regulatory short-term borrowing authorizations, by UE, CIPS, CILCO,
IP, and Ameren Services through a utility money pool arrangement. At December
31, 2004, UE had $375 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, which
reduced the available amounts under these facilities. All of the $789 million
was available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short-term borrowing
authorizations, by Ameren directly, by CILCORP through direct short-term
borrowings from Ameren, and by most of the non-rate-regulated subsidiaries
including, but not limited to, Resources Company, Genco, Marketing Company,
AFS,


AERG, and
Ameren Energy, through a non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool agreement.
Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries to coordinate
and provide for certain short-term cash and working capital requirements.
Separate money pools are maintained between rate-regulated and
non-rate-regulated entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement
exists between Ameren, IP and Ameren Services, which enables IP to make
short-term borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings
outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the
utility money agreement, together with any outstanding external short-term
borrowings by IP, may not exceed $500 million pursuant to authorizations from
the ICC and the SEC under the PUHCA. Ameren Services is responsible for
operation and administration of the agreements. See Note 14 - Related Party
Transactions for a detailed explanation of the money pool arrangements and the
unilateral borrowing agreement. The committed bank credit facilities are used to
support our commercial paper programs under which $375 million was outstanding
for Ameren on a consolidated basis at December 31, 2004 (2003 - $150 million).
Access to our credit facilities for all Ameren Companies is subject to reduction
based on use by affiliates.

In April 2004, UE renewed, for an additional one-year term, its $75 million
364-day committed credit facility, which is to be used for general corporate
purposes, including support of its commercial paper program. This facility makes
borrowings available at various interest rates based on London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR), agreed rates, and other options. CIPS, CILCO and IP can access
this facility through the utility money pool agreement.

In July
2004, Ameren entered into two new revolving credit facilities totaling $700
million to be used for general corporate purposes, including support of Ameren
and UE commercial paper programs. The $700 million in new facilities includes a
$350 million three-year revolving credit facility and a $350 million five-year
revolving credit facility. These new credit facilities replaced Ameren’s
existing $235 million 364-day revolving credit facility, which matured in July
2004, and a $130 million multiyear revolving credit facility, which would have
matured in July 2005. In September 2004, an existing Ameren $235 million
multiyear revolving facility, which matures in July 2006, was amended and
restated to accommodate Ameren’s acquisition of IP and to conform with the two
credit facilities entered into in July 2004.

EEI has two bank credit agreements totaling $45 million with maturities through
June 2005. At December 31, 2004,

$7
million was available under these committed credit facilities.

Borrowings
under Ameren’s non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool agreement by Genco,
Development Company, and Medina Valley, each an “exempt wholesale generator,”
are considered investments for purposes of the 50% SEC aggregate investment
limitation. Based on Ameren’s aggregate investment in these “exempt wholesale
generators” as of December 31, 2004, the maximum permissible borrowings under
Ameren’s non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool pursuant to this limitation
for these entities totaled $507 million.

Indebtedness
Provisions and Other Covenants

Certain
of the Ameren Companies’ bank credit agreements contain provisions which, among
other things, place restrictions on the ability to incur liens, sell assets, and
merge with other entities. Certain of these credit agreements also contain a
provision that limits Ameren’s, UE’s, CIPS’ and CILCO’s total indebtedness to
60% of total capitalization pursuant to a calculation defined in the agreement.
Exceeding these debt levels would result in a default under the credit
arrangements. As of December 31, 2004, the ratio of total indebtedness to total
capitalization (calculated in accordance with this provision) for Ameren, UE,
CIPS and CILCO was 50%, 44%, 53% and 43%, respectively (2003 - 52%, 44%, 54%,
53%). From and after March 31, 2005, IP’s total indebtedness will also be
limited by this provision. In addition, certain of these credit agreements
contain indebtedness cross-default provisions and material adverse change
clauses that could trigger a default under these facilities in the event that
any of Ameren’s subsidiaries (subject to the definition in the underlying credit
agreements), other than certain project finance subsidiaries, defaults in
indebtedness in excess of $50 million. The credit agreements also require us to
meet minimum ERISA funding rules.

None of
the Ameren Companies’ credit agreements or financing arrangements contain credit
rating triggers. One of EEI’s credit agreements contains a credit rating trigger
under which a default can occur in the event any of the sponsor’s (as defined in
the credit agreements) credit rating falls below Baa3 or BBB- by Moody’s and
S&P and the sponsor does not cover a payment default. A $100 million CILCO
bank term loan containing a credit rating trigger was repaid in February 2004.
At December 31, 2004, the Ameren Companies and EEI were in compliance with their
credit agreement provisions and covenants

Ameren

In
February 2004, Ameren issued, pursuant to an August 2002 SEC Form S-3 shelf
registration statement, 19.1 million shares of its common stock at $45.90 per
share, for net proceeds of $853 million. This issuance substantially depleted
all of the capacity under the August 2002 shelf registration statement. In June
2004, the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 shelf registration statement filed
by Ameren and its subsidiary trusts covering the offering from time to time of
up to $2 billion of various types of securities, including long-term debt, trust
preferred securities, and equity securities. In July 2004, Ameren issued,
pursuant to the June 2004 Form S-3 shelf registration statement, 10.9 million
shares of its common stock at $42.00 per share, for net proceeds of $445
million. The proceeds from both of these offerings were used to pay the cash
portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of IP and Dynegy's 20%
interest in EEI and, as described below under IP, to reduce IP debt assumed as
part of the acquisition and to pay related premiums.

The
purchase of IP on September 30, 2004, included the assumption of IP debt and
preferred stock at closing of $1.8 billion. The assumed debt and preferred stock
included $936 million of mortgage bonds, $509 million of pollution control
indebtedness supported by mortgage bonds, $352 million of TFNs issued by IP SPT,
and $13 million of preferred stock not acquired and owned by Ameren. Upon
acquisition, total IP debt was increased to fair value by $191 million. The
adjustment to the fair value of each debt series is being amortized over its
remaining life, or to the expected redemption date, to interest expense.

In March
2004, the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 registration statement filed by
Ameren in February 2004, authorizing the offering of 6 million additional shares
of its common stock under DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are,
at Ameren’s option, newly issued shares or treasury shares, or shares purchased
in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently
selling newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus. In December 2001,
Ameren began issuing new shares of common stock in connection with certain of
our 401(k) plans pursuant to effective Form S-8 registration statement.
Under DRPlus and our 401(k) plans, Ameren issued a total of 2.3 million shares
of common stock in 2004 valued at

$107
million. Under the DRPlus and our 401(k) plans, Ameren issued 2.5 million and
2.3 million shares of common stock in 2003 and 2002, respectively, which were
valued at

$105
million and $93 million for the respective years.

In March
2002, Ameren issued $345 million of adjustable conversion-rate equity security
units and $227 million (gross proceeds) of common stock (5 million shares at
$39.50 per share and 750,000 shares, pursuant to the exercise of an option
granted to the underwriters, at $38.865 per share). The $25 adjustable
conversion-rate equity security units each consisted of an Ameren senior
unsecured note with a principal amount of $25 and a contract to purchase, for
$25, a fraction of a share of Ameren common stock on May 15, 2005. The senior
unsecured notes were recorded at their fair value of $345 million and will
mature on May 15, 2007. Total distributions on the equity security units were
originally made at an annual rate of 9.75%, consisting of quarterly interest
payments on the senior unsecured notes at the initial annual rate of 5.20% and
contract adjustment payments under the stock purchase contracts at the annual
rate of 4.55%. In February 2005, the annual interest rate on $375 million
principal amount of Ameren’s senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2007, was reset
from 5.20% to 4.263%. The stock purchase contracts require holders to purchase
8.7 million to 7.4 million shares of Ameren common stock on May 15, 2005, at the
market price at that time, subject to a minimum share purchase price of $39.50
and a maximum of $46.61. The stock purchase contracts included a pledge of the
related senior unsecured notes as collateral for the stock purchase obligation.
As a result of the February 2005 remarketing of the senior unsecured notes,
treasury securities were substituted for the senior unsecured notes and are
currently pledged as collateral for the stock purchase obligation and the senior
unsecured notes were released from the pledge. In 2002, we recorded the net
present value of the stock purchase contract adjustment payments of $46 million
as an increase in Other Deferred Credits and Liabilities to reflect our
obligation and a decrease in Other Paid-in Capital to reflect the fair value of
the stock purchase contract. The liability for the stock purchase contract
adjustment payments (December 31, 2004 - $6 million; December 31, 2003 - $21
million) will be reduced as such payments are made through May 15, 2005.

As
discussed above, in February 2005, the annual interest rate on the $345 million
principal amount of Ameren’s senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2007 was reset
from 5.20% to 4.263%. These senior unsecured notes were originally issued in
March 2002 as a component of Ameren’s publicly traded adjustable conversion-rate
equity security units. As required by the original terms of the agreement, the
interest rate was reset because Ameren remarketed these senior unsecured notes.
The proceeds from the remarketing of the senior unsecured notes were used by the
former holders of the adjustable conversion-rate equity security units to
purchase treasury securities to secure their obligations to purchase Ameren
common stock pursuant to the stock purchase contracts in May 2005. As part of
this remarketing, Ameren also repurchased $95 million in principal amount of the
senior unsecured notes; it has subsequently retired these notes.

UE

In 2004, UE received a capital contribution from Ameren totaling $16 million, as
a result of an allocation of income tax benefit in 2004 and 2003, pursuant to
the tax-allocation agreement among the Ameren Companies.


UE had a lease agreement, scheduled to expire on August 31, 2031, that provided
for the financing of a portion of its nuclear fuel that was processed for use or
was consumed at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant. In February 2004, UE terminated
this lease with a final payment of $67 million made in January
2004.

In
February and March 2004, in connection with the delivery of bond insurance
policies to secure the environmental improvement and pollution control revenue
bonds (Series 1991, 1992, 1998A, 1998B, 1998C, 2000A, 2000B and 2000C)
previously issued by the Missouri Environmental Authority, UE delivered separate
series of its first mortgage bonds (which are subject to fallaway provisions, as
defined in the related financing agreements, similar to those included in its
first mortgage bonds that secure UE’s senior secured notes) to secure its
respective obligations under the existing loan agreements with the Missouri
Environmental Authority relating to such environmental improvement and pollution
control revenue bonds. As a result, the environmental improvement and pollution
control revenue bonds were rated Aaa, AAA, and AAA by Moody’s, S&P, and
Fitch, respectively.

In May
2004, UE issued, pursuant to its September 2003 SEC Form S-3 shelf registration
statement, $104 million of 5.50% senior secured notes due May 15, 2014, with
interest payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year beginning
in November 2004. UE received net proceeds of $103 million, which were used to
redeem its $100 million 7.00% first mortgage bonds due 2024.

In
September 2004, UE issued, pursuant to its September 2003 SEC Form S-3 shelf
registration statement, $300 million of 5.10% senior secured notes due October
1, 2019, with interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each
year beginning in April 2005. UE received net proceeds of $298 million, which
were used to repay short-term debt temporarily incurred to fund the maturity of
UE’s $188 million 6.875% first mortgage bonds on August 1, 2004, and to repay
other short-term debt, which consisted of borrowings under the utility money
pool arrangement.

In
January 2005, UE issued, pursuant to its September 2003 SEC Form S-3 shelf
registration statement, $85 million of 5.00% senior secured notes due February
1, 2020, with interest payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each
year beginning in August 2005. UE received net proceeds of $83 million, which
were used to repay short-term debt temporarily incurred to fund the maturity of
UE’s $85 million 7.375% 2004 first mortgage bonds.

In December 2002, upon receipt of all necessary federal and state regulatory
approvals, UE, pursuant to Missouri economic development statutes, conveyed most
of its Peno Creek CT facility to the city of Bowling Green, Missouri in exchange
for the issuance by the city of a taxable industrial development revenue bond in
the amount of $103 million. Concurrently, the city leased back the facility to
UE for a term of 20 years. The lease term is the same as the final maturity of
the bond purchased by UE. Although the lease is a capital lease, no capital was
raised in the transaction. UE is responsible for making rental payments under
the lease in an amount sufficient to pay the debt service of the bond. The
city's ownership of the facility during the term of the bond and the lease will
result in property tax savings to UE. Under the terms of the lease, UE retains
all operation and maintenance responsibilities for the facility and ownership of
the facility is returned to UE at the expiration of the lease.

CIPS

In
November 2004, CIPS issued, through the Illinois Finance Authority, $35 million
of Series 2004 environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds due in 2025,
currently in a variable-rate Dutch auction interest rate mode. These bonds are
insured by a bond insurance policy and secured by first mortgage bonds (which
are subject to fallaway provisions, as defined in the related financing
agreements, similar to those which secure CIPS’ senior secured notes). As a
result, the environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds were rated Aaa,
AAA, and AAA by Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch, respectively. The proceeds received
from the issuance of the $35 million Series 2004 bonds were used to redeem, at
par, CIPS’ $35 million 6.375% 1993 Series A due 2028 pollution-control revenue
bonds.

In
December 2004, CIPS redeemed prior to maturity,

$18
million of its 5.90% 1993 Series B-2 pollution control bonds due 2028 and $17
million of its $25 million 5.70% 1993 Series C-2 pollution control bonds due
2026. These redemptions were made with available cash and borrowings from the
utility money pool agreement.

Ameren, UE and CIPS may sell all, or a portion of, the remaining securities
registered under their open SEC registration statements if market conditions and
capital requirements warrant. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a
prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and its rules
and regulations.

CILCORP

In
conjunction with Ameren’s acquisition of CILCORP, CILCORP’s long-term debt was
recorded at fair value. This resulted in recognition of fair-value adjustment
increases of $71 million related to CILCORP’s 9.375% senior bonds due 2029 and
$40 million related to its 8.70% senior notes due 2009. Amortization related to
these fair value adjustments was $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
(2003 - $7 million), and was included in interest expense in the


Consolidated
Statements of Income of Ameren and CILCORP.

In May
2004, CILCORP repurchased $15 million in principal amount of its 9.375% senior
bonds. In July 2004, it repurchased an additional $2 million in principal amount
of these bonds. In conjunction with these debt repurchases, the fair-value
adjustment on these bonds was reduced by

$5
million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

CILCO

In
February 2004, CILCO repaid its secured bank term loan totaling $100 million
with borrowings from the utility money pool agreement.

In
November 2004, CILCO issued, through the Illinois Finance Authority, $19 million
of Series 2004 environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds due in 2039,
currently in a variable-rate Dutch auction interest rate mode. These bonds are
insured by a bond insurance policy and are secured by first mortgage bonds
(which are subject to fallaway provisions, as defined in the related financing
agreements, similar to those included in the first mortgage bonds which secure
UE’s and CIPS' senior secured notes). As a result, the environmental improvement
revenue refunding bonds were rated Aaa, AAA, and AAA by Moody’s, S&P, and
Fitch, respectively. The Series 2004 bonds are subject to a mandatory sinking
fund redemption totaling $5 million at par on October 1, 2026, with the
remainder of $14 million in principal amount due October 1, 2039. The proceeds
received from the issuance were used to redeem CILCO’s $14 million 6.50% Series
1992 A due 2018 and $5 million 6.50% Series 1992 C due 2010 pollution control
revenue bonds.

IP

In
conjunction with Ameren’s acquisition of IP, IP’s long-term debt was increased
to fair value by $195 million. Amortization related to fair-value
adjustments was

$14
million for the year ended December 31, 2004

(2003 -
$1 million) and was included in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements
of Income of Ameren and IP.

In
November 2004, pursuant to an equity clawback provision in the related bond
indenture, IP redeemed

$192.5
million principal amount of its 11.50% Series mortgage bonds due 2010. The
redemption price was equal to $1,115 per $1,000 principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Also in November 2004, IP completed
a cash tender offer for $351 million of these bonds. The tender offer
consideration paid was $1,214 per $1,000 principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the settlement date. This tender offer satisfied IP’s
indenture obligation to offer to purchase the bonds resulting from the change of
control of IP upon its acquisition by Ameren. In December 2004, IP repurchased
an additional $6.5 million principal amount of these bonds at a redemption price
of $1,207 per $1000 principal amount plus accrued unpaid interest. At December
31, 2004, only $33,000 principal amount of these bonds remained
outstanding.

In
December 2004, IP redeemed $66 million principal amount of its 7.50% Series
mortgage bonds due 2025 at a redemption price of 103.105% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest and $84 million in principal amount of its 7.40%
Series 1994 B pollution control bonds due 2024 at a redemption price of 102% of
the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. This indebtedness, along
with the redemption and repurchase of the 11.50% Series mortgage bonds due 2010
described above, were funded by IP through equity contributions made by Ameren
in the fourth quarter of 2004 totaling $871 million. In conjunction with these
debt repurchases, the fair value adjustment on IP’s long-term debt was reduced
by $103 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

In
December 1998, the IP SPT issued $864 million of TFNs as allowed under the
Illinois Electric Utility Transition Funding Law. In accordance with the
Transitional Funding Securitization Financing Agreement, IP must designate a
portion of the cash received from customer billings to fund payment of the TFNs.
The amounts received are remitted to the IP SPT and are restricted for the sole
purpose of paying down the TFNs. Due to the adoption of FIN No. 46R and
resulting deconsolidation of IP SPT, certain amounts of restricted cash are
netted against the current portion of IP’s long-term debt payable to IP SPT on
IP’s December 31, 2004 and 2003, consolidated balance sheets.

In
September 1999, IP entered into an operating lease on four gas turbines located
in Tilton, Illinois and a separate land lease at the Tilton site. IP sublet the
turbines to a predecessor of DMG in October 1999.

In July
2004, subsequent to the expiration of a statutory notice period after a filing
at the ICC, IP terminated its lease with the original lessor.

DMG then
executed a transfer agreement under which the original lessor sold the turbine
assets to DMG for the full contract price of $81 million. Additionally, IP
assigned its associated land lease on the Tilton site to a predecessor of DMG.
For additional information relating to the Tilton capital lease and related
asset retirement obligation liability and remeasurement, see Note 1 - Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies.

EEI

In June
2004, EEI repaid its $40 million bank term loan at maturity with proceeds
received from EEI’s credit facilities.


In
December 2004, EEI repaid $6 million of its 8.60% medium-term notes and $8
million of its 6.61% medium-term notes with proceeds received from EEI’s credit
facilities.

Indenture
Provisions and Other Covenants

UE

UE’s
indenture agreements and articles of incorporation include covenants and
provisions related to the issuances of first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.
For the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds, earnings coverage of twice
the annual interest charges on first mortgage bonds outstanding and to be issued
is required. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, UE had a coverage ratio
of 8.2 times the annual interest charges on the first mortgage bonds
outstanding, which would permit UE to issue an additional $3.7 billion of first
mortgage bonds at an assumed interest rate of 7%. For the issuance of additional
preferred stock, earnings coverage of at least 2.5 times the annual dividend on
preferred stock outstanding and to be issued is required under UE’s articles of
incorporation. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, UE had a coverage
ratio of 63 times the annual dividend requirement on preferred stock
outstanding, which would permit UE to issue an additional $2 billion in
preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of 7%. The ability to issue such
securities in the future will depend on such tests at that time.

In
addition, UE’s mortgage indenture contains certain provisions that restrict the
amount of common dividends that can be paid by UE. Under this mortgage
indenture, $31 million of total retained earnings was restricted against payment
of common dividends, except those dividends payable in common stock, which left
$1.7 billion of free and unrestricted retained earnings at December 31, 2004.

CIPS

CIPS’ indenture agreements and articles of incorporation include covenants that
must be complied with before first mortgage bonds and preferred stock are
issued. For the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds, earnings coverage
of twice the annual interest charges on first mortgage bonds outstanding and to
be issued is required, except in certain cases when additional first mortgage
bonds are issued on the basis of retired bonds. For the 12 months ended December
31, 2004, CIPS had a coverage ratio of 3.1 times the annual interest charges for
one year on the aggregate amount of bonds outstanding. Consequently, the most
restrictive test under the indenture agreements would allow CIPS to issue an
additional $134 million of first mortgage bonds, assuming an interest rate of
7%. For the issuance of additional preferred stock, earnings coverage of 1.5
times annual interest charges on all long-term debt and the annual preferred
stock dividends is required under CIPS’ articles of incorporation. For the 12
months ended December 31, 2004, CIPS had a coverage ratio of 2.1 times the sum
of the annual interest charges and dividend requirements on all long-term debt
and preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2004, and consequently had
the availability to issue an additional $182 million of preferred stock,
assuming a dividend rate of 7%. The ability to issue such securities in the
future will depend on such coverage ratios at that time.

Genco

Genco’s
senior note indenture includes provisions that require it to maintain a senior
debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.75 to 1 (for both the prior four
fiscal quarters and for the succeeding four six-month periods) in order to pay
dividends or to make payments of principal or interest under certain
subordinated indebtedness, excluding amounts payable under its intercompany note
payable to CIPS. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, this ratio was 5.0
to 1. In addition, the indenture also restricts Genco from incurring any
additional indebtedness, with the exception of certain permitted indebtedness
defined in the indenture, unless its senior debt service coverage ratio equals
at least 2.5 to 1 for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters and its
senior debt to total capital ratio would not exceed 60% - both after giving
effect to the additional indebtedness on a pro-forma basis. This debt incurrence
restriction is to be disregarded if both Moody’s and S&P reaffirm the
ratings of Genco in place at the time of debt incurrence after considering the
additional indebtedness. As of December 31, 2004, Genco’s senior debt to total
capital ratio was 53%.

CILCORP

Covenants
in CILCORP's indenture governing its

$475
million (original issuance amount) senior notes and bonds require CILCORP to
maintain a debt-to-capital ratio no greater than 0.67 to 1 and an interest
coverage ratio of at least 2.2 to 1 in order to make any payment of dividends or
intercompany loans to affiliates other than to its direct and indirect
subsidiaries, including CILCO. However, in the event CILCORP is not in
compliance with these tests, CILCORP may make such payments of dividends or
intercompany loans if its senior long-term debt rating is at least BB+ from
S&P, Baa2 from Moody’s, and BBB from Fitch. For the 12 months ended December
31, 2004, CILCORP's debt-to-capital ratio was 0.58 to 1 and its interest
coverage ratio was 2.3 to 1, calculated in accordance with applicable provisions
of this indenture. At December 31, 2004, CILCORP’s senior long-term debt ratings
from S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch were BBB+, Baa2, and BBB+, respectively. The
common stock of CILCO is pledged as security to the holders of these senior
notes and bonds.

CILCO

CILCO’s
indenture agreement and articles of incorporation include covenants that must be
compiled with before CILCO may issue first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.
For the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds, an


earnings
coverage of twice the annual interest requirements on first mortgage bonds
outstanding and to be issued, or earnings of at least 12% of the principal
amount of all bonds

outstanding
and to be issued is required, except in certain cases when additional first
mortgage bonds are issued on the basis of retired bonds. For the 12 months ended
December 31, 2004, CILCO had an earnings coverage ratio of 7.5 times the annual
interest charges for one year on the aggregate amount of bonds outstanding or at
least 53% of the principal amount of all mortgage bonds outstanding under the
mortgage. Accordingly, the most restrictive test under the indenture agreement
would allow CILCO to issue an additional $47 million of first mortgage bonds.
For the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock, the articles of
incorporation would allow CILCO to issue an additional

$47
million of first mortgage bonds. For the issuance of additional shares of
preferred stock, the articles of incorporation provide that no class of shares
with rights superior to the currently issued preferred stock as to payment of
dividends or as to assets shall be issued, unless the net income available for
the payment of the dividends for a period of 12 consecutive calendar months
within the 15 months immediately preceding the issuance shall be at least

2 ½ times
the annual dividend requirements of all then-outstanding shares of preferred
stock. Consequently, the most restrictive test under which CILCO could issue
additional shares of preferred stock would allow CILCO to issue additional
preferred stock in the amount of $155 million.

IP

IP’s
indenture agreements and articles of incorporation include covenants and
provisions related to the issuance of first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.
For the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds based on property additions,
earnings coverage of twice the annual interest charges on first mortgage bonds
outstanding and to be issued is required. For the 12 months ended December 31,
2004, IP had a coverage ratio of 1.88 times the annual interest charges on the
first mortgage bonds outstanding, which would not permit IP to issue any
additional first mortgage bonds based on property additions. However, as of
December 31, 2004, IP had the ability to issue $1.3 billion of bonds based upon
retired bond capacity, for which no earnings coverage test is required. For the
issuance of additional preferred stock, earnings coverage of at least 1.5 times
the annual dividend on preferred stock outstanding and to be issued is required
under IP’s articles of incorporation. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004,
IP had a coverage ratio of 1.37 times the annual dividend requirement on
preferred stock outstanding, which would not permit IP to issue any additional
preferred stock. The ability to issue such securities in the future will depend
on such tests at that time.

The IP
SPT TFNs contain restrictions that prohibit IP LLC from making any loan or
advance to, or certain investments in, any other person. Also, as long as the
TFNs are outstanding, the IP SPT shall not, directly or indirectly, pay any
dividend or make any distribution (by reduction of capital or otherwise) to any
owner of a beneficial interest in the IP SPT.

See Note
3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for restrictions on IP’s ability to declare and
pay common stock dividends imposed by the ICC order approving Ameren’s
acquisition of IP.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

At
December 31, 2004, none of the Ameren Companies had any off-balance sheet
financing arrangements, other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary
course of business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any
significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements in the near
future.

NOTE
7 -

RESTRUCTURING
CHARGES AND OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS

Ameren
and UE recorded a pretax coal contract settlement gain of $51 million in 2003.
This gain represented a return of coal costs plus accrued interest accumulated
by a coal supplier for reclamation of a coal mine that supplied a UE power
plant. UE entered into a settlement agreement with the coal supplier to return
the accumulated reclamation funds, which were paid to UE ratably through
December 2004.

CILCO
recorded $2 million and $21 million in acquisition integration costs in 2004 and
2003, respectively. The 2004 costs primarily represented severance and
relocation amounts. The 2003 costs represented write-offs of software without
future benefit as of the acquisition date ($13 million), severance and
relocation costs ($5 million), and an increase in the bad debt reserve related
to one customer for which there was significant collection concern at the
acquisition date ($3 million). These amounts were offset against goodwill at
CILCORP through purchase accounting and, therefore, there was no impact to
Ameren’s Consolidated Statement of Income.

Ameren recorded voluntary employee retirement and other restructuring charges of
$92 million in 2002. These charges included a voluntary retirement program
charge of $75 million based on voluntary retirements of approximately 550
employees. Of the $75 million charge, UE recorded

$51
million, CIPS recorded $14 million, Genco recorded

$8
million, and other Ameren companies recorded $2 million. These charges related
primarily to special termination benefits associated with our pension and
postretirement benefit plans. Most of the employees who voluntarily retired
accepted retirement in 2002 and left Ameren in early 2003.

In addition, in 2002, Ameren recorded a charge of

$17
million primarily associated with the retirement of 343 megawatts of
rate-regulated generating capacity at UE’s Venice, Illinois plant and temporary
suspension of operations of two coal-fired generating units (126 megawatts) at
Genco’s Meredosia, Illinois plant.

NOTE
9 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We use
derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for
natural gas, fuel, electricity and emission credits. Price fluctuations in
natural gas, fuel, and electricity cause:

·

an
      unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our firm commitments to
      purchase or sell when purchase or sale prices under the firm commitment
      are compared with current commodity prices;

·

market
      values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power to differ
      from the cost of those commodities in inventory under firm commitment; and

·

actual
      cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities to differ from
      anticipated cash outlays.

The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are approved by risk management
policies that control the use of forward contracts, futures, options and swaps.
Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging
programs to determine if new or offsetting transactions are required. The goal
of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring
sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements.

Certain derivative contracts are entered into on a regular basis as part of our
risk management program but do not qualify for hedge accounting or the normal
purchase and sale exceptions under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. Accordingly, these contracts
are recorded at fair value with changes in the fair value charged or credited to
the income statement in the period in which the change occurred. Contracts we
enter into as part of our risk management program may be settled financially, by
physical delivery, or net settled with the counterparty.

Cash
Flow Hedges

Our risk management processes identify the relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and
strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The mark-to-market value of
cash flow hedges will continue to fluctuate with changes in market prices up to
contract expiration.

We monitor and value derivative positions daily as part of our risk management
processes. We use published sources for pricing when possible to mark positions
to market. We rely on modeled valuations only when no other method
exists.

The
following table presents balances in certain accounts for cash flow hedges as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003:

      2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant
      subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.

(b)

Represents
      the mark-to-market value for the hedged portion of electricity price
      exposure for periods generally less than one year. Certain contracts
      designated as hedges of electricity price exposure have terms up to three
      years.

(c)

Represents
      a gain associated with interest rate swaps at Genco that were a partial
      hedge of the interest rate on debt issued in June 2002. The swaps cover
      the first 10 years of debt that has a 30-year maturity and the gain in OCI
      is amortized over a 10-year period that began in June
  2002.

(d)

Represents
      a gain associated with natural gas swaps and futures contracts. The swaps
      are a partial hedge of our natural gas requirements through March 2008.

(e)

Represents
      the mark-to-market gain of two call options to purchase coal that are
      accounted for as cash flow hedges. One of these options to purchase coal
      expired in October 2003 and the other option expires in July 2005.

The
pretax net gain or loss on power forward derivative instruments included in
Other Income and (Deductions) at Ameren, UE and Genco, which represents the
impact of discontinued cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of cash flow
hedges, and the reversal of amounts previously recorded in OCI due to
transactions going to delivery or settlement, was less than $1 million loss for
Ameren, UE and Genco for the year ended December 31, 2004 (2003 - less than a $1
million loss for Ameren, UE, and Genco).

Other
Derivatives

The
following table represents the net change in market value of option
transactions, which are used to manage our positions in SO


allowances, coal, heating oil, and electricity or power. Certain of these
transactions are treated as nonhedge transactions under SFAS No. 133. The net
change in the market value of SO


options
is recorded in Operating Revenues - Electric, while the net change in the market
value of coal, heating oil and electricity or power options is recorded as
Operating Expenses - Fuel and Purchased Power.

Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been
granted FTRs associated with the advent of the MISO Day Two Market. Marketing
Company has been granted FTRs for its participation in the PJM-Com Ed market. We
sought and received FTRs with the intent to hedge (offset) congestion charges
related to our physical electricity business. Depending on the congestion on the
transmission grid and prices at various points on the grid, FTRs could result in
either charges or credits. We use complex grid modeling tools to determine which
FTRs we wish to nominate in the FTR allocation process. There is risk that we
may incorrectly model the amount of FTRs we need, and there is the potential
that some of the FTR hedges could be ineffective.


NOTE

STOCKHOLDER
RIGHTS PLAN AND PREFERRED STOCK

Stockholder
Rights Plan

Ameren’s
board of directors has adopted a share purchase rights plan designed to assure
stockholders of fair and equal treatment in the event of a proposed takeover.
The rights are exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15% or more of
Ameren’s outstanding common stock or announces a tender offer, which would
result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the Ameren common
stock. Each right will entitle the holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a
newly issued preferred stock at an exercise price of $180. If a person or group
acquires 15% or more of Ameren’s outstanding common stock, each right will
entitle its holder (other than such person or members of such group) to
purchase, at the right’s then-current exercise price, a number of Ameren’s
common shares having a market value of twice such price. In addition, if Ameren
is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person
or group has acquired 15% or more of Ameren’s outstanding common stock, each
right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right’s then-current exercise
price, a number of the acquiring company’s common shares having a market value
of twice such price. The acquiring person or group will not be entitled to
exercise these rights. These rights expire in 2008. One right will accompany
each new share of Ameren common stock prior to such expiration
date.

Preferred
Stock

All
classes of UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s preferred stock are entitled to
cumulative dividends and have voting rights. Ameren has 100 million shares of
$0.01 par value preferred stock authorized, with no shares outstanding. CIPS has
2.6 million shares of no par value preferred stock authorized, with no shares
outstanding. UE has 7.5 million shares authorized of $1 par value preference
stock and CILCO has 2 million shares authorized of no par value preference
stock, with no such preference stock outstanding. IP has 5 million shares
authorized of no par value serial preferred stock and 5 million shares
authorized of no par value preference stock, with no such serial preferred stock
and preference stock outstanding. No shares of preference stock have been issued
by any of the Ameren Companies.

The following table presents the outstanding preferred stock of UE, CIPS, CILCO
and IP that is not subject to mandatory redemption and is entitled to cumulative
dividends and is redeemable, at the option of the issuer, at the prices

RETIREMENT BENEFITS

We have
defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all
employees of UE, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP, EEI and Ameren Services and certain
employees of Resources Company and its subsidiaries, including Genco. Ameren
uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and postretirement
benefit plans.

IP merged
into the Ameren pension and postretirement plans during the fourth quarter of
2004. Previously, IP had been part of the Dynegy benefit plans, so the IP
predecessor amounts below represent the components of IP’s participation in the
Dynegy plans prior to Ameren’s acquisition of IP. Plan participants included not
only employees of IP, but certain Illinova and DMG employees. IP was reimbursed
by participating Dynegy subsidiaries for their respective shares of the expenses
of these benefit plans. Effective with Ameren’s acquisition of IP, employees of
the other Dynegy subsidiaries were not transferred into the Ameren plans and,
therefore, are not included in successor information presented.

Investment
Strategy and Return on Asset Assumption

The
primary objective of the Ameren Retirement Plan and postretirement benefit plans
is to provide eligible employees with pension and postretirement health care
benefits. Ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the “prudent investor”
guidelines contained in the ERISA. Ameren’s goal is to earn the highest possible
return on plan assets consistent with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates
investment management to specialists in each asset class. Where appropriate,
Ameren provides the investment manager with specific guidelines that specify
allowable and prohibited investment types. Ameren regularly monitors manager
performance and compliance with investment guidelines.

The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of
return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio.
Assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after an
analysis of historical experience and future expectations of the returns and the
volatility of the various asset classes. Depending on the target asset
allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the
portfolio was adjusted for historical and expected experience of active
portfolio management results compared to benchmark returns and for the effect of
expenses paid from plan assets.

Pension

Pension
benefits are based on the employees’ years of service and compensation. Our
plans are funded in compliance with income tax regulations and federal funding
requirements.


The following table presents the cash contributions made to our defined benefit
retirement plan qualified trusts

during
2004 and 2003. The current-year contribution provided cost savings to us by
eliminating the need to pay a portion of insurance premiums to the Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation.

A minimum
pension liability was recorded at December 31, 2002, which resulted in an
after-tax charge to OCI and a reduction in stockholders’ equity of $102 million.
In 2003, the minimum pension liability was reduced, resulting in OCI of $46
million and an increase in stockholders’ equity. In 2004, the minimum pension
liability was increased, resulting in a charge to OCI of $6 million and a
decrease in stockholders’ equity.

Based on our assumptions at December 31, 2004, we expect to be required under
ERISA to fund an aggregate of $400 million for the period of 2005 to 2009, in
order to maintain minimum funding levels for our pension plan with no minimum
contribution required until 2008, assuming continuation of the current interest
rate relief beyond 2005. We expect UE’s, CIPS’, Genco’s, CILCO’s, and IP’s
portion of the future funding requirements to be approximately 50%, 9%, 9%, 11%,
and 21%, respectively. These amounts are estimates and may change with actual
stock market performance, changes in interest rates, any pertinent changes in
government regulations, and any prior voluntary contributions.

Employee Beneficiary Association trusts (VEBA) to match the annual
postretirement expense.

The
following table presents the cash contributions made to our postretirement plan
during 2004. We made cash contributions of $70 million in 2003, excluding

Ameren
adopted FSP SFAS 106-2 during the second quarter of 2004, retroactive to January
1, 2004, which resulted in the recognition of a federal subsidy for
postretirement benefit costs related to prescription drug benefits. See Note 1 -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The effect of this subsidy was a
reduction of various components of Ameren’s and principally UE’s net periodic
postretirement benefit costs. Interest costs were reduced by $4 million and
amortization of losses were reduced by $7 million. The impact of the subsidy on
the expected return on plan assets was minimal.

UE, CIPS,
Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP are responsible for their proportional share of the
postretirement benefit costs. The following table presents the postretirement
benefit costs for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

Ameren
and CIPS sponsor 401(k) plans for eligible employees. An IP plan was merged into
the Ameren plan during the fourth quarter of 2004. The CILCO plan was merged
into the Ameren plan at the beginning of 2004. The plans allow employees to
contribute a portion of their base pay in accordance with specific guidelines.
Ameren, CIPS and IP (predecessor) match a percentage of the employee
contributions up to certain limits. Ameren’s and IP’s matching contributions to
the 401(k) plans totaled $15 million and $2 million (predecessor), respectively,
in 2004. Matching contributions to the Ameren, previous IP, and previous CILCO
plans were $14 million, $2 million, and $1 million, respectively, in each of the
years 2003 and 2002. CIPS’ matching contributions to its 401(k) plan were less
than $1 million annually in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

NOTE

-

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION

Ameren
has a long-term incentive plan for eligible employees called the Long-term
Incentive Plan of 1998, which provides for the grant of options, performance
awards

,
restricted stock,

dividend
equivalents, and stock appreciation rights. Restricted stock awards were granted
in 2004, 2003 and 2002 as a component of our compensation programs. We applied
APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for our stock-based compensation for years
prior to 2003. There have not been any stock options granted since December 31,
2000. Effective January 1, 2003, we prospectively adopted accounting for our
stock-based compensation plans using the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for
further information.

Restricted
Stock

Restricted
stock awards in Ameren common stock may be granted under our long-term incentive
plan. Upon the achievement of certain performance levels, the
restricted


stock
award vests over a period of seven years, beginning at the date of grant, and
includes provisions requiring certain stock ownership

levels

based on
position

and

salary.
An accelerated vesting provision included in this plan reduces the vesting
period from seven years to three years. During 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively, 135,340, 152,956, and 154,678 restricted stock awards were
granted. The weighted-average fair value for restricted stock awards granted in
2004, 2003, and 2002 was $46.34, $39.74, and $42.50 per share, respectively. We
record unearned compensation (as a component of stockholders’ equity) equal to
the market value of the restricted stock on the date of grant and charge the
unearned compensation to expense over the vesting period.

Stock
Options

Ameren

Options
in Ameren common stock may be granted under our long-term incentive plan at a
price not less than the fair-market value of the common shares at the date of
grant. Granted options

vest over
a period of five years

,
beginning at the date of grant, and provide for accelerated exercising upon the
occurrence of certain events, including retirement. Outstanding options

expire on
various dates through 2010

. Subject
to adjustment, 4 million shares have been authorized to be issued or delivered
under our long-term incentive plan. In accordance with APB Opinion No.

, no
compensation expense was recognized related to our stock

options
for 2004, 2003 and 2002

.

CILCORP

Prior to
Ameren’s acquisition of CILCORP, employees of CILCORP and CILCO participated in
the AES Stock Option Plan that provided for grants of AES common stock options
to eligible participants. Under the terms of the plan, options were issued to
purchase shares of AES common stock at a price equal to 100% of the market price
at the date the option was granted. The


options became eligible for exercise under various
schedules. The following table presents CILCORP stock option activity during

Ameren Companies have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, affiliate
transactions in the normal course of business. These transactions primarily
consist of gas and power purchases and sales, services received or rendered, and
borrowings and lendings. Transactions between affiliates are reported as
intercompany transactions on their financial statements, but are eliminated in
consolidation for Ameren’s

financial statements. Below are the material related-party agreements.

Electric
Power Supply Agreements

Under two electric power supply agreements, Genco is obliged to supply to
Marketing Company, and Marketing Company, in turn, is obliged to supply to CIPS
with all of the energy and capacity CIPS needs to offer service for resale to


its
native load customers at ICC-related rates and to fulfill its other obligations
under all applicable federal and state tariffs or contracts. Any power not used
by CIPS is sold by Marketing Company under various long-term wholesale and
retail contracts. For native load, CIPS pays an annual capacity charge per
megawatt (the greater of its forecasted peak demand or actual demand), plus an
energy charge per megawatthour to Marketing Company. For fixed-price retail
customers outside of the tariff, CIPS pays Marketing Company the price it
receives under these contracts. The fees paid by CIPS to Marketing Company for
native load and fixed-price retail customers and any other sales by Marketing
Company under various long-term wholesale and retail contracts are passed
through to Genco. In addition, under the power supply agreement between Genco
and Marketing Company, Genco bears all generation-related operating risks,
including plant performance, operations, maintenance, efficiency, employee
retention, and other matters. There are no guarantees, bargain purchase options,
or other terms that may convey to CIPS the right to use the property and plant
of Genco. The expiration date for the agreement between CIPS and Marketing
Company has been extended to December 31, 2006. The agreement between Genco and
Marketing Company can be terminated by either party upon one year’s notice. This
extension was required by the ICC in its order approving Ameren’s acquisition of
CILCORP and CILCO.

In October 2003, in conjunction with CILCO’s transfer to AERG of substantially
all of its generating assets, AERG entered into an electric power supply
agreement to supply CILCO with sufficient power to meet its native load
requirements. CILCO pays a monthly capacity charge per megawatt based on its
system capacity requirements, plus an energy charge per megawatthour. The
expiration date for this agreement has been extended to December 31, 2006. The
ICC required this extension in its order approving Ameren’s acquisition of
CILCORP and CILCO. Also in conjunction with CILCO’s generating asset transfer, a
bilateral power supply agreement was entered into between AERG and Marketing
Company. This agreement provides for AERG to sell excess power to Marketing
Company for sales outside the CILCO control area, and it also allows Marketing
Company to sell power to AERG to fulfill CILCO’s native load requirements.

CILCO had
an agreement with CIPS for the purchase of 100 megawatts of capacity and firm
energy for the months of January and June through September under a contract
that commenced in January 2000 and expired in September 2003. This power was
supplied by Genco through the Marketing Company, CIPS, and Genco electric power
supply agreements discussed above.

UE, CIPS,
IP and a nonaffiliated company are parties to a power supply agreement with EEI
to purchase and sell capacity and energy. This agreement expires on December 31,
2005. Under a separate agreement that expires on December 31, 2005, CIPS resold
its entitlements under the power supply agreement with EEI to Marketing Company.
Marketing Company and certain nonaffiliated companies are parties to a power
supply agreement with Midwest Electric Power, Inc., a subsidiary of EEI, to
purchase capacity and energy. This agreement’s term is year to year on a
calendar basis unless the purchasing parties unanimously agree to terminate
their participation.

UE has a
150-megawatt power supply agreement with Marketing Company that expires December
31, 2005. UE also had a one-year 450-megawatt power supply agreement with
Marketing Company that expired in May 2002 and another one-year 200 megawatt
power supply agreement with Marketing Company that expired in May 2003. Power
supplied by Marketing Company to UE through these agreements is being obtained
from Genco.

In December 2003, the SEC approved an agency agreement between AERG and
Marketing Company that authorizes Marketing Company, on behalf of AERG, to sell
AERG’s excess generation or to purchase power needed to supply AERG
customers.

In December 2004, Marketing Company and IP entered into an agency agreement that
authorizes Marketing Company, on behalf of IP, to sell or purchase, as
necessary, electric energy and capacity in the wholesale market for 2005 and
2006.

IP had a contract with a former affiliate, DMG, to supply power via purchase
agreements that expired at the end of 2004. The purchased power agreement with
DMG obliged DMG to provide power to IP up to the reservation amount, and at the
same prices, even if DMG had individual units unavailable at various
times.

IP is party to several commercial and industrial electric and gas sales
agreements with DMG, which were entered into prior to Ameren’s acquisition of
IP. These are typically yearly contracts that renew automatically unless
cancelled by either party pursuant to a 30-day written notice.

Also prior to Ameren’s acquisition, IP purchased natural gas from Dynegy to
serve its gas distribution business under a Gas Industry Standards Board master
base contract that terminated October 1, 2004. Under this agreement, IP executed
multiple transactions in 2002 and 2003 that covered deliveries for the yearly
winter peak season from November through March. One transaction was executed in
2004 to provide deliveries from January to March 2004.

Interconnection
and Transmission Agreements

UE, CIPS and IP are parties to an interconnection agreement for the use of their
respective transmission lines and other facilities for the distribution of
power. In addition, CILCO and IP are parties to a similar interconnection
agreement. These agreements have no contractual expiration


date but may be terminated by either party with three years
notice.

IP is party to transmission and interconnection sales agreements with DYPM,
a former affiliate, for the use of IP’s transmission lines and other
facilities. The transmission sale agreements expire in April and June 2005. The
interconnection sales agreements expire January 1, 2006. On October 1, 2004,
pursuant to the sale of IP to Ameren, all continuing contracts with Dynegy and
its affiliates became third-party agreements.

Joint
Dispatch Agreement

UE and
Genco jointly dispatch electric generation under a joint dispatch agreement
among UE, Genco and CIPS. Under the agreement, each affiliate is permitted to
use the cheapest generation available first, whether it be from UE or Genco.
Each affiliate has the option to serve its load requirements from its own
generation first, and then to allow access to any available generation to its
affiliate. The joint dispatch agreement can be terminated by either party upon
one year’s notice. In an order approving the transfer of UE’s Illinois-based
utility businesses to CIPS (see Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters), the MoPSC
ordered UE to amend the joint dispatch agreement so that margins on short-term
power sales will be determined by generation output as opposed to load. This
will provide UE with a larger share of the margins on short-term sales of power
from the combined generation of UE and Genco. Such an amendment is expected to
provide to UE with additional annual margins ranging from $7 million to $24
million for UE’s share of short-term power sales. Such an amendment is expected
to result in a corresponding reduction in Genco’s margins from its share of
short-term power sales. However, this reduction is expected to be mitigated by
margins received from additional power sales by Genco (through Marketing
Company) to CIPS to serve the transferred UE Illinois-based electric utility
business through the end of 2006 under the current power supply contracts.

The
termination of the joint dispatch agreement, or modifications to it, could have
a material effect on Ameren, UE or Genco. Modifications to or termination of the
agreement would not have an immediate impact on Ameren because of UE’s Missouri
electric rate moratorium, which ends June 30, 2006.

Any
excess generation not used by UE or Genco through the joint dispatch agreement
is sold to third parties through Ameren Energy, serving as each affiliate’s
agent. Ameren Energy also acts as agent on behalf of UE and Genco to purchase
power when they require it.

Support
Services Agreements

Costs of support services provided by Ameren Services, Ameren Energy, and AFS to
their affiliates, including wages, employee benefits, professional services, and
other expenses are based on, or are an allocation of, actual costs incurred.
Effective September 30, 2004, IP was added to the support services agreements
with Ameren Services and AFS.

Prior to
this, IP operated under Dynegy’s consolidated group’s Services and Facilities
Agreement, whereby other Dynegy affiliates exchanged with IP services such as
financial, legal, information technology, and human resources, as well as shared
facility space. IP services were exchanged at fully distributed costs and
revenues were not recorded under this agreement. This agreement was terminated
in conjunction with IP’s sale to Ameren.

Executory
Tolling, Gas Sales, and Transportation Agreements

Under an
executory tolling agreement, CILCO purchases steam, chilled water, and
electricity from Medina Valley. In connection with this agreement, Medina Valley
purchases gas to fuel its generating facility from AFS under a fuel supply and
services agreement. Prior to September 2003, Medina Valley purchased gas from
CILCORP Energy Services, Inc., a subsidiary of CILCORP that operated gas
management services including commodity procurement and redelivery to retail
customers, and gas transportation from CILCO.

Under a
gas transportation agreement, Genco acquires gas transportation service from UE
for its Columbia, Missouri CTs. This agreement expires in February
2016.

Notes
Receivable from Former Affiliate

At December 31, 2004, there was no principal outstanding under IP’s $2.3 billion
Note Receivable from Former Affiliate, as it was eliminated in connection with
the sale of all of IP’s common stock and approximately 73% of its preferred
stock to Ameren.

Due to
the prepayments described below, IP had no accrued interest at December 31, 2004
or 2003.

In July,
September, October and December 2003, Dynegy made interest payments totaling
$256 million on its $2.3 billion intercompany note payable to Illinova, which in
turn made interest payments totaling $256 million to IP under the Note
Receivable from Former Affiliate. These interest payments represented accrued
interest on the notes for the months of April through December 2003 and prepaid
interest for the months of January 2004 through September 2004. In January 2004,
IP received an additional interest prepayment of $43 million. These notes
contained payment provisions pursuant to which semi-annual interest payments of
$86 million were due on April 1 and October 1 of each year. See Note 2 -
Acquisitions for further information.


Transitional
Funding Securitization Financing Agreement

IP's financial statements include related-party transactions with the IP SPT,
its wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary, which was deconsolidated in
accordance with the adoption of FIN No. 46R effective on December 31, 2003.

In
accordance with the Transitional Funding Securitization Financing Agreement, IP
must designate a portion of the cash received from customer billings to fund
payment of the TFNs. The amounts received are remitted to the IP SPT and are
restricted for the sole purpose of paying down the TFNs. Due to the adoption of
FIN No. 46R and resulting deconsolidation of IP SPT, these amounts are
netted against the current portion of IP’s long-term debt payable to IP SPT on
IP’s December 31, 2004 consolidated balance sheet. See Note 1 - Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies for further information.

Money
Pools

Utility

UE, CIPS,
CILCO and IP have the ability to borrow from Ameren and from each other through
a utility money pool agreement. Ameren Services administers the utility money
pool and tracks internal and external funds separately. Ameren Services also
participates in the utility money pool. Ameren and AERG may participate in the
utility money pool only as lenders. Internal funds are surplus funds contributed
to the utility money pool from participants. The primary source of external
funds for the utility money pool is the UE commercial paper program. Through the
utility money pool, the pool participants can access committed credit facilities
at Ameren that totaled $935 million at December 31, 2004. These facilities are
in addition to UE’s $154 million, CIPS’ $15 million, and CILCO’s $60 million in
committed credit facilities, which are also available to the utility money pool
participants. Based on outstanding UE commercial paper borrowings at December
31, 2004, $789 million was available for borrowing under Ameren credit
facilities through the utility money pool agreement. The total amount available
to the pool participants from the utility money pool at any given time is
reduced by the amount of borrowings by their affiliates, but increased to the
extent the pool participants have surplus funds or other external sources are
used to increase the available amounts. The availability of funds is also
determined by funding requirement limits established by the SEC under the PUHCA.
UE, CIPS, CILCO, IP and Ameren Services rely on the utility money pool to
coordinate and provide for certain short-term cash and working capital
requirements. Borrowers receiving a loan under the utility money pool agreement
must repay the principal amount of such loan, together with accrued interest.
The rate of interest depends on the composition of internal and external funds
in the utility money pool. The average interest rate for borrowing under the
utility money pool for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 1.38% (2003 -
1.14%).

On
September 30, 2004, in conjunction with the completion on that date of Ameren’s
acquisition of IP, a unilateral borrowing agreement was entered into between
Ameren, IP, and Ameren Services that enables IP to make short-term borrowings
directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time
by IP under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money pool
agreement, together with any short-term borrowings by IP, may not exceed $500
million, pursuant to authorization from the ICC and the SEC under the PUHCA.
Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of the
agreement. At December 31, 2004, IP had loaned $140 million to the utility money
pool.

Non-state-regulated
subsidiaries

Genco and
other non-state-regulated Ameren subsidiaries have the ability to borrow up to
$935 million in total from Ameren through a non-state-regulated subsidiary money
pool agreement. However, the total amount available to the pool participants at
any time is reduced by the amount of borrowings from Ameren by its subsidiaries
and is increased to the extent that other pool participants advance surplus
funds to the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool or external sources are
used to increase the available amounts. At December 31, 2004, $789 million was
available through the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool, excluding
additional funds available through excess cash balances. The non-state-regulated
subsidiary money pool was established to coordinate and provide for short-term
cash and working capital requirements of Ameren’s non-state-regulated
activities. It is administered by Ameren Services.

Borrowers
receiving a loan under the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool agreement
must repay the principal amount of such loan, together with accrued interest.

The rate
of interest depends on the composition of internal and external funds in the
non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool. These rates are based on the cost of
funds used for money pool advances. Ameren and CILCORP are authorized to act
only as lenders to the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool. In October
2003, AERG received the required regulatory approval necessary to participate in
the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool.

The
average interest rate for borrowing under the non-state-regulated subsidiary
money pool for year ended December 31, 2004 was 8.84% (2003 -
8.84%).

CILCORP
has been granted authority by the SEC under the PUHCA to borrow up to $250
million directly from Ameren in a separate arrangement unrelated to the money
pools. At December 31, 2004, CILCORP had notes payable under this agreement of
$72 million (2003 - $46 million) at an average interest rate of 8.84% for the
year ended December 31, 2004.


Intercompany
Promissory Notes

As of December 31, 2004, Genco has affiliate notes payable of $249 million and
$34 million to CIPS and Ameren, respectively, which, by their current terms,
have final payments of principal and interest due on May 1, 2005. These notes
bear interest at 7%. In November 2004, Genco made a $75 million principal
prepayment under its note payable to CIPS. The note payable
to CIPS was issued in conjunction with the transfer of its
electric generating assets and related liabilities to Genco. Genco and CIPS plan
to renew or modify the CIPS note to extend the principal maturity to May 1,
2010, which is expected to include continued amortization of the principal
amount. Genco and Ameren are currently evaluating various alternatives with
respect to the note payable to Ameren. In the event the maturities of these
notes are not extended or restructured, Genco may need to access other financing
sources to meet the maturity obligation to the extent it does not have cash
available from its operating cash flows. Such sources of financing could include
borrowings under the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool, or infusion of
equity capital or new direct borrowings from Ameren, all subject to applicable
regulatory financing authorizations and provisions in Genco’s senior note
indenture.

Operating
Leases

Under an
operating lease agreement, Genco is leasing certain CTs at a Joppa, Illinois
site to its parent, Development Company for a minimum term of 15 years, expiring
September 30, 2015. Under an electric power supply agreement with Marketing
Company, Development Company supplies the capacity and energy from these leased
units to Marketing Company, which in turn supplies the energy to
Genco.

In
September 1999, IP entered into an operating lease on four gas turbines located
in Tilton, Illinois and a separate land lease at the Tilton site. IP sublet the
turbines to its former affiliate, DMG, in October 1999.

In July
2004, subsequent to the expiration of a statutory notice period after a filing
at the ICC, IP terminated its lease with the original lessor.

DMG then
executed a transfer agreement under which the original lessor sold the turbine
assets to DMG for the full contract price of $81 million. Additionally, IP
assigned its associated land lease on the Tilton site to DMG. For IP, the Tilton
lease was a complete pass-through, with no revenue or expense to IP, as DMG made
all of the payments on IP's behalf. The receivable from DMG was offset by a
corresponding payable to the lessor. For additional information relating to the
Tilton capital lease and related asset retirement obligation liability and
remeasurement, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES

As a
result of issues generated in the course of daily business, we are involved in
legal, tax and regulatory proceedings before various courts, regulatory
commissions, and governmental agencies, some of which involve substantial
amounts of money. We believe that the final disposition of these proceedings,
except as otherwise disclosed in these notes to our financial statements, will
not have an adverse material effect on our results of operations,

financial
position or liquidity.

Capital
Expenditures

See Note
3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for information regarding Ameren’s capital
expenditure commitment with respect to IP, which was included in the ICC order
approving Ameren’s acquisition of IP, as well as for information regarding
Ameren’s and UE’s capital expenditure commitments, which were agreed upon in
relation to UE’s 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement and UE’s 2003
Missouri gas rate case settlement. Additionally, UE’s future estimated capital
expenditures include the addition of new CTs with approximately 330 megawatts of
capacity at its Venice, Illinois plant site by the end of 2005. Total costs
expected to be incurred for these units are $125 million, of which $82 million
was committed as of December 31, 2004.

      Act of 1954, as amended (Price-Anderson). This

is
      subject to retrospective assessment with respect to loss from an incident
      at any U.S. reactor, payable at $10 million per year. Price-Anderson
      expired in August 2002 and the temporary extension expired December 31,
      2003. Until Price-Anderson is renewed, its provisions continue to apply to
      existing nuclear plants.

Weekly
      indemnity of $4.5 million for 52 weeks, which commences after the first
      eight weeks of an outage, plus $3.6 million per week for 71.1 weeks
      thereafter.

Price-Anderson
limits the liability for claims from an incident involving any licensed U.S.
nuclear facility. The limit is based on the number of licensed reactors and is
adjusted at least every five years to reflect changes in the

Consumer
Price Index. Utilities owning a nuclear reactor cover this exposure through a
combination of private insurance and mandatory participation in a financial
protection pool, as established by Price-Anderson.

If losses
from a nuclear incident at the Callaway nuclear plant exceed the limits of, or
are not subject to, insurance, or if coverage is not available, we self-insure
the risk. Although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident,
if one did occur, it could have a material but indeterminable adverse effect on
our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

      the Less than 1 Year, 1 - 3 Years and 3 - 5 Years columns. Amounts for
      After 5 Years are not included in the total amount due to the indefinite
      periods. Ameren’s estimated obligation for after five years is $1 million
      annually for both the real estate leases and the railroad
      licenses.

We lease various facilities, office equipment, plant equipment, and rail cars
under operating leases. We also have a capital lease relating to UE’s Peno Creek
CT facility. We also had a capital lease relating to nuclear fuel for UE’s
Callaway nuclear plant, which was terminated early in February 2004. See Note 6
- - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings for further information on this nuclear
fuel lease. In September 1999, IP entered into an operating lease on four gas
turbines located in Tilton, Illinois and a separate land lease at the Tilton
site. IP sublet the turbines to a predecessor of DMG in October 1999.

In July
2004, subsequent to the expiration of a statutory notice period after a filing
at the ICC, IP terminated the lease with the original lessor.

DMG then
executed a transfer agreement under which the original lessor sold the turbine
assets to DMG for the full contract price of $81 million. Additionally, IP
assigned its associated land lease on the Tilton site to DMG. The following
table presents total rental expense, included in Other Operations and

IP paid the $5 million in remaining decommissioning obligations associated with
its former Clinton nuclear plant in December 2004. Other obligations also
include decontamination and decommissioning charges associated with IP’s use of
a DOE facility that enriched uranium for the Clinton nuclear plant. IP was
assessed an amount to be paid over 15 years that would be used by the DOE for
decontamination and decommissioning of its facility. The remaining obligation is
$2 million and the final payment is due in 2006.

Environmental
Matters

We are
subject to various environmental regulations by federal, state and local
authorities. From the beginning phases of siting and development to the ongoing
operation of existing or new electric generating, transmission and distribution
facilities, and natural gas storage plant, transmission and distribution
facilities, our activities involve compliance with diverse laws and regulations.
These address noise, emissions, and impacts to air and water, protected and
cultural resources (such as wetlands, endangered species, and
archeological/historical resources), chemical and waste handling. Our activities
often require complex and often lengthy processes as we obtain approvals,
permits or licenses for new, existing or modified facilities. Additionally, the
use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials (including wastes)
requires preparation of release prevention plans and emergency response
procedures. As new laws or regulations are promulgated, we assess their
applicability and implement the necessary modifications to our facilities or
their operations, as required. The more significant matters are discussed
below.

Clean
Air Act

The EPA
issued a rule in October 1998 that required 22 eastern states and the District
of Columbia to reduce emissions of NO

x

in order
to reduce ozone in the eastern United States. Among other things, the EPA’s rule
establishes an ozone season, which runs from May through September, and a
NO

x

emission
budget for each state, including Illinois. The EPA rule required states to
implement controls sufficient to meet their NO

x

budget
by May 31, 2004. In the spring of 2004, the EPA issued similar rules for
Missouri. The compliance date for the Missouri rules is May 1, 2007.

As a
result of these requirements, affected Ameren Companies have installed a variety
of NO

x

control
technologies on power plant boilers over the past several years. Ameren’s and
UE’s future estimated capital expenditures to comply with the final
NO

x

regulations in Missouri between 2005 and 2008 are $15 million to

$20
million.

In
mid-December 2003, the EPA issued proposed regulations with respect to
SO


and
NO

x

emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions from coal-fired
power plants. The new rules, if adopted, will require significant additional
reductions in these emissions from UE, Genco and CILCO power plants in phases,
beginning in 2010. The rules are currently under a public review and comment
period; they may change before being issued as final. We do not expect
regulations to be finalized until the first half of 2005. The following table
presents preliminary estimated capital costs based on current available
technology to comply with the

Clean Air
Interstate Rule and mercury

rules, as

IP and
DMG are the subject of a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA and a complaint
filed in 1999 by the United States in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of Illinois (Court) alleging violations of the Clean Air Act and
certain related federal and Illinois regulations. Similar notices and complaints
were filed against other owners of coal-fired power plants in what we refer to
as the Utility Enforcement Initiative. Both the NOV and the complaint allege
that certain equipment repairs, replacements, and maintenance activities at the
three Baldwin Power Station generating units, currently owned by DMG and
formerly owned by IP, constituted “major modifications” under the Prevention of
Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations, the New Source Performance Standard
(NSPS) regulations and the applicable Illinois regulations. It is further
alleged that the defendants failed to obtain required operating permits under
the applicable Illinois regulations. When activities meeting the definition of
“major modifications” occur, the Clean Air Act and related regulations generally
subject those activities to PSD review and permit requirements; the generating
facilities where the activities occur must meet more stringent emissions
standards, which may entail the installation of potentially costly pollution
control equipment.

Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement
covering Ameren’s acquisition of IP from Dynegy, Dynegy agreed to fully
indemnify Ameren and IP in the event of an adverse ruling and in any settlement
arising from or out of this litigation. To secure payment of the indemnification
obligations


of
Dynegy, Ameren, pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, has
deposited $100 million of the cash portion of the purchase price into an escrow
account with the funds to be released to Dynegy on the sooner of (1) December
31, 2010; (2) the date on which the senior unsecured debt of Dynegy Holdings
Inc., a Dynegy subsidiary, achieves an investment grade rating from S&P or
Moody’s; or (3) the occurrence of specified events relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with IP’s former generating facilities,
including the Baldwin Power Station.

DMG has entered into a comprehensive settlement with the
EPA, the U.S. and other intervening parties that resolves this litigation. 
The settlement agreement is set forth in a consent decree and resolves all
claims in the litigation as well as similar claims that may have been brought
with respect to other generation facilities owned by DMG and formerly owed by
IP.  If approved by the Court, this consent decree will relieve IP of any
civil liability under the Clear Air Act and related federal and Illinois
regulations with respect to IP's former ownership of the Baldwin Power Station
and other generation assets now owned by DMG.  The consent decree, upon its
approval by the Court, is also expected to satisfy the conditions for the
release to Dynegy of the $100 million of the IP purchase price that is held in
an escrow account as discussed above.

Multipollutant
Legislation

The
United States Congress has been working on legislation to consolidate the
numerous air pollution regulations facing the utility industry. Continued
deliberation on this “Clear Skies” legislation is expected in 2005. Our cost to
comply with such legislation, if it is enacted, is expected to be covered by the
modifications to our facilities required by combined mercury and Clean Air
Interstate rules described above.

Global
Climate

Future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global warming are the
subjects of much debate. As a result of our diverse fuel portfolio, our
contribution to greenhouse gases varies. Coal-fired power plants, however, are
significant sources of carbon dioxide emissions, a principal greenhouse gas. The
related Kyoto Protocol was signed by the United States but has since been
rejected by the president, who instead has asked for an 18% decrease in carbon
intensity on a voluntary basis. In response to the administration’s request, six
electric power sector trade associations, including the Edison Electric
Institute, of which Ameren is a member, and the Tennessee Valley Authority
signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the DOE in December 2004 calling
for a 3% - 5% decrease in carbon intensity from

the
utility sector between 2002 and 2012 on a voluntary basis. Currently, Ameren is
considering various initiatives to comply with the MOU, including enhanced
generation at our nuclear and hydro power plants, increased efficiency measures
at our coal-fired units, and investments in renewable energy and carbon
sequestration projects.

Ameren has already taken actions to address the global climate issue. These
include implementing efficiency improvements at our

power
plants; participating in the PowerTree Carbon Company, LLC, whose purpose is to
reforest acreage in the lower Mississippi valley to sequester carbon; using coal
combustion by-products as a direct replacement for cement, thereby reducing
carbon emissions at cement kilns;

participating
in "Missouri Schools Going Solar," a project that will install photovoltaic
solar arrays on school grounds; and partnering with other utilities, the
Electric Power Research Institute, and the Illinois Geological Survey in the DOE
Illinois Basin Initiative, which will examine methods and the feasibility of
storing carbon dioxide within deep, uneconomic coal seams, mature oil fields,
and saline reservoirs.

Future initiatives related to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming and
the ultimate effects of the Kyoto Protocol on us are unknown. Although
compliance costs are unlikely in the near future, our costs of complying with
any mandated federal greenhouse gas program could have a material impact on our
future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Clean
Water Act

In July
2004, the EPA issued rules under the Clean Water Act that require that cooling
water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing
adverse environmental impacts. These rules pertain to existing generating
facilities that currently employ a cooling water intake structure whose flow
exceeds 50 million gallons per day. The rules may require us to install
additional intake screens or other protective measures, and to do extensive
site-specific study and monitoring. There is also the possibility that the rules
may lead to the installation of cooling towers on some of our facilities. Our
compliance costs associated with conducting field studies and installing fish
collection systems to determine the aquatic impact of our intake structures will
be in the range of a few million dollars over the next few years. These studies
will determine what, if any, additional technology must be applied at nine of
our existing power plants. At this time, we are unable to estimate the costs of
complying with these rules. Such costs will not be incurred prior to
2008.


Remediation

We are
involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous waste sites as
required by federal and state law. Such statutes require that responsible
parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original
disposal, or ownership of a disposal site. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP have each been
identified by the federal or state governments as a potentially responsible
party at several contaminated sites. Several of these sites involve facilities
that were transferred by CIPS to Genco in May 2000 and were transferred by CILCO
to AERG in October 2003. As part of each transfer, the transferor (CIPS or
CILCO) has contractually agreed to indemnify the transferee (Genco or AERG) for
remediation costs associated with preexisting environmental contamination at the
transferred sites.

UE, CIPS,
CILCO, and IP own or are otherwise responsible for one, 13, four, and 25 former
MGP sites, respectively, in Illinois. All of these sites are in various stages
of investigation, evaluation and remediation. Under its current schedule, Ameren
anticipates that remediation at these sites should be completed by 2015. The ICC
permits each company to recover remediation and litigation costs associated with
their former MGP sites located in Illinois from their Illinois electric and
natural gas utility customers through environmental adjustment rate riders. To
be recoverable, such costs must be prudently and properly incurred; costs are
subject to annual reconciliation review by the ICC. The total costs deferred,
net of recoveries from insurers and through environmental adjustment rate
riders, at December 31, 2004, were $1 million, $25 million, $4 million, and $64
million for UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP, respectively.

In
addition, UE owns or is otherwise responsible for 10 MGP sites in Missouri and
one in Iowa. Unlike Illinois, UE does not have in effect in Missouri a rate
rider mechanism which permits remediation costs associated with MGP sites to be
recovered from utility customers. UE does not have any retail utility operations
in Iowa. Because of the unknown and unique characteristics of each site (such as
amount and type of residues present, physical characteristics of the site and
the environmental risk), and uncertain regulatory requirements, we are not able
to determine the maximum liability for the remediation of these sites. UE has
recorded a $16 million liability as of December 31, 2004, to represent its
estimated minimum obligation. At this time, we are unable to determine what
portion of these costs, if any, will be eligible for recovery from insurance
carriers.

In June
2000, the EPA notified UE and numerous other companies that former landfills and
lagoons in Sauget, Illinois, may contain soil and groundwater contamination.
These sites are known as Sauget Area 1 and Sauget Area 2. From approximately
1926 until 1976, UE operated a power generating facility adjacent to Sauget Area
2; UE currently owns and operates electric transmission and distribution
facilities in or near Sauget Areas 1 and 2.

In
September 2000, the DOJ was granted leave by the U.S. District Court of the
Southern District of Illinois to add numerous additional parties, including UE,
to a pre-existing lawsuit between the government and others. The government
seeks recovery of response costs under CERCLA (Superfund), incurred in
connection with the remediation of Sauget Area 1. In October 2003, the
government dismissed UE as a party to the lawsuit. UE considers the Sauget Area
1 litigation closed.

In
September 2001, the EPA proposed in the Federal Register that Sauget Area 1 and
Sauget Area 2 be listed on the National Priorities List. The inclusion of a site
on this list allows the EPA to access Superfund trust monies to fund site
remediations. With respect to Sauget Area 2 and under the terms of an
Administrative Order and Consent, UE has joined with other potentially
responsible parties to evaluate the extent of potential contamination. We are
unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Sauget Area 2 site on our results
of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

In
October 2002, UE was included in a Unilateral Administrative Order list of
potentially liable parties for groundwater contamination for a portion of the
Sauget Area 2 site. The Unilateral Administrative Order encompasses the
groundwater contamination releasing to the Mississippi River adjacent to
Monsanto Chemical Company’s (now known as Solutia) former chemical waste
landfill and the resulting impact area in the Mississippi River. UE is being
asked to participate in response activities that involve the installation of a
barrier wall around a chemical waste site with three recovery wells to divert
groundwater flow. The projected cost for this remedy method is $26 million. In
November 2002, UE sent a letter to the EPA asserting its defenses to the
Unilateral Administrative Order and requested its removal from the list of
potentially responsible parties under the Unilateral Administrative Order.
Solutia agreed to comply with the Unilateral Administrative Order. However, in
December 2003, Solutia filed for bankruptcy protection; it is now seeking to
discharge its environmental liabilities. In March 2004, Pharmacia Corporation,
the former parent company of Solutia, confirmed its intent to comply with the
EPA’s Unilateral Administrative Order. As the status of future remediation at
Sauget Area 2 or compliance with the Unilateral Administrative Order is
uncertain, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Sauget Area 2
site on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. In December
2004, the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Cooper Industries, Inc. vs. Availl
Services Inc. limited the circumstances under which potentially responsible
parties could assert cost-recovery claims against other potentially responsible
parties. As a result of this ruling, UE may not be able to recover from other
potentially responsible parties the costs it incurs in complying with EPA
orders.


In
October 2002, CILCO submitted a corrective action plan to the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency (Illinois EPA) in accordance with permit
conditions to address groundwater issues associated with the recycle pond and
ash ponds at the Duck Creek power plant facility. In January 2003, the Illinois
EPA accepted portions of the plan but rejected other portions. Additional
discussions with the Illinois EPA will be necessary to develop an acceptable
plan. CILCORP and CILCO both have a liability of $5 million at December 31,
2004, included on their Consolidated Balance Sheets for the estimated cost of
the remediation effort to treat and discharge the recycle system water in order
to address these groundwater issues. Future CILCO capital expenditures at Duck
Creek will include construction of a dry fly ash collection system, a landfill,
and a new pond. CILCO estimates that future capital expenditures for the
indicated activities could be approximately $15 million by 2008.

In
addition, our operations or those of our predecessor companies, involve the use,
disposal and, in appropriate circumstances, the cleanup of substances regulated
under environmental protection laws. We are unable to determine the impact these
actions may have on our results of operations, financial position, or
liquidity.

Waste
Disposal

On July
30, 2002, the Illinois Attorney General’s Office advised us that it would be
commencing an enforcement action concerning an inactive waste disposal site near
Coffeen, Illinois. This is the location of a disposal facility that is permitted
by the Illinois EPA to receive fly ash from Genco’s Coffeen power plant. The
Illinois Attorney General also notified the disposal facility’s current and
former owners about the proposed enforcement action. The Attorney General’s
Office advised us that it may initiate an action under CERCLA (Superfund) to
recover past costs incurred at the site ($0.3 million) and to obtain a
declaratory judgment as to liability for future costs. Neither Genco, the
current owner of the Coffeen power plant, nor CIPS, the prior owner of the
Coffeen power plant, owned or operated the disposal facility. We do not expect
that this matter will have a material adverse effect on Ameren’s, CIPS' or
Genco’s results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Emission
Credits

Both
federal and state laws require significant reductions in SO


and
NO

x

emissions from burning fossil fuels. The Clean Air Act and NO

x

Budget
Trading Program created marketable commodities called allowances. Each allowance
gives the owner the right to emit one ton of SO


or
NO

x

. All
existing generating facilities have been allocated allowances that are based on
past production and the statutory emission reduction goals. UE, Genco, CILCO and
EEI have recorded these allowances at no cost. If additional allowances are
needed for new generating facilities, they can be purchased from facilities
having excess allowances or from allowance banks. Our generating facilities
comply with the SO


limits
through the use and purchase of allowances, the use of low-sulfur fuels, or the
application of pollution control technology. The NO

x

Budget
Trading Program limits emissions of NO

x

during
the ozone season (May through September). The NO

x

Budget
Trading Program applies to all electric generating units in Illinois beginning
in 2004 and in the eastern third of Missouri, where UE’s coal-fired power plants
are located, beginning in 2007. Our generating facilities are expected to comply
with the NO

x

limits
through the use and purchase of allowances or through the application of
pollution control technology, including low NO

x

burners,
over-fire air systems, combustion optimization, and selective catalytic
reduction systems.

As of
December 31 2004, UE, Genco, CILCO, and EEI held 1.6 million, 0.4 million, 0.2
million, and 0.3 million tons, respectively, of SO


emission
allowances with vintages from 2004 to 2012. Each company possesses additional
allowances for use in periods beyond 2012. As of December 31, 2004, UE, Genco,
CILCO and EEI Illinois facilities held 290, 22,400, 6,300 and 8,600 tons,
respectively, of NO

X

emission
allowances with vintages from 2004 to 2007. The Illinois EPA is still
determining some NO

x

emission
allowance allocations for this period and 2008. UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI expect
to use a substantial portion of the SO


and
NO

x

allowances for ongoing operations. Allocations of NO

x

allowances for Missouri facilities are pending the finalization of rules by
Missouri regulators. New environmental regulations, including the Clean Air
Interstate Rule, the timing of the installation of pollution control equipment,
and level of operations will have a significant impact on the amount of
allowances actually required for ongoing operations.

Asbestos-Related
Litigation

Ameren,
UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been named, along with numerous other
parties, in a number of lawsuits that have been filed by certain plaintiffs
claiming varying degrees of injury from asbestos exposure. Most have been filed
in the Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois. The number of total defendants
named in each case is significant; as many as 235 parties are named in some
cases and as few as five in others. However, the average number of parties is 61
in the cases that were pending as of December 31, 2004.

The claims filed against Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP allege injury
from asbestos exposure during the plaintiffs’ activities at our present or
former electric generating plants. Former CIPS plants are now owned by Genco,
and most former CILCO plants are now owned by AERG. Most of IP’s plants were
transferred to a Dynegy subsidiary prior to Ameren’s acquisition of IP. As a
part of the transfer of ownership of the CIPS and CILCO generating plants, the
transferor (CIPS or CILCO) has contractually agreed to


indemnify the transferee (Genco or AERG) for liabilities
associated with asbestos-related claims arising from activities prior to the
transfer. Each lawsuit seeks unspecified damages in excess of $50,000, which, if
proved, typically would be shared among the named defendants.

From
September 30, 2004, through December 31, 2004, 24 additional asbestos-related
lawsuits were filed against UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP, mostly in the Circuit Court
of Madison County, Illinois; three lawsuits were dismissed and one was settled.
The following table presents the status as of December 31, 2004, of the
asbestos-related lawsuits that have been filed against the Ameren
Companies:

(a)

Addition
      of the numbers in the individual columns does not equal the total column
      because some of the lawsuits name multiple Ameren entities as defendants.

In January 2005, UE filed suit in the Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois,
alleging that four of its historic liability insurers have failed to pay more
than $2 million in fees and costs relating to the defense and investigation of
more than 120 asbestos lawsuits filed against UE. The defendant insurers are
American Automobile Insurance Co., Pacific Insurance Co., Royal Insurance Co. of
America and Royal Indemnity Co. These insurers insured UE from the late 1940s
through the early 1970s for liability arising out of the work of independent
contractors working at UE’s facilities. We are unable to predict the outcome of
this lawsuit.

As of December 31, 2004, five asbestos-related lawsuits were pending against
EEI. The general liability insurance maintained by EEI provides coverage with
respect to liabilities arising from asbestos-related claims.

The Ameren Companies believe that the final disposition of these proceedings
will not have a material adverse effect on their results of operations,
financial position, or liquidity. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters - IP
and EEI Acquisition for information on the ICC’s approval of a tariff rider
through which asbestos-related litigation claims will be allowed to be recovered
from IP’s electric customers, subject to certain terms, commencing in
2007.

Other
Matters

Enron
Litigation Settlement

In May 2001, CILCO and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI), a subsidiary of Enron
Corporation (Enron), entered into a master agreement for electric purchases and
sales, which covered energy transactions scheduled for deliveries during the
period of 2001 to 2003. In November 2001, EPMI demanded that CILCO post $28
million in collateral based on mark-to-market exposure of open transactions.
Also in November 2001, CILCO notified EPMI that events of default had occurred
under the master agreement. Therefore, pursuant to the termination provisions of
the master agreement it declared the master agreement terminated effective
December 20, 2001. Enron and EPMI filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions in
December 2001 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New
York. In December 2002, EPMI filed a complaint against AES, Constellation New
Energy, Inc., formerly known as AES New Energy Inc., and CILCO in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court seeking $31 million. As a result of court-ordered mediation of
this matter, a settlement agreement was reached among the parties and approved
by the Bankruptcy Court on September 30, 2004. This settlement agreement and
court order settled the outstanding claims by requiring CILCO to pay $20.9
million to an Enron subsidiary. This settlement payment was made during October
2004. The payment also settled an unrelated dispute between CILCO and another
Enron subsidiary, Enron North America Corporation (ENA), over ENA’s failure to
deliver natural gas to CILCO pursuant to transactions entered into in May and
October 2001. AES, in conjunction with its sale of CILCORP to Ameren in 2003,
agreed to indemnify Ameren against the after-tax cost of all liabilities, which
includes the settlement payment, legal fees, and expenses incurred by CILCO
relating to the Enron claim. Ameren assigned its indemnification rights to
CILCO. The indemnification payment from AES to CILCO also took place in October
2004. As a result of the income tax treatment afforded the settlement and
related indemnification, this settlement had no earnings impact on Ameren,
CILCORP or CILCO.

Retiree
Medical Plan Litigation

In June 2003, 20 retirees and surviving spouses of retirees of various Ameren
companies (the plaintiffs) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Illinois, against Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco and Ameren
Services, and against our Retiree Medical Plan and by an amended complaint, our
Group Medical Plan (the defendants). The retirees were members of various local
labor unions of the IBEW and the IUOE. The complaint, referred to as Barnett et
al. vs. Ameren Corporation, et al., alleged, among other things, that the
defendants recent actions relating to requiring retirees to pay a portion of
their own health care premiums or


increasing the premiums paid by dependents or surviving
spouses of retirees violate the ERISA and Labor Management Relations Act of 1947
and constitute a breach of the defendants’ fiduciary duties.

In July
2004, the District Court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to certify this lawsuit
as a class action and in September 2004, the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of
Appeals denied the plaintiffs’ application to appeal the District Court’s
decision. In January 2005, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion for
summary judgment, which dismisses the plaintiffs’ complaint against the
defendants with prejudice. In February 2005, the plaintiffs filed a notice of
appeal of the District Court’s ruling with the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of
Appeals. We do not believe the final resolution of this matter will have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or
liquidity.

IP
Litigation

Kemerer vs. IP was brought against IP in the Circuit Court of Mercer County,
Illinois, by the wife of a man who died in 2000 when he backed his aluminum
ladder into overhead power lines and was electrocuted. In the lawsuit, the
plaintiff sought to recover on allegations of wrongful death (including lost
wages and pain and suffering), negligent infliction of emotional distress (to
the decedent’s wife), and punitive damages. The case was tried before a jury in
January 2004, and the jury awarded the plaintiff $1.6 million in actual damages
and $3 million in punitive damages. In January 2005, IP entered into a
settlement agreement with the plaintiff resolving all outstanding matters; the
terms of the settlement are confidential. This settlement will not have a
material adverse effect upon IP’s results of operations, financial position, or
liquidity.

Another
case involved plaintiffs Lucash and Johnson, who were killed in an automobile
accident in February 2001 when their car struck an IP guy wire and utility pole
and caught fire. The plaintiffs’ families filed lawsuits against IP in the
Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois, which asserted wrongful death and
survivorship causes of action alleging that IP failed to properly maintain its
electrical equipment and did not have authority for the location of the pole.
The lawsuit sought unspecified damages in excess of $50,000. In February 2005,
IP entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs that resolved all
outstanding matters; the terms of those settlements are confidential. Those
settlements will not have a material adverse effect upon IP’s results of
operation, financial position, or liquidity.

Leveraged
Leases

Ameren owns interests in assets that have been financed as leveraged leases. One
of these leveraged leases is a $10 million investment at December 31, 2004, in
an aircraft leased to Delta Air Lines. Delta Air Lines reported significant
operating losses and disclosed in its Form 10-Q filing for the three months
ended September 30, 2004, that these results are unsustainable and underscore
the urgent need to reduce its cost structure. Ameren could lose all or a portion
of its investment in the Delta Air Lines lease in the event of a bankruptcy or
default by Delta Air Lines or any voluntary restructuring of the lease. As of
December 31, 2004, Delta Air Lines was current on its payments on this
lease.

Regulation

Regulatory changes enacted and being considered at the federal and state levels
continue to change the structure of the utility industry and utility regulation,
as well as to encourage increased competition. At this time, we are unable to
predict the impact of these changes on our future results of operations,
financial position, or liquidity. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for
further information.

NOTE
16 - CALLAWAY NUCLEAR PLANT

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is responsible for the
permanent storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE currently charges
one mill, or


/


of one
cent, per nuclear-generated kilowatthour sold for future disposal of spent fuel.
Pursuant to this act, UE collects one mill from its electric customers for each
kilowatthour of electricity that it generates from its Callaway nuclear plant.
Electric utility rates charged to customers provide for recovery of such costs.
The DOE is not expected to have its permanent storage facility for spent fuel
available until at least 2010. UE has sufficient storage capacity at its
Callaway nuclear plant until 2020. It has the capability for additional storage
capacity through the licensed life of the plant. The delayed availability of the
DOE’s disposal facility is not expected to adversely affect the continued
operation of the Callaway nuclear plant through its currently licensed
life.

Electric
utility rates charged to customers provide for the recovery of the Callaway
nuclear plant’s decommissioning costs, which include decontamination,
dismantling, and site restoration costs, over an assumed 40-year life of the
plant, ending with the expiration of the plant’s operating license in 2024. The
Callaway nuclear plant site is assumed to be decommissioned based on immediate
dismantlement method and removal from service. Ameren and UE have recorded an
asset retirement obligation for the Callaway nuclear plant decommissioning costs
at fair value, which represents the present value of estimated future cash
outflows. See the discussion of SFAS No.143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations” in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Decommissioning costs are charged to cost of services used to establish electric
rates for UE’s customers. These costs amounted to $7 million in each of the
years 2004, 2003 and 2002. Every three years, the MoPSC and ICC


require
UE to file updated cost studies for decommissioning its Callaway nuclear plant.
Electric rates may be adjusted at such times to reflect changed estimates.

The
latest studies were filed in 2002; updated cost studies are expected to be filed
in September 2005.

Costs
collected from customers are deposited in an external trust fund to provide for
the Callaway nuclear plant’s decommissioning. If the assumed return on trust
assets is not earned, we believe that it is probable that any such earnings
deficiency will be recovered in rates. The fair value of the nuclear
decommissioning trust fund for UE’s Callaway nuclear plant is reported in
Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund in Ameren’s and UE’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. This amount is legally restricted. It may be used only to fund the costs
of nuclear decommissioning. Changes in the fair value of the trust fund are
recorded as an increase or decrease to the nuclear decommissioning trust fund
and to the regulatory asset recorded in connection with the adoption of SFAS No.
143. Upon the completion of UE’s transfer of its Illinois electric and gas
utility businesses to CIPS, which is subject to the receipt of regulatory
approvals, the assets and liabilities related to the Illinois portion of the
decommissioning trust fund will be transferred to Missouri. See Note 3 - Rate
and Regulatory Matters for further information.

NOTE
17 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash,
Temporary Investments and Short-term Borrowings

The
carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of
these instruments.

Marketable
Securities

The fair value is based on quoted market prices obtained from dealers or
investment managers.

Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Fund

The fair-value estimate is based on quoted market prices for
securities.

Preferred
Stock of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP

The fair-value estimate is based on the quoted market prices for the same or
similar issues.

Long-term
Debt

The fair-value estimate is based on the quoted market prices for same or similar
issues or on the current rates offered to the Ameren Companies for debt of
comparable maturities.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

Market prices used to determine fair value are primarily based on published
indices and closing exchange prices. In addition, valuations must also rely on
management’s estimates, which take into account time value of money and
volatility factors.

The
following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our
financial instruments at December 31, 2004 and 2003:

(a)

Excludes
      amounts for IP for 2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and
      non-Registrant subsidiaries and intercompany
  eliminations.

(b)

CILCORP
      consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its
      balances.

(c)

      amounts represent predecessor information.


UE has investments in debt and equity securities that are held in trust funds
for the purpose of funding the nuclear decommissioning of its Callaway nuclear
plant. See Note 16 - Callaway Nuclear Plant for further information. We have
classified these investments in debt and equity securities as available for sale
and have recorded all such investments at their fair market value at December
31, 2004 and 2003. Investments by the nuclear decommissioning trust fund are
allocated 60% to 70% to equity securities, with the balance invested in
fixed-income securities. Fixed-income investments are limited to U.S. government
or agency securities, municipal bonds, or investment-grade corporate securities.
The proceeds from the sale of investments were $131 million in 2004 (2003 - $123
million; 2002 - $141 million). Using the specific identification method to
determine cost, the gross realized gains on those sales were $1 million for 2004
(2003 - $1 million; 2002 - less than $1 million). Net realized and unrealized
gains and losses are reflected in regulatory assets on Ameren’s and UE’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets. This reporting is consistent with the method we use
to account for the decommissioning costs recovered in rates. Gains or losses on
assets in the trust fund could result in lower or higher funding requirements
for decommissioning costs, which we believe would be reflected in electric rates
paid by UE’s customers.

The
following table presents the costs and fair values of investments in debt and
equity securities in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund at December 31,
2004, and 2003:

ITEM
9.   CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

None.



ITEM
9A.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Only
Ameren as an “accelerated filer”, with respect to the reporting requirements of
the Exchange Act was required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations as to management’s assessment of
internal control over financial reporting for the 2004 fiscal year. UE, CIPS,
Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP are not accelerated filers and were not required to
comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC
regulations as to management’s assessment of internal control over financial
reporting for the 2004 fiscal year.

(a)

Evaluation
      of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of
December 31, 2004, the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of each of the Ameren Companies have evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of such Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon
that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
of each of the Ameren Companies have concluded that such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting them to any material information
relating to such Registrant that is required in such Registrant’s reports filed
or submitted to the SEC under the Exchange Act.

(b)

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a - 15(f) and 15d - 15(f). Under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, an evaluation was conducted of the effectiveness of
Ameren’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Based on that evaluation under the framework in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by
the COSO

,

management
concluded that Ameren’s internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2004. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
Ameren’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report herein under Part II, Item
8.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has excluded IP from its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, because it was acquired by Ameren
in a purchase business combination on September 30, 2004. PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, Ameren’s independent registered public accounting firm, also excluded IP
from its audit of internal control over financial reporting. IP is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Ameren whose total assets and total revenues represented 18%
and 7%, respectively, of Ameren’s consolidated financial statement amounts as
of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2004.

(c)

Change
      in Internal Controls

There has
been no change in the Ameren Companies’ internal control over financial
reporting during their most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, their internal control over
financial reporting, except for the modification of certain of the internal
controls of IP to make them consistent with the internal controls of the other
Ameren Companies, and the application of Ameren’s existing controls to include
the operations of IP.

ITEM
9B.   OTHER INFORMATION.

The
Ameren Companies have no information reportable under this item that is required
to be disclosed in a report on SEC Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of 2004,
which has not previously been reported on an SEC Form
8-K.


PART
III

ITEM
10.   DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANTS.

Information
required by Items 401 and 405 of SEC Regulation S-K for Ameren will be included
in its definitive proxy statement for its 2005 annual meeting of shareholders
filed pursuant to SEC Regulation 14A and is incorporated herein by reference.
Information required by these SEC Regulation S-K items for UE, CIPS and CILCO
will be included in each company’s definitive information statement for its 2005
annual meetings of shareholders filed pursuant to Regulation 14C and is
incorporated herein by reference. With respect to Genco and CILCORP, this
information is omitted in reliance on General Instruction I(2) of Form 10-K.
Information required by SEC Regulation S-K Items 401 and 405 for IP is set forth
at the conclusion of this Item 10.

Information
concerning executive officers of the Ameren Companies required by Item 401 of
SEC Regulation S-K is reported under a separate caption entitled “Executive
Officers of the Registrants” in Part I of this report.

As
“controlled companies” of their ultimate parent, Ameren, as defined by the NYSE
listing standards, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP do not have separately
designated standing audit committees of their own, but instead use Ameren’s
Audit Committee to perform such committee functions for their boards of
directors as permitted under exemptions provided in the NYSE listing standards.
Harvey Saligman serves as chairman of Ameren’s Audit Committee and Richard A.
Liddy, Richard A. Lumpkin, Paul L. Miller Jr., and Douglas R. Oberhelman serve
as members. The board of directors of Ameren has determined that it has one
Audit Committee financial expert serving on its Audit Committee. He is Douglas
R. Oberhelman, and he has been determined by Ameren’s board of directors to be
“independent” as that term is used in SEC Regulation 14A.

Also in
accordance with exemptions provided under the NYSE listing standards, the boards
of directors of UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP use the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee of Ameren’s board to perform such committee
functions. This committee is responsible for the nomination of directors and
corporate governance practices. Ameren’s Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee will consider director nominations from shareholders in accordance
with its Policy Regarding Nominations of Directors, which can be found on
Ameren’s Internet Web site (

http://www.ameren.com

). This
policy became applicable to IP upon its acquisition by Ameren on September 30,
2004.

To
provide for ethical conduct in its financial management and reporting, Ameren
has adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to the principal executive officer,
the principal financial officer, the principal accounting officer and
controller, and the treasurer of the Ameren Companies. Ameren has also adopted a
Code of Business Conduct that applies to the directors, officers and employees
of the Ameren Companies, referred to as the Corporate Compliance Policy. The
Ameren Companies make available free of charge through Ameren’s Internet site
(

http://www.ameren.com)

the Code
of Ethics and Corporate Compliance Policy. These documents are also available
without charge in print upon written request to Ameren Corporation, Attention:
Secretary, P.O. Box 66149, St. Louis, Missouri 63166-6149. Any amendment
to, or waiver of, the Code of Ethics and Corporate Compliance Policy will be
posted on Ameren’s Internet site within five business dates following the date
of the amendment or waiver.

Information
Concerning IP’s Directors as Required by Item 401 of SEC Regulation
S-K

The current members of IP’s board of directors are Warner L. Baxter, Scott A.
Cisel, Daniel F. Cole, Gary L. Rainwater, Steven R. Sullivan, Thomas R. Voss,
and David A. Whiteley, each of whom is an executive officer of IP or an
affiliate. For each director’s age as of December 31, 2004, and business
background for at least the last five years, refer to “Executive Officers of the
Registrants” in Part I of this report. All of the directors were initially
elected by directors upon Ameren’s acquisition of IP in September 2004,
except for Cisel, who was elected by the directors to fill a vacancy on the
board in October 2004. All of these directors have been nominated by Ameren’s
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for re-election to IP’s Board at
its annual meeting of shareholders to be held on April 26, 2005, to serve until
the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their respective successors
have been duly elected and qualified. Each nominee has consented to being
nominated for director and has agreed to serve if elected. No arrangement or
understanding exists between any nominee and IP or, to IP’s knowledge, any other
person or persons pursuant to which any nominee was or is to be selected as a
director or nominee. There are no family relationships among any directors,
executive officers, or people nominated or chosen by IP to become directors or
executive officers. See Item 13 under Part III of this report for certain
reportable family relationships with nonexecutive officers. IP has been informed
that Ameren intends to cast the votes of all of the outstanding shares of common
stock of IP for the election of the nominees for directors named above.
Accordingly, all the nominees are expected to be re-elected.


Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance (for IP as Required by Item 405
of SEC Regulation S-K)

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, as amended, requires IP’s directors and
executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of IP’s common stock to
file with the SEC and the NYSE reports of their ownership in IP’s preferred
stock, and, in some cases, of its ultimate parent’s common stock, and of changes
in that ownership. SEC regulations also require IP to identify in this report
any person subject to this requirement who failed to file any such report on a
timely basis. Based solely on a review of the filed reports and written
representations that no other reports are required, each of IP’s directors and
executive officers complied with all such filing requirements during
2004.

ITEM
11.   EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

Information
required by Item 402 of SEC Regulation S-K for Ameren will be included in its
definitive proxy statement for its 2005 annual meeting of shareholders filed
pursuant to SEC Regulation 14A and is incor-porated herein by reference.
Information required by this SEC Regulation S-K item for UE, CIPS and CILCO will
be included in each company’s definitive information statement for their 2005
annual meetings of shareholders filed pursuant to Regulation 14C and is
incorporated herein by reference. With respect to Genco and CILCORP, this
information is omitted in reliance on General Instruction I(2) of Form 10-K.
Information required by SEC Regulation S-K Item 402 for IP is as
follows.

Compensation

The following tables set forth compensation information for the periods
indicated for IP’s chairman and chief executive officer and the four other most

Amounts
for each fiscal year represent bonus compensation earned for that year payable

(c)

Restricted
stock awards relate to Ameren common stock. This column is based on the closing
market price of Ameren common stock on the date the restricted stock was
awarded

(for 2004, $46.34 per share on February 13, 2004

;

for 2003,
$39.74 per share on February 14, 2003; and for 2002, $42.50 per share on
February 8, 2002). The aggregate number

of

restricted
shares of Ameren common stock held at December 31, 2004 and the value of such
holdings, based on the number of restricted shares for which restrictions
have

not
l

apsed
times the closing market price at December 31, 2004 ($50.14

per
share), was 41,329 shares and $2,072,236 for Rainwater; 20,118

shares

and
$1,008,717

for
Baxter;

13,245

shares

and
$664,104 for Voss; 13,343

shares
and $669,018

for Cole;
and 12,332

shares
and $618,326

for
Sullivan. Restricted shares have the potential to vest equally over

a

seven-year

period
from date of grant (one-seventh on each anniversary date) based upon the
achievement of certain Ameren performance levels and upon the achievement of

required
stock

ownership
levels based on position and salary (ownership levels range from three to five
times salary). The vesting period is reduced from seven years to
three

years

if
Ameren’s

ongoing
earnings per share achieve a prescribed growth rate over the three-year period.
Restricted stock that would otherwise vest remain restricted until

prescribed
minimum

stock
ownership levels are satisfied by the IP Named Executive Officer. Upon the
occurrence of a “change in control” as defined in Ameren's Long-Term

Incentive

Plan
of 1998, all

restrictions
and vesting requirements with respect to the restricted stock terminate.
Dividends paid on restricted shares are reinvested in additional

shares of

Ameren
common

stock,
which vest concurrently with the restricted shares. The IP Named Executive
Officers are entitled to voting privileges associated with the

restricted

shares to
the extent the

restricted
shares have not been forfeited.

(d)

Options
relate to Ameren common stock, except with respect to Altenbaumer, whose options
were granted under a Dynegy plan in Dynegy common stock.

(e)

For
the IP Named Executive Officers, amounts include matching contributions to
Ameren’s 401(k) plan, the dollar value of insurance premiums paid by Ameren with
respect to term

life
insurance, and above-market earnings on deferred compensation. See "Arrangements
with IP Named Executive Officers - Deferred Compensation Plans" below. For
fiscal year

2004,
earnings on deferred compensation were not above market as defined by SEC rules.
For fiscal year 2004, the amount includes (1) matching contributions to
Ameren’s 401(k)

plan and
(2) the dollar value of insurance premiums paid by Ameren with respect to term
life insurance as follows:

(1)

Altenbaumer
served as president of IP until his retirement effective April 1, 2004. All
compensation presented for Altenbaumer in this table relates to compensation
paid prior to

of his 2004 “All Other Compensation” were paid pursuant to his severance
agreement

and
release entered into with Dynegy and IP in January 2004 in connection with his
resignation from IP and Dynegy, which is described under “Employment Contracts
and

Change-In-Control
Arrangements” in Part III, Item 11. Executive Compensation, of IP’s 2003 Annual
Report on Form 10-K. The balance of Altenbaumer’s 2004 “All Other

Compensation”
consisted of $40,385 as payment for banked vacation earned in 2000 and $4,213 in
matching contributions to IP’s 401(k) plan.

Young is
an executive officer of Dynegy who succeeded Altenbaumer as president of IP from
April 1, 2004, until the completion of Ameren’s acquisition of IP on
September 30,

2004.
Young was not compensated by IP for serving as its president. He was compensated
by Dynegy for services rendered in all capacities to Dynegy and its affiliates,
including

IP.
Information with respect to Young’s compensation for 2004 is expected to be
reported in Dynegy’s definitive proxy statement for its 2005 annual meeting of
shareholders,

and his
compensation for 2003 and 2002 was reported in Dynegy’s definitive proxy
statement for its 2004 annual meeting of shareholders, neither of which shall be
deemed to be

incorporated
by reference into this report and for which the Ameren Companies accept no
responsibility.

These
columns represent the excess of the closing price of Ameren’s common stock of
$50.14 per share, as of December 31, 2004, above the exercise price of the
options. The

amounts
under the Exercisable column report the “value” of options that are vested and
therefore could be exercised. The Unexercisable column reports the “value” of
options

guarantee that, if and when these options are exercised, they will have this
value.

Upon

exercisable.

Ameren
Retirement Plan (as it applies to the IP Named Executive
Officers)

Most
salaried employees of Ameren and its subsidiaries, including the IP Named
Executive Officers, earn benefits under the Ameren Retirement Plan immediately
upon employment. Benefits generally become vested after five years of service.
On an annual basis a bookkeeping account in a participant’s name is credited
with an amount equal to a percentage of the participant’s pensionable earnings
for the year. Pensionable earnings include base pay, overtime and annual
bonuses, which are equivalent to amounts shown as “Annual Compensation” in the
Summary Compensation Table above. The applicable percentage is based on the
participant’s age as of December 31 of that year. If the participant was an
employee prior to July 1, 1998, an additional transition credit percentage is
credited to the participant’s account through 2007 (or an earlier date if the
participant had less than 10 years of service on December 31,
1998).

An
      additional regular credit of 3% is received for pensionable earnings above
      the Social Security wage base.

These accounts also receive interest credits based on the average yield for
one-year U.S. Treasury Bills for the previous October, plus 1%. The minimum
interest credit is 5%. In addition, certain annuity benefits earned by
participants under prior plans as of December 31, 1997, were converted to
additional credit balances under the Ameren Retirement Plan as of January 1,
1998. Effective January 1, 2001, an Enhancement Account was added that provides
a $500 additional credit at the end of each year. When a participant terminates
employment, the amount credited to the participant’s account is converted to an
annuity or paid to the participant in a lump sum. The participant can also
choose to defer distribution, in which case the account balance is credited with
interest at the applicable rate until the future date of distribution. Benefits
are not subject to any deduction for Social Security or other offset
amounts.

In certain cases, pension benefits under the Retirement Plan are reduced to
comply with maximum limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. A
Supplemental Retirement Plan is maintained by Ameren to provide for a
supplemental benefit equal to the difference between the benefit that would have
been paid if such Code limitations were not in effect and the reduced benefit
payable as a result of such Code limitations. The plan is unfunded and is not a

Compensation
of IP Directors

Directors who are employees or directors of Ameren or any of its subsidiaries
receive no additional compensation for their services as IP directors. All
directors of IP are executive officers of Ameren or its subsidiaries.

Arrangements
with IP Named Executive Officers

Change
of Control Severance Plan

Under the Ameren Corporation Change of Control Severance Plan, designated
officers of Ameren and its subsidiaries, including the IP Named Executive
Officers, are entitled to receive severance benefits if their employment is
terminated under certain circumstances within three years after a “change of
control.” A “change of control” occurs, in general, if (1) any individual,
entity or group acquires 20% or more of the outstanding Common Stock of Ameren
or of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of Ameren;
(2) individuals who, as of the effective date of the plan, constitute the board
of directors of Ameren, or who have been approved by a majority of the board,
cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the board; (3) Ameren enters
into certain business combinations, unless certain requirements are met
regarding continuing ownership of the outstanding common stock and voting
securities of Ameren and the membership of its board of directors; or (4)
approval by Ameren shareholders of a complete liquidation or dissolution of
Ameren.

Severance benefits are based upon a severance period of two or three years,
depending on the officer’s position. An officer entitled to severance will
receive a cash lump sum equal to the following: (1) salary and unpaid
vacation pay through the date of termination; (2) a pro rata bonus for the year
of termination, and base salary and bonus for the severance period; (3)
continued employee welfare benefits for the severance period; (4) a cash payment
equal to the actuarial value of the additional benefits the officer would have
received under Ameren’s qualified and supplemental retirement plans if employed
for the severance period; (5) up to $30,000 for the cost of outplacement
services; and (6) reimbursement for any excise tax imposed on such benefits as
excess payments under the Internal Revenue Code.

Deferred
Compensation Plans

Under the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan and its Executive Incentive
Compensation Program Elective Deferral Provisions, executive officers and
certain key employees, including the IP

Named
Executive Officers, may choose to defer up to 30% of their salary and 25%, 50%,
75%, or 100% of their bonus. All of the IP Named Executive Officers have
deferred amounts under one or both of the plans. The minimum amount of salary
that can be deferred in any calendar year is $3,500 and the minimum amount of
bonus that can be annually deferred is $2,000. Deferred amounts under both
plans earn interest at 150% of the average Mergent's Seasoned AAA Corporate Bond
Yield Index (“Mergent’s Index,” formerly called Moody’s Index) until the
participant retires or attains 65 years of age. After the participant retires,
attains 65 years of age, or dies, the deferred amounts under the plans earn the
average Mergent's Index rate. For 2004, the average Mergent’s Index rate was
5.67%, 150% of that was 8.51%. A participant may choose to receive the deferred
amounts at retirement in a lump sum payment or in installments over a set
period, up to 15 years with respect to deferred salary and 10 years with respect
to deferred bonus. If a participant revokes the deferral election under either
plan, deferred amounts will be distributed in a lump sum with all interest
credited to the deferral account forfeited. In the event a participant
terminates employment with Ameren prior to attaining retirement age and after
the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in such plans), the balance in
such participant’s deferral account, including interest payable at 150% of the
average Mergent’s Index is distributable in a lump sum to the participant within
30 days of the date the participant terminates employment.


Severance
Agreement and Consulting Agreement with Former IP President

In January 2004, prior to Ameren’s acquisition of IP, Dynegy and IP entered into
a severance agreement and release and a consulting agreement with Larry F.
Altenbaumer, then president of IP. These agreements are described under
“Employment Contracts and Change-In-Control Arrangements” in Part III, Item 11,
Executive Compensation, of IP’s 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

The members of the Human Resources Committee of the Ameren board of
directors performed compensation-related committee functions for IP for the
fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year after Ameren’s acquisition of IP. Its
members during this period were Gordon R. Lohman, Thomas A. Hays, Richard A.
Liddy, and John Peters MacCarthy. No member of this committee was at any time
during this part of the 2004 fiscal year or at any other time an officer or
employee of Ameren or IP, and no member had any relationship with Ameren or IP
requiring disclosure under applicable SEC rules. No executive officer of Ameren
or IP has served on the board of directors or compensation committee of any
other entity that has or has had one or more executive officers who served as a
member of Ameren’s or IP’s board of directors or Ameren’s Human Resources
Committee during the 2004 fiscal year. Prior to Ameren’s acquisition of IP, the
members of Dynegy’s compensation committee performed committee functions for IP.
There are no matters relating to interlocks or insider participation during this
period that IP is required to report.

included in its definitive proxy statement for its 2005 annual meeting of
shareholders filed pursuant to SEC Regulation 14A and is incor-porated herein by
reference. Information required by this SEC Regulation S-K item for UE, CIPS and

its 2005 annual meetings of shareholders filed pursuant to Regulation 14C and is
incorporated herein by reference. With respect to Genco and CILCORP, this
information is omitted in reliance on General Instruction I(2) of Form 10-K.
Information required by SEC Regulation S-K Item 403 for IP is as
follows.


Securities
of IP

All 23 million outstanding shares of IP’s common stock and 662,924 shares, or
approximately 73%, of IP’s preferred stock were acquired by Ameren from Dynegy
and its subsidiaries on September 30, 2004, and are owned by Ameren as of the
date of this report. This acquisition resulted in a change in control of IP. IP
is now a subsidiary of Ameren.

None of IP’s outstanding shares of preferred stock were owned by directors,
nominees for director, or executive officers of IP as of February 1, 2005. To
our knowledge, other than Ameren, which as noted above owns 73% of IP’s
outstanding preferred stock, there are no beneficial owners of 5% or more of
IP’s outstanding shares of preferred stock as of February 1, 2005, but no
independent inquiry has been made to determine whether any shareholder is the
beneficial owner of shares not registered in the name of such shareholder or
whether any shareholder is a member of a shareholder group.

Securities
of Ameren (As Applicable to IP)

The following table sets forth certain information known to IP with respect to
beneficial ownership of Ameren common stock as of February 1, 2005, for (1) each
director and nominee for director of IP, (2) the IP Named Executive Officers,
and (3) all executive officers, directors, and nominees for director as a group.
The table below does not include information regarding Larry F. Altenbaumer and
R. Blake Young, who each served as IP’s president at different times during 2004
prior to Ameren’s acquisition of IP.
