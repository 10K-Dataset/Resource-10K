FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS

Statements in this report not based on historical facts are
    considered “forward-looking” and, accordingly, involve
    risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
    differ materially from those discussed. Although such
    forward-looking statements have been made in good faith and are
    based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that the
    expected results will be achieved. These statements include
    (without limitation) statements as to future expectations,
    beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions, and
    financial performance. In connection with the “safe
    harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995, we are providing this cautionary statement
    to identify important factors that could cause actual results to
    differ materially from those anticipated. The following factors,
    in addition to those discussed under Risk Factors and elsewhere
    in this report and in our other filings with the SEC, could
    cause actual results to differ materially from management
    expectations suggested in such forward-looking statements:

•

regulatory or legislative actions, including changes in
    regulatory policies and ratemaking determinations, such as in
    UE’s pending electric and gas rate cases and the outcome of
    CIPS, CILCO and IP rate rehearing proceedings, or the enactment
    of legislation freezing electric rates at 2006 levels or similar
    actions that impair the full and timely recovery of costs in
    Illinois;

•

the implementation of the Ameren Illinois Utilities Customer
    Elect electric rate increase phase-in plan;

•

the impact of the termination of the JDA;

•

changes in laws and other governmental actions, including
    monetary and fiscal policies;

•

the effects of increased competition in the future due to, among
    other things, deregulation of certain aspects of our business at
    both the state and federal levels, and the implementation of
    deregulation, such as occurred when the electric rate freeze and
    power supply contracts expired in Illinois at the end of 2006;

•

the effects of participation in the MISO;

•

the availability of fuel such as coal, natural gas, and enriched
    uranium used to produce electricity; the availability of
    purchased power and natural gas for distribution; and the level
    and volatility of future market prices for such commodities,
    including the ability to recover the costs for such commodities;

•

the effectiveness of our risk management strategies and the use
    of financial and derivative instruments;

•

prices for power in the Midwest;

•

business and economic conditions, including their impact on
    interest rates;

•

disruptions of the capital markets or other events that make the
    Ameren Companies’ access to necessary capital more
    difficult or costly;

•

the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards and the
    application of appropriate technical accounting rules and
    guidance;

•

actions of credit rating agencies and the effects of such
    actions;

•

weather conditions and other natural phenomena;

•

the impact of system outages caused by severe weather conditions
    or other events;

•

generation plant construction, installation and performance,
    including costs associated with UE’s Taum Sauk
    pumped-storage hydroelectric plant incident and the plant’s
    future operation;

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

GENERAL

Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public
    utility holding company under PUHCA 2005 administered by FERC.
    Ameren was registered with the SEC as a public utility holding
    company under PUHCA 1935 until that act was repealed effective
    February 8, 2006. Ameren was formed in 1997 by the merger
    of UE and CIPSCO, the former parent company of CIPS. Ameren
    acquired CILCORP in 2003 and IP in 2004. Ameren’s primary
    assets are the common stock of its subsidiaries, including UE,
    CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP. Ameren’s subsidiaries, which
    are separate, independent legal entities, operate rate-regulated
    electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses,
    rate-regulated natural gas transmission and distribution
    businesses, and non-rate-regulated electric generation
    businesses in Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Ameren’s
    common stock depend upon distributions made to it by its
    subsidiaries.

The following table presents our total employees at
    December 31, 2006:

(a)

Total for Ameren includes Ameren registrant and nonregistrant
    subsidiaries.

The IBEW, the IUOE, the NCF&O and the Laborers and Gas
    Fitters labor unions collectively represent about 63% of
    Ameren’s total employees. They represent 73% of the
    employees at UE, 83% at CIPS, 71% at Genco, 71% at CILCORP, 71%
    at CILCO, and 91% at IP. Two IBEW collective bargaining
    agreements covering about 320 UE workers expired on
    September 30, 2006. Another IBEW agreement covering 17 IP
    workers expired on November 30, 2006. The UE collective
    bargaining agreements have been extended indefinitely by mutual
    agreement, and the IP agreement is currently in force under an
    extension, while negotiations continue on all three agreements.
    At this time, all employees continue to work without disruption.
    The most significant remaining issue associated with the UE
    agreements involves health care benefit plan revisions, and the
    most significant issue associated with the IP agreement involves
    continuity of work and incentive pay provisions. Most of the
    remaining collective bargaining agreements, covering 5,000
    employees at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP, expire
    throughout 2007.

For additional information about the development of our
    businesses, our business operations, and factors affecting our
    operations and financial position, see Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report and
    Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

Before the third quarter of 2006, Ameren reported only one
    business segment, Utility Operations, which comprised electric
    generation and electric and gas transmission and distribution
    operations. Ameren holding company activity was listed in the
    caption called Other.

In the third quarter of 2006, Ameren determined that it has
    three reportable segments: Missouri Regulated, Illinois
    Regulated and Non-rate-regulated Generation. UE determined it
    has one reportable segment: Missouri Regulated. CILCORP and
    CILCO determined they have two reportable segments: Illinois
    Regulated and Non-rate-regulated Generation. See
    Note 17 – Segment Information to our financial
    statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for
    additional information on reporting segments.

RATES AND
    REGULATION

Rates

Rates that UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are allowed to charge for
    their utility services are the single most important influence
    upon their and Ameren’s consolidated results of operations,
    financial position, and liquidity. The utility rates charged to
    UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP customers are determined by governmental
    entities. Decisions by these entities are influenced by many
    factors, including the cost of providing service, the quality of
    service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, economic
    conditions, public policy, and social and political views.
    Decisions made by these governmental entities regarding rates
    could have a material impact on the results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity of UE, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP
    and Ameren.

The ICC regulates rates and other matters for CIPS, CILCO and
    IP. The MoPSC regulates UE.

FERC also regulates UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP as to their
    ability to charge market-based rates for the sale and
    transmission of energy in interstate commerce and various other
    matters discussed below under General Regulatory Matters. Less
    than 5% of the Ameren Companies’ electric operating
    revenues fall under FERC regulations.

About 39% of Ameren’s electric and 12% of its gas operating
    revenues were subject to regulation by the MoPSC in the year
    ended December 31, 2006. About 43% of



Ameren’s electric and 88% of its gas operating revenues
    were subject to regulation by the ICC that year. Interchange
    revenues are not subject to direct MoPSC or ICC regulation.

Missouri
    Regulated

About 82% of UE’s electric and 100% of its gas operating
    revenues were subject to regulation by the MoPSC in the year
    ended December 31, 2006.

If certain criteria are met, UE’s gas rates may be adjusted
    without a traditional rate proceeding. PGA clauses permit
    prudently incurred natural gas costs to be passed directly to
    the consumer.

A new Missouri law enacted in July 2005 enables the MoPSC to put
    in place fuel and purchased power and environmental cost
    recovery mechanisms for Missouri’s utilities. The law also
    includes rate case filing requirements, a 2.5% annual rate
    increase cap for the environmental cost recovery mechanism, and
    prudency reviews, among other things. Rules for the fuel and
    purchased power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the
    MoPSC in September 2006 and became effective during the fourth
    quarter of 2006. We are unable to predict when rules
    implementing the environmental cost recovery mechanism will be
    formally proposed and adopted. UE requested approval of a fuel
    and purchased power cost recovery mechanism in its electric rate
    case filed with the MoPSC in July 2006. The MoPSC staff and
    intervenors have recommended that UE not be granted the right to
    use such a mechanism. UE also requested an environmental cost
    recovery mechanism as part of this electric rate case. However,
    no environmental adjustment clause has been submitted in the
    rate case since final environmental cost recovery rules have not
    been adopted. UE’s requests are subject to approval by the
    MoPSC.

For further information on Missouri rate matters, including the
    Missouri law enabling fuel, purchased power and environmental
    cost recovery mechanisms, UE’s pending electric and gas
    rate cases following the expiration of a rate-adjustment
    moratorium in 2006 and termination of the JDA among UE, CIPS and

    Regulatory Matters, and Note 14 – Commitments and
    Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report.

Illinois
    Regulated

The following table presents the approximate percentage of
    electric and gas operating revenues subject to regulation by the
    ICC for each of the Illinois Regulated companies for the
    year ended December 31, 2006:

Interchange revenues are not subject to ICC regulation.

During 2006, retail electric rates were subject to a legislative
    rate freeze in Illinois. In February 2005, CIPS, CILCO and IP
    filed with the ICC a proposal for power procurement through an

ICC-monitored

auction including, among other things, a rate mechanism that
    would pass power supply costs directly through to customers
    after the rate freeze expired on January 1, 2007, and power
    supply contracts expired December 2006. In January 2006, the ICC
    issued an order that unanimously approved the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ proposed power procurement auction and the
    related tariffs for the period commencing January 2, 2007,
    including the retail rates by which power supply costs would be
    passed through to electric customers.

The power procurement auction was held and declared successful
    for fixed-price customers in September 2006. The vast majority
    of electric customers of CIPS, CILCO and IP are fixed-price
    customers.

If certain criteria are met, CIPS’, CILCO’s and
    IP’s gas rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate
    proceeding. PGA clauses permit prudently incurred natural gas
    costs to be passed directly to the consumer.

Environmental adjustment rate riders authorized by the ICC
    permit the recovery of prudently incurred MGP remediation and
    litigation costs from CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s
    Illinois electric and natural gas utility customers. As a part
    of the order approving Ameren’s acquisition of IP, the ICC
    also approved a tariff rider that would allow IP to recover the
    costs of asbestos-related litigation claims, subject to the
    following terms. Beginning in 2007, 90% of cash expenditures in
    excess of the amount included in base electric rates will be
    recovered by IP from a $20 million trust fund established
    by IP and financed with contributions of $10 million each
    by Ameren and Dynegy. If cash expenditures are less than the
    amount in base rates, IP will contribute 90% of the difference
    to the fund. Once the trust fund is depleted, 90% of allowed
    cash expenditures in excess of base rates will be recovered
    through charges assessed to customers under the tariff rider.

This report includes further information on rate matters,
    including the ICC order allowing for the recovery of prudently
    incurred power costs effective January 2, 2007, and related
    court proceedings; CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s 2006
    ICC electric delivery services rate case orders; and actions
    taken by certain Illinois legislators, the Illinois governor,
    the Illinois attorney general, and others regarding the
    expiration of the rate freeze and oppositions to the power
    procurement auction. See Results of Operations and Outlook in
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial



Condition and Results of Operations under Part II,
    Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
    Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and
    Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, and
    Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report.

General
    Regulatory Matters

PUHCA 2005, enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005,
    repealed PUHCA 1935, effective February 8, 2006. Under
    PUHCA 2005, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP must receive FERC approval to
    issue short-term debt securities and to conduct certain
    acquisitions, mergers and consolidations involving electric
    utility holding companies having a value in excess of
    $10 million. In addition, these Ameren utilities must
    receive authorization from the applicable state public utility
    regulatory agency to issue stock and long-term debt securities
    with maturities of more than 12 months and to conduct
    mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other activities.
    Genco and EEI are subject to FERC’s jurisdiction when they
    issue any securities.

Under PUHCA 2005, FERC and any state public utility regulatory
    agencies may access books and records of Ameren and its
    subsidiaries that are determined to be relevant to costs
    incurred by Ameren’s rate-regulated subsidiaries with
    respect to jurisdictional rates. PUHCA 2005 also permits Ameren,
    the ICC, or the MoPSC to request that FERC review cost
    allocations by Ameren Services to other Ameren companies.

Operation of UE’s Callaway nuclear plant is subject to
    regulation by the NRC. Its facility operating license expires on
    June 11, 2024. UE’s Osage hydroelectric plant and
    UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric plant, as
    licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to
    FERC regulations affecting, among other things, the general
    operation and maintenance of the projects. The license for the
    Osage plant expired on February 28, 2006, but the plant is
    allowed to operate under this license pending FERC’s
    decision on UE’s license renewal application. In May 2005,
    the U.S. Department of the Interior and various state
    agencies reached a settlement agreement that is expected to lead
    to FERC’s relicensing of UE’s Osage plant for
    another 40 years. The settlement must be approved by FERC.
    The license for UE’s Taum Sauk plant expires on
    June 30, 2010. The Taum Sauk plant is currently out of
    service due to a major breach of the upper reservoir in December
    2005. UE’s Keokuk plant and its dam, in the
    Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois, and Keokuk, Iowa,
    are operated under open-ended authority, granted by an Act of
    Congress in 1905.

For additional information on regulatory matters, see
    Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and
    Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report, which include a discussion about the December 2005
    breach of the upper reservoir at UE’s Taum Sauk
    pumped-storage hydroelectric plant.

Environmental
    Matters

Certain of our operations are subject to federal, state, and
    local environmental statutes or regulations relating to the
    safety and health of personnel, the public, and the environment.
    These matters include identification, generation, storage,
    handling, transportation, disposal, record keeping, labeling,
    reporting, and emergency response in connection with hazardous
    and toxic materials, safety and health standards, and
    environmental protection requirements, including standards and
    limitations relating to the discharge of air and water
    pollutants. Failure to comply with those statutes or regulations
    could have material adverse effects on us. We could be subjected
    to criminal or civil penalties by regulatory agencies. We could
    be ordered to make payment to private parties by the courts.
    Except as indicated in this report, we believe that we are in
    material compliance with existing statutes and regulations.

    report.

SUPPLY FOR
    ELECTRIC POWER

During 2006, the Ameren Companies’ peak demand from retail
    and wholesale customers was 17,703 megawatts. The combined
    peak capability to deliver power from owned generation and power
    supply agreements was 20,899 megawatts. Ameren-owned
    generation and purchased power currently meet the energy needs
    of UE, Genco, AERG and Marketing Company customers, with the
    required reserve margins. Power for the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities is purchased through an

ICC-approved

auction that was first held in September 2006. Factors that
    could cause us to purchase power include, among other things,
    absence of sufficient owned generation, plant outages, the
    failure of suppliers to meet their power supply obligations,
    extreme weather conditions, and the availability of power at a
    cost lower than the cost of generating it.

Effective January 1, 2006, Ameren became a member of SERC,
    a regional electric reliability organization. SERC is
    responsible for promoting, coordinating and ensuring the
    reliability and adequacy of the bulk electric power supply
    system in much of the southeastern United States, including
    portions of Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee,
    North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama,
    Louisiana, Virginia, Florida, and Texas. The Ameren membership
    covers UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. Ameren was previously a member of
    MAIN, which ceased operations on January 1, 2006.

Before the termination of the JDA on December 31, 2006, the
    bulk power system of UE, CIPS and Genco operated as a single
    control area and transmission system,



and CILCO and IP operated as separate control areas. On
    July 7, 2006, UE, CIPS and Genco mutually agreed to
    terminate the JDA on December 31, 2006. This action was
    accepted by the FERC in September 2006. In conjunction with
    terminating the JDA, Ameren’s transmission-owning entities
    restructured their control areas into one control area in
    Missouri for UE’s transmission facilities and one in
    Illinois for the transmission facilities of CIPS, CILCO and IP.
    See Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and
    Note 13 – Related Party Transactions to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report for more information on the JDA. In 2006, we had at least
    18 direct connections with other control areas for the
    exchange of electric energy, some directly and some through the
    facilities of others. EEI operates a separate control area in
    southern Illinois. EEI’s transmission system is directly
    connected to MISO and TVA. EEI’s generating units are
    dispatched separately from those of UE, Genco and AERG. UE,
    CIPS, CILCO and IP are transmission-owning members of the MISO,
    and they have transferred functional control of their systems to
    the MISO. Transmission service on the UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP
    transmission systems is provided pursuant to the terms of the
    MISO OATT on file with FERC. See Note 3 – Rate
    and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report for further
    information.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE’s electric supply is obtained primarily from its own
    generation. In March 2006, UE completed the purchase of three CT
    facilities, totaling 1,490 megawatts of capacity at a price
    of $292 million. These purchases were designed to help meet
    UE’s increased generating capacity needs and to provide UE
    with additional flexibility in determining when to add future
    baseload generating capacity. UE expects the addition of these
    CT facilities to satisfy demand growth until about 2018. In the
    meantime, UE will be evaluating baseload electric generating
    plant options, including coal-fired, nuclear, pumped-storage and
    integrated gasification combined cycle coal technology. See
    Note 2 – Acquisitions to our financial statements
    under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion
    of the CT facilities purchases.

Illinois
    Regulated

CIPS, CILCO and IP own no generation facilities. CIPS bought
    power from Genco, and CILCO bought power from AERG, both under
    contracts that expired at the end of 2006. IP’s primary
    power supply contract with Dynegy also expired at the end of
    2006. In connection with the expiration of the power supply
    agreements, the ICC approved an auction framework to allow
    electric utilities in Illinois, including CIPS, CILCO and IP, to
    procure power for use by their customers in 2007. The power
    procurement auction was held in September 2006. See
    Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and
    Note 13 – Related Party Transactions to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report for a discussion of the ICC-approved power procurement
    auction.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

In December 2005, EEI entered into a power supply agreement with
    Marketing Company, whereby EEI sells 100% of its capacity and
    energy to Marketing Company. Commencing in 2007, Genco and AERG
    are also selling power to Marketing Company. Marketing Company
    sold power through the Illinois power procurement auction to
    CIPS, CILCO and IP and is selling power through other contracts
    with wholesale and retail customers. See Note 3 –
    Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 13 – Related
    Party Transactions to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of
    power supply agreements.

Coal

UE, Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI have agreements in place to
    purchase coal and to transport it to electric generating
    facilities through 2011. UE, Genco, AERG and EEI expect to enter
    into additional contracts to purchase coal. Coal supply
    agreements typically have an initial term of five years, with
    about 20% of the contracts expiring annually. As of
    December 31, 2006, 100% of UE’s, Genco’s,
    AERG’s and EEI’s expected 2007 coal usage was under
    contract, and about 54% of the expected coal usage for 2008 to
    2011 was under contract. Ameren burned 40 million
    (UE – 23 million, Genco –
    8 million, AERG – 4 million, EEI –
    5 million) tons of coal in 2006.

More than 90% of Ameren’s coal is purchased from the Powder
    River Basin in Wyoming. The remaining coal is purchased from the
    Illinois Basin. UE, Genco, AERG and EEI have a policy to
    maintain coal inventory consistent with their projected usage.
    Inventory may be adjusted because of uncertainties of supply due
    to potential work stoppages, delays in coal deliveries,
    equipment breakdowns, and other factors. As of December 31,
    2006, coal inventories for UE, Genco, AERG and EEI were adequate
    and consistent with historical levels, but below targeted levels
    due to rail deliveries from the Powder River Basin below
    requested levels. Disruptions in deliveries of coal could cause
    UE, Genco, AERG and EEI to incur higher costs for fuel and
    purchased power and could reduce their interchange sales.

Nuclear

Fuel assemblies for the 2007 spring refueling are already at
    UE’s Callaway nuclear plant. UE also has agreements or
    inventories to meet 61% of Callaway’s 2008 to 2011
    requirements. UE expects to enter into additional contracts to
    purchase nuclear fuel. Prices cannot be accurately predicted at
    this time. UE is a member of Fuelco, which allows UE to join
    with other member companies to increase its purchasing power and
    opportunities for volume discounts. The Callaway nuclear plant
    normally requires refueling at

18-month

intervals. The last refueling was



completed in November 2005. The next refueling is scheduled for
    April 2007.

Natural Gas
    Supply for Power Generation

Ameren’s portfolio of natural gas supply resources includes
    firm transportation capacity, and firm no-notice storage
    capacity leased from interstate pipelines to maintain gas
    deliveries to our gas-fired generating units throughout the
    year, especially during the summer peak demand. UE, Genco and
    EEI primarily use the interstate pipeline systems of Panhandle
    Eastern Pipe Line Company, Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas
    Pipeline Company of America, and Mississippi River Transmission
    Corporation to transport natural gas to generating units. In
    addition to physical transactions, Ameren uses financial
    instruments, including some in the NYMEX futures market and some
    in the OTC financial markets, to hedge the price paid for
    natural gas.

UE’s, Genco’s and EEI’s natural gas procurement
    strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery
    of natural gas to their generating units. UE, Genco and EEI do
    this in two ways. UE, Genco and EEI optimize transportation and
    storage options and minimize cost and price risk through various
    supply and price hedging agreements that allow them to maintain
    access to multiple gas pools, supply basins, and storage. As of
    December 31, 2006, UE had about 39% and Genco had 100% of
    its required gas supply for generation for 2007 hedged for price
    risk. For 2008 to 2011, UE has 1% of its estimated required
    natural gas supply for generation hedged for price risk, and
    Genco has 7% hedged. As of December 31, 2006, EEI did not
    have any of its required gas supply for generation hedged for
    price risk.

Purchased
    Power

We believe that we can obtain enough purchased power to meet
    future needs. However, during periods of high demand, the price
    and availability of purchased power may be significantly
    affected. The Ameren transmission system has a minimum of 18
    direct connections to other control areas, which give us access
    to numerous sources of supply. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are
    members of the MISO. The MISO Day Two Energy Market is designed
    to provide transparency of power pricing and to make generation
    dispatch efficient. The MISO Day Two Energy Market also makes
    available power from the entire MISO transmission grid.

Illinois
    Regulated

CIPS, CILCO and IP were subject to legislative electric rate
    freezes in Illinois through January 1, 2007, and had power
    supply contracts in place through December 31, 2006, to
    meet their customers’ needs. In January 2006, the ICC
    approved a power procurement auction and the related tariffs for
    the period commencing January 2, 2007, including the retail
    rates at which power supply costs would be passed through to
    customers. The power procurement auction was held at the
    beginning of September 2006. The auction was designed to procure
    the power supply needs of CIPS, CILCO and IP through a portfolio
    of

one-,

two-

and
    three-year supply agreements for residential and small
    commercial customers and one-year agreements for large
    commercial and industrial customers. Through the auction, CIPS,
    CILCO and IP acquired 100% of expected power supply requirements
    for all customers through May 31, 2008, two-thirds of
    supply requirements for residential and small commercial
    customers for June 1, 2008, through May 31, 2009, and
    one-third of the requirements for these customers for
    June 1, 2009, through May 31, 2010. See
    Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under
    Part II, Item 8, of the report for more information on
    the results of the Illinois power procurement auction. The next
    Illinois power procurement auction is scheduled for January 2008.

    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations under Part II, Item 7, Risk Factors under
    Part I, Item 1A, and Note 3 – Rate and
    Regulatory Matters, under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report for a discussion of credit rating changes issued in
    response to potential actions in Illinois that could threaten
    the financial solvency of CIPS, CILCO and IP and their ability
    to procure power.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

In December 2006, Genco and AERG each entered into separate
    power supply agreements to sell all of their generation capacity
    to Marketing Company. Both agreements began on January 1,
    2007, and will continue through December 31, 2022, and from
    year to year thereafter unless either party elects to terminate
    the agreement. In December 2005, Marketing Company entered into
    a power supply agreement with EEI, whereby EEI agreed to sell
    100% of its capacity and energy to Marketing Company. This
    agreement expires on December 30, 2015. A portion of this
    power was sold by Marketing Company into the Illinois power
    procurement auction. For additional information on the electric
    power supply agreements, see Note 13 – Related
    Party Transactions to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report.

NATURAL GAS
    SUPPLY FOR DISTRIBUTION

UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are responsible for the purchase and
    delivery of natural gas to their gas utility customers. UE,
    CIPS, CILCO and IP develop and manage a portfolio of gas supply
    resources, including firm gas supply under term agreements with
    producers, interstate and intrastate firm transportation
    capacity, firm storage capacity leased from interstate
    pipelines, and on-system storage facilities to maintain gas
    deliveries to our customers throughout the year and especially
    during peak demand. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP primarily use the
    Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, the Trunkline Gas Company,
    the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, the Mississippi
    River Transmission Corporation, and the Texas Eastern
    Transmission Corporation interstate pipeline systems to
    transport natural gas to their systems. In addition to physical
    transactions, financial instruments including those entered into
    in the NYMEX futures market and in the OTC



financial markets are used to hedge the price paid for natural
    gas. Prudently incurred natural gas purchase costs are passed on
    to UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP gas customers in Illinois and Missouri

dollar-for-dollar

under PGA clauses, subject to prudency review by the ICC and the
    MoPSC.

INDUSTRY
    ISSUES

We are facing issues common to the electric and gas utility
    industry and the non-rate-regulated electric generation
    industry. These issues include:

•

political and regulatory resistance to higher rates;

•

the potential for changes in laws and regulation;

•

the potential for more intense competition in generation and
    supply;

•

changes in the structure of the industry as a result of changes
    in federal and state laws, including the formation of
    non-rate-regulated generating entities and RTOs;

•

fluctuations in power prices due to the balance of supply and
    demand and fuel prices;

•

availability of fuel and increases in prices;

•

rising labor and material costs;

•

continually developing and complex environmental laws,
    regulations and issues, including new air-quality standards,
    mercury regulations, and possible greenhouse gas limitations;

•

public concern about the siting of new facilities;

•

construction of new power generating and transmission facilities;

•

proposals for programs to encourage energy efficiency and
    renewable sources of power;

•

public concerns about nuclear plant operation and
    decommissioning and the disposal of nuclear waste;

•

consolidation of electric and gas companies; and

•

global climate issues.

We are monitoring these issues. We are unable to predict what
    impact, if any, these issues will have on our results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity. For additional
    information, see Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A,

ITEM 1A.
    RISK FACTORS

The electric and gas rates that UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are
    allowed to charge are currently the subject of rate case
    proceedings and potential legislative action. The outcome of
    these proceedings and of other potential legislative action or
    future rate proceedings is largely outside of our control.
    Should these events result in the inability of UE, CIPS, CILCO
    or IP to recover their respective costs and earn an appropriate
    return on investment, it could have a material adverse effect on
    our future results of operations, financial position, or
    liquidity. In particular, we believe freezing electric rates at
    2006 levels in Illinois would lead to CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and
    IP being financially insolvent.

The rates that certain Ameren Companies are allowed to charge
    for their services are the single most important item
    influencing the results of operations, financial position, or
    liquidity of the Ameren Companies. The electric and gas utility
    industry is highly regulated. The regulation of the rates that
    we charge our customers is determined, in large part, by
    governmental entities outside of our control, including the
    MoPSC, the ICC, and FERC. Decisions made by these entities could
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

Increased costs and investments, when combined with rate
    reductions and moratoriums, have caused decreased returns in
    Ameren’s utility businesses. Ameren expects that many of
    its operating expenses will continue to rise. Ameren further
    expects to continue to make significant investment in its energy
    infrastructure. These are the two principal factors underlying
    the pending rate increase requests with the MoPSC and the rate
    increase requests recently acted upon and pending rehearing with
    the ICC. We cannot predict the outcome of these rate case
    proceedings or of potential Illinois legislative action to deny
    full recovery of costs. In addition, in response to competitive,
    economic, political, legislative and regulatory pressures, in
    connection with the resolution of our current rate case
    proceedings or otherwise, we may be subject to further rate
    moratoriums, rate refunds, limits on rate increases, or rate
    reductions, including phase-in plans. Any or all of these could
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.



Illinois

Electric Delivery
    Service Rate Cases

A provision of the Illinois Customer Choice Law related to the
    restructuring of the Illinois electric industry put a rate
    freeze into effect through January 1, 2007, for CIPS, CILCO
    and IP. CIPS, CILCO and IP filed rate cases with the ICC in
    December 2005 to modify their electric delivery service rates
    effective January 2, 2007. CIPS, CILCO and IP requested to
    increase their annual revenues for electric delivery service by
    $202 million in the aggregate (CIPS –
    $14 million, CILCO – $43 million and
    IP – $145 million). In November 2006, the ICC
    issued an order that approved an aggregate revenue increase of
    $97 million effective January 2, 2007
    (CIPS – an $8 million decrease, CILCO –
    a $21 million increase and IP – an
    $84 million increase) based on an allowed return on equity
    of 10%. In December 2006, the ICC granted the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ petition for rehearing of the November 2006
    order on the recovery of certain administrative and general
    expenses, totaling $50 million, that were disallowed. The
    ICC’s decision on the recovery of these expenses is due in
    May 2007. The ICC denied requests for rehearings filed by other
    parties in this case. Because of the ICC’s cost
    disallowances and regulatory lag, the Ameren Illinois Utilities
    are not expected to earn their allowed return on equity of 10%
    in 2007. Most customers were taking service under a frozen
    bundled electric rate in 2006, which includes the cost of power,
    so these delivery service revenue changes will not directly
    correspond to a change in CIPS’, CILCO’s or IP’s
    revenues or earnings under the new electric delivery service
    rates that became effective January 2, 2007.

Potential
    Electric Rate Freeze and Recovery of

Post-2006

Power Supply Costs

Consistent with the Illinois Customer Choice Law that froze
    electric rates for CIPS, CILCO and IP through January 1,
    2007, these companies entered into power supply contracts that
    expired on December 31, 2006. In January 2006, the ICC
    approved a framework for CIPS, CILCO and IP to procure power for
    use by their customers through an auction. It also approved the
    related tariffs to collect these costs from customers for the
    period commencing January 2, 2007. This approval is subject
    to pending court appeals. In accordance with the January 2006
    ICC order, a power procurement auction was held in September
    2006.

Subsequently, the ICC determined that it would not investigate
    the results of the auction to procure power for fixed-price
    customers, and the independent auction manager declared a
    successful result in the auction for these fixed-price
    customers, which include the vast majority of electric customers
    of CIPS, CILCO and IP. Certain Illinois legislators, the
    Illinois attorney general, the Illinois governor, and other
    parties sought to block the power procurement auction. They
    continue to challenge the auction and the structure for the
    recovery of costs for power supply resulting from the auction
    through rates to customers. In February 2006, legislation was
    introduced in the Illinois House of Representatives that would
    have extended the electric rate freeze in Illinois at 2006
    levels through 2010. On October 2, 2006, Speaker of the
    Illinois House of Representatives Michael Madigan sent a letter
    to Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich asking the Illinois
    governor to call a special session of the Illinois General
    Assembly to consider this rate freeze legislation. The governor
    sent a letter indicating that once the votes to pass the
    legislation were in place, he would immediately call for a
    special session of the legislature. The governor’s letter
    further provided that if a consensus among members of the
    general assembly could not be reached in the near future, he
    would call a special session as well. The governor’s letter
    stated that he continued to support legislation extending the
    rate freeze and would like to sign it into law as soon as
    possible. No special session was called in 2006. During the
    Illinois General Assembly’s session that ended in January
    2007, the Illinois House of Representatives passed legislation
    to freeze rates at 2006 levels through 2010, and the Illinois
    Senate passed legislation containing an electric rate increase
    phase-in plan. The Illinois Senate bill provided for a mandatory
    phase-in of the 2007 increase in residential electric rates over
    a three-year period. Neither piece of legislation was passed by
    the other chamber before the end of the session in early January
    2007.

Any legislative measure will need to be approved by the Illinois
    House of Representatives and Illinois Senate, and signed by the
    Illinois governor before it can become law. New rates for CIPS,
    CILCO and IP reflecting the power costs resulting from the
    ICC-approved September 2006 auction and the delivery service
    rates authorized by the November 2006 ICC order became effective
    January 2, 2007. A new Illinois General Assembly went into
    session in late January 2007. As a result, all previous bills
    expired. New bills have been introduced during the current
    legislative session, including legislation to rollback rates to
    2006 levels similar to previously proposed legislation. On
    February 27, 2007, the Ameren Illinois Utilities announced
    that they intended to file an electric rate increase mitigation
    plan with the ICC. As part of the plan, which is subject to ICC
    approval, the Ameren Illinois Utilities would fund an
    approximate $20 million one-time reduction to active
    residential accounts that would appear on electric bills in
    March and April 2007. The rate mitigation plan is targeted to
    customers with high volume usage. As part of the filing, the
    carrying charge of 3.25% in the current ICC-approved phase-in
    plan would be eliminated. If approved by the ICC, the one-time
    credit for residential customers would result in a charge to
    Ameren’s earnings in 2007 of $20 million, or 6 cents
    per share. In addition, eliminating the below-market interest
    rate on deferred amounts under the phase-in plan would increase
    financing costs for the Ameren Illinois Utilities during the
    deferral period. The actual cost to Ameren will depend on the
    level of participation in the phase-in plan.

CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP believe that legislation freezing
    electric rates at 2006 levels, if enacted, would have a material
    adverse effect on their results of operations, financial
    position, and liquidity, including the financial insolvency of
    CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP. They believe it could cause
    significant job losses and, without governmental intervention,
    significant disruptions in electric and gas



service. Since Ameren’s Illinois utilities own no
    generation facilities, the companies must purchase power on the
    competitive market to meet customers’ energy needs. If
    electric rates were to be frozen at 2006 levels, the major
    credit rating agencies have stated that the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ credit ratings would be downgraded to deep junk
    (or speculative) status. Such a downgrade of CILCO’s
    ratings would also result in a similar downgrade of
    CILCORP’s ratings. We believe that CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and
    IP would be faced with potential collateral and prepayment
    requirements for products and services, such as natural gas, and
    would eventually run out of cash and available credit and be
    unable to borrow. We believe that this would cause the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities and CILCORP to become financially insolvent.
    In reaction to intensified political discussion in Illinois
    regarding electric rate freeze extension legislation, in October
    2006, S&P downgraded the short- and long-term credit ratings
    of the Ameren Companies and kept the Ameren Companies on credit
    watch with negative implications; Moody’s placed the
    long-term debt ratings of the Ameren Companies under review for
    possible downgrade; and Fitch placed the ratings of Ameren,
    CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP on rating watch negative.

CIPS, CILCO and IP strongly believe that freezing rates at 2006
    levels in Illinois would not be in the best interests of any of
    the Ameren Illinois Utilities or their customers. In December
    2006, the ICC approved a constructive rate increase phase-in
    plan proposed by CILCO, CIPS and IP for residential, small
    commercial, and eligible local governmental and school customers
    to address the significant increases in customer rates for the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities beginning in 2007. However, if the
    Illinois legislature passes rate phase-in legislation that does
    not allow for the full and timely recovery of costs, it could
    have a material adverse effect on CIPS’, CILCORP’s,
    CILCO’s and IP’s results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity.

Ameren, CIPS, CILCO and IP will continue to explore a number of
    legal and regulatory actions, strategies, and alternatives to
    address these Illinois electric issues. CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and
    IP expect to take whatever actions are necessary to protect
    their legal and financial interests, including seeking the
    protection of the bankruptcy courts. However, there can be no
    assurance that Ameren and the Ameren Illinois Utilities will
    prevail over the stated opposition of certain Illinois
    legislators, the Illinois attorney general, the Illinois
    governor, and other stakeholders, or that the legal and
    regulatory actions, strategies and alternatives that Ameren and
    the Ameren Illinois Utilities are considering will be successful.

We are unable to predict the results of the court appeals of the
    January 2006 ICC order approving CIPS’, CILCO’s and
    IP’s power procurement auction and the related tariffs. Nor
    can we predict the actions the Illinois General Assembly and
    governor may take that may affect electric rates or the power
    procurement process for CIPS, CILCO and IP. Any decision or
    action that impairs the ability of CIPS, CILCO and IP to fully
    recover purchased power or distribution costs from their
    electric customers in a timely manner would result in material
    adverse consequences to Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP.
    These consequences could include a significant drop in credit
    ratings to deep junk (or speculative) status, a loss of access
    to the capital markets, higher borrowing costs, higher power
    supply costs, an inability to make timely energy infrastructure
    investments, significant risk of disruption in electric and gas
    service, significant job losses, and financial insolvency. In
    addition, Ameren, CILCORP and IP could be required to record a
    charge for goodwill impairment for the goodwill that was
    recorded when Ameren acquired CILCORP and IP. As of
    December 31, 2006, Ameren had $830 million, CILCORP
    $542 million and IP $213 million of goodwill on their
    balance sheets. Furthermore, if the Ameren Illinois Utilities
    are unable to recover their costs from customers, the utilities
    could be required to cease applying SFAS No. 71,
    “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
    Regulation,” which allows CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP to
    defer certain costs pursuant to actions of rate regulators and
    to recover such costs in rates charged to customers. This would
    result in the elimination of all regulatory assets recorded by
    CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP on their balance sheets and a
    one-time extraordinary charge on their statements of income that
    could be material. As of December 31, 2006, CIPS had
    $146 million, CILCORP $75 million, CILCO
    $75 million and IP $401 million recorded as regulatory
    assets on their balance sheets.

Missouri

With the expiration of multiyear electric and gas rate
    moratoriums, effective July 1, 2006, UE filed requests with
    the MoPSC in July 2006 for an electric rate increase of
    $361 million and for a natural gas delivery rate increase
    of $11 million. In December 2006, the MoPSC staff and other
    stakeholders filed direct testimony in response to UE’s
    rate case filings. The MoPSC staff recommended in their
    testimony an electric rate reduction of $136 million to
    $168 million and a gas rate increase of $2 million to
    $3 million. During the course of the rate proceeding,
    parties to the case may change their positions. A decision from
    the MoPSC is expected no later than June 2007. Any change in
    electric or gas rates may not directly correspond to a change in
    UE’s earnings.

UE does not currently have a rate-adjustment clause for its
    electric operations in Missouri that would allow it to recover
    from customers the costs for purchased power, fuel, or
    infrastructure investment. Therefore, insofar as UE has not
    hedged its fuel and power costs, UE is exposed to changes in
    fuel and power prices to the extent they exceed the costs
    embedded in current electric rates. In its Missouri electric
    rate case filed in July 2006, UE requested a fuel and purchased
    power cost recovery mechanism that would be subject to MoPSC
    approval. The MoPSC staff and intervenors in the electric rate
    case have recommended that UE not be granted the right to use
    such a mechanism. UE also requested an environmental
    cost-recovery mechanism as part of its pending Missouri electric
    rate case, but no rules have been established for such a
    mechanism. Any new energy infrastructure investment could result
    in increased



financing requirements for UE, which could increase further
    depending on rate case outcomes. The lack of timely recovery of
    these costs could have a material adverse effect on UE’s
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. We are
    unable to predict whether the MoPSC will approve our request for
    a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism in our
    pending electric rate case. We also are unable to predict when
    rules implementing the environmental cost recovery mechanism
    will be formally proposed and adopted.

If Illinois electric rates are frozen at 2006 levels or if
    the ability of CIPS, CILCO and IP to recover post-2006 power
    supply costs or increase electric delivery service rates is
    otherwise impaired, there may be a material adverse effect on
    Ameren, UE and Genco in addition to the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities and CILCORP.

We believe that freezing electric rates at 2006 levels in
    Illinois would cause CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP to become
    financially insolvent. Although the Ameren Companies are
    separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses,
    assets and liabilities, there is a risk that the financial
    insolvency of CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP could have a
    materially adverse effect on Ameren, UE and Genco. If rates are
    frozen at 2006 levels in Illinois for CIPS, CILCO and IP, or if
    the ability of CIPS, CILCO and IP to recover post-2006 power
    supply costs or increase electric delivery service rates is
    otherwise impaired, such events might increase Ameren’s,
    UE’s and Genco’s cost of capital or adversely affect
    the ability of these companies to access the capital markets,
    particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets,
    which could negatively affect their ability to maintain and
    expand their businesses. Moody’s, S&P and Fitch each
    have indicated that they would lower the credit ratings for
    CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP to deep junk (or speculative)
    status, if electric rates were frozen at 2006 levels, reflecting
    the material impact such action would have on the cash flow and
    liquidity of these companies. It is possible that the rating
    agencies could decide to lower the credit ratings of Ameren, UE
    or Genco at the same time. Any adverse change in the ratings of
    Ameren, UE or Genco could also increase their cost of borrowing
    under existing credit facilities, and suppliers might begin to
    request prepayment for products and services (such as fuel,
    power and gas) or the posting of collateral.

If CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP become insolvent, their
    commitments to Ameren, Genco and AERG might be unfulfilled.
    Pursuant to agreements executed in connection with the recent
    Illinois power procurement auction, Marketing Company is selling
    to CIPS, CILCO and IP power that is being supplied under
    contracts from Genco and AERG. If CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP
    become insolvent, Genco, AERG or Marketing Company may not be
    able to recover the cost of power delivered to those companies
    but not paid for prior to insolvency. Marketing Company’s
    commitments to sell power to CIPS, CILCO, IP and other
    unaffiliated parties also rely, in part, on power supplied by
    AERG. In the event of financial insolvency, AERG may not be able
    to deliver power it has committed to sell to Marketing Company;
    that could force Marketing Company to acquire the power to meet
    its commitments at a higher cost.

In addition, dividends on Ameren’s common stock and the
    payment of Ameren’s other obligations, including its debt,
    depend on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. If CIPS,
    CILCORP, CILCO and IP should become insolvent, they will not be
    able to make distributions to Ameren. Additionally, if CIPS,
    CILCORP, CILCO and IP fall below investment grade in ratings of
    their securities, they will be limited in the amount of
    dividends they may pay. As a result, the board of directors of
    Ameren might decide to rely more heavily on UE and Ameren’s
    unregulated operations to support dividends on Ameren’s
    common stock, or to reduce or eliminate the payment of
    dividends. Moreover, the absence of distributions from the
    Illinois utilities and CILCORP could force Ameren to use other
    available sources of liquidity to service its debt obligations.

We cannot determine at this time whether the freezing of rates
    at 2006 levels in Illinois that would lead to CIPS, CILCORP,
    CILCO and IP insolvency will occur. We also cannot determine
    what the resulting effect would be on Ameren, UE and Genco.
    However, the financial insolvency of CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP
    could have a material adverse effect on the results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity of Ameren, UE and
    Genco.

Our counterparties may not meet their obligations to us.

We are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various
    arrangements (including our affiliates) who owe us money,
    energy, coal or other commodities or services will not be able
    to perform their obligations. Should the counterparties to these
    arrangements fail to perform, we might be forced to replace or
    to sell the underlying commitment at then-current market prices.
    In such event, we might incur losses, or our results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity could otherwise be
    adversely affected.

Increased federal and state environmental regulation will
    require UE, Genco, CILCO (through AERG) and EEI to incur large
    capital expenditures and to incur increased operating costs.
    Future limits on greenhouse gas emissions could result in
    significant increases in capital and operating expenditures.

About 61% of Ameren’s generating capacity is coal-fired and
    about 85% of its electric generation was produced by its
    coal-fired plants in 2006. The rest is nuclear, gas-fired,
    hydroelectric, and oil-fired. In May 2005, the EPA issued final
    regulations with respect to
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The new
    rules require significant additional reductions in these
    emissions from UE, Genco, AERG and EEI power plants in phases,
    beginning in 2009. Preliminary estimates of capital compliance
    costs for Ameren, UE, Genco and AERG range from
    $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion by 2016.

The Missouri Department of Natural Resources formally proposed
    rules to implement the federal Clean Air Mercury and Clean Air
    Interstate Rules in November 2006. Missouri



rules are similar to the federal rules. The Missouri Air
    Conservation Commission approved the rules at their February
    2007 meeting. The rules will be effective after publication in
    the Missouri Register targeted for April 2007. The rules will
    also need to be approved by the EPA. If approved, these rules
    when fully implemented are expected to reduce mercury emissions
    81% by 2018 and to reduce
    NO

x

emissions 30% and
    SO


emissions 75% by 2015.

Illinois has proposed rules to implement the federal Clean Air
    Interstate Rule program; however it is anticipated that the
    rules will not be finalized until the second quarter of 2007.
    The Illinois EPA proposed rules for mercury that are
    significantly stricter than the federal rules. Illinois has also
    proposed Clean Air Interstate Rule program rules for
    NO

x

that are more stringent than the federal program. In 2006,
    Genco, AERG, EEI, and the Illinois EPA entered into an agreement
    on Illinois’ mercury rules. Under the agreement, Illinois
    generators may delay the compliance date for mercury reductions
    in exchange for accelerated installation of
    NO

x

and
    SO


controls. The agreement with the Illinois EPA also restricts the
    purchase of
    SO


and
    NO

x

emission allowances to meet specific allowed emission rates set
    forth in the agreement. The Illinois Joint Committee on
    Administrative Review approved the Illinois mercury rule in
    December 2006, and the Illinois Pollution Control Board issued a
    final order and adopted the mercury rule in late December 2006.
    The final rule was published in the Illinois Register in January
    2007. The rule will also need to be approved by the EPA. When
    fully implemented, these rules are expected to reduce mercury
    emissions 90%,
    NO

x

emissions 50% and
    SO


emissions 70% by 2015.

Future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global
    warming continue to be the subject of much debate. As a result
    of our diverse fuel portfolio, our contribution to greenhouse
    gases varies among our generating facilities. Coal-fired power
    plants, however, are significant sources of carbon dioxide, a
    principal greenhouse gas. Six electric power sector trade
    associations, including the Edison Electric Institute, of which
    Ameren is a member, and the TVA, signed a Memorandum of
    Understanding (MOU) with the DOE in December 2004 calling for a
    3% to 5% voluntary decrease in carbon intensity by the utility
    sector between 2002 and 2012. Currently, Ameren is considering
    various initiatives to comply with the MOU, including increased
    generation at nuclear and hydroelectric power plants, increased
    efficiency measures at our coal-fired units, and investments in
    renewable energy and carbon sequestration projects. Future
    legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission
    of greenhouse gases would result in significant increases in
    capital expenditures and operating costs. Mandatory limits could
    have a material adverse impact on Ameren’s, UE’s,
    Genco’s, AERG’s and EEI’s results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

The EPA has been conducting an enforcement initiative to
    determine whether modifications at a number of coal-fired power
    plants owned by electric utilities in the United States are
    subject to New Source Review requirements or New Source
    Performance Standards under the Clean Air Act. The EPA’s
    inquiries focus on whether the best available emission control
    technology was or should have been used at such power plants
    when major maintenance or capital improvements were made.

In April 2005, Genco received a request from the EPA for
    information pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air
    Act, seeking detailed operating and maintenance history data
    with respect to its Meredosia, Hutsonville, Coffeen and Newton
    facilities, EEI’s Joppa facility, and AERG’s E.D.
    Edwards and Duck Creek facilities. In December 2006, the EPA
    issued a second Section 114(a) request to Genco regarding
    projects at the Newton facility. All of these facilities are
    coal-fired plants. Genco is asked to respond to specific EPA
    questions about certain projects and maintenance activities in
    order to determine compliance with certain Illinois air
    pollution and emissions rules and with the New Source
    Performance Standards required by the Clean Air Act. These
    information requests are being complied with, but we cannot
    predict the outcome of this matter.

We are unable to predict the ultimate effect of any new
    environmental regulations, voluntary compliance guidelines,
    enforcement initiatives, or legislation on our results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity. Any of these
    factors could result in a significant increase in capital
    expenditures, closure of power plants, penalties and operating
    costs for UE, Genco, CILCO (through AERG) and EEI. Therefore,
    such factors could also result in decreased revenues, increased
    financing requirements and increased costs for these Ameren
    companies. Although costs incurred by UE would be eligible for
    recovery in rates over time, subject to MoPSC approval in a rate
    proceeding, there is no similar mechanism for recovery of costs
    by Genco, AERG or EEI in Illinois.

Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit
    retirement plans, health care plans, and other employee-related
    benefits may adversely affect our results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

We offer defined benefit and postretirement plans that cover
    substantially all of our employees. Assumptions related to
    future costs, returns on investments, interest rates, and other
    actuarial matters have a significant impact on our earnings and
    funding requirements. Based on our assumptions at
    December 31, 2006, and the new contribution requirements in
    the Pension Protection Act of 2006, in order to maintain minimum
    funding levels for Ameren’s pension plans, we do not expect
    future contributions to be required until 2009 at which time we
    would expect to pay a required contribution of $100 million
    to $150 million. Required contributions of
    $150 million to $200 million each year are also
    expected for 2010 and 2011. We expect the companies to share
    future funding requirements as follows: UE – 61%;
    CIPS – 10%; Genco – 11%; CILCO –
    7%; and IP – 11%. These amounts are estimates. They
    may change with actual stock market performance, changes in
    interest rates, any pertinent changes in government regulations,
    and any voluntary contributions.



In addition to the costs of our retirement plans, the costs of
    providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees
    have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that
    our employee benefit costs, including costs of health care plans
    for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.
    The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with
    our defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans, and
    other employee benefits may adversely affect our results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity.

UE’s, Genco’s, AERG’s, Medina Valley’s
    and EEI’s electric generating facilities are subject to
    operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant
    outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses,
    liability, and increased purchased power costs.

UE, Genco, AERG, Medina Valley, and EEI own and operate
    coal-fired, nuclear, gas-fired, hydroelectric, and oil-fired
    generating facilities. Operation of electric generating
    facilities involves certain risks that can adversely affect
    energy output and efficiency levels. Among these risks are:

•

increased prices for fuel and fuel transportation;

•

facility shutdowns due to a failure of equipment or processes or
    operator error;

•

longer-than-anticipated

maintenance outages;

•

disruptions in the delivery of fuel and lack of adequate
    inventories;

•

labor disputes;

•

inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements;

•

disruptions in the delivery of electricity;

•

increased capital expenditure requirements, including those due
    to environmental regulation;

•

unusual or adverse weather conditions; and

•

catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods, or other
    similar occurrences affecting electric generating facilities.

The breach of the upper reservoir of UE’s Taum Sauk
    pumped-storage hydroelectric facility could continue to have an
    adverse effect on Ameren’s and UE’s results of
    operations, liquidity, and financial condition.

In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at
    UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility. This
    resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which
    damaged a state park.

The FERC investigation of the incident has been completed. In
    October 2006, the FERC approved a stipulation and consent
    agreement between UE and the FERC’s Office of Enforcement
    that resolves all issues arising from an investigation by the
    FERC’s Office of Enforcement. They looked into alleged
    violations of license conditions and FERC regulations by UE as
    the licensee of the Taum Sauk hydroelectric facility that may
    have contributed to the breach of the upper reservoir. As part
    of the stipulation and consent agreement, UE agreed, among other
    things, (1) to pay a civil penalty of $10 million,
    (2) to pay $5 million into an interest-bearing escrow
    account to fund project enhancements at or near the Taum Sauk
    facility, and (3) to implement and comply with a new dam
    safety program developed in connection with the settlement.

In December 2006, the state of Missouri, through its attorney
    general and 10 business owners filed separate lawsuits regarding
    the Taum Sauk breach. The attorney general’s lawsuit, which
    was filed in the Missouri circuit court in St. Louis,
    alleges negligence, violations of the Missouri Clean Water Act,
    and various other statutory and common law claims. The business
    owners’ suit, which was filed in the Missouri circuit court
    in Reynolds County, contains similar allegations. It seeks
    damages relating to business losses and lost profit. Both suits
    seek unspecified punitive damages. In January 2007, the Missouri
    Department of Natural Resources filed a petition to intervene as
    a plaintiff in the attorney general’s lawsuit.

In February 2007, UE submitted plans and an environmental report
    to FERC to rebuild the upper reservoir at its Taum Sauk Plant,
    assuming successful resolution of outstanding issues with
    agencies of the state of Missouri. Should the decision be made
    to rebuild the Taum Sauk plant, UE would expect it to be out of
    service through at least the middle of 2009, if not longer. In
    2005, the Taum Sauk facility provided 589,000 megawatthours of
    electricity.

To the extent that UE needs to purchase power because of the
    unavailability of the Taum Sauk facility, there is the risk that
    UE will not be permitted to recover these additional costs from
    ratepayers if such a request is made. The Taum Sauk incident is
    expected to reduce Ameren’s and UE’s 2007 pretax
    earnings by $15 million to $20 million as a result of
    higher-cost sources of power, reduced interchange sales, and
    increased expenses, net of insurance reimbursement for
    replacement power costs. In addition, there is also the risk
    that UE will not be permitted to rebuild the Taum Sauk facility
    upper reservoir. UE could be required to expense its remaining
    investment in the plant of $64 million immediately.

At this time, excluding fines and penalties, UE believes that
    substantially all of the damage and liabilities caused by the
    breach will be covered by insurance. Under UE’s insurance
    policies, all claims by UE are subject to review by its
    insurance carriers. Until the reviews conducted by state
    authorities have concluded, litigation has been resolved, the
    insurance review is completed, a final decision about whether
    the plant will be rebuilt is made, and future regulatory
    treatment for the plant is determined, among other things, we
    are unable to determine the impact the breach may have on
    Ameren’s and UE’s results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity beyond those amounts already recognized.

Genco’s, AERG’s, and EEI’s electric generating
    facilities must compete for the sale of energy and capacity,
    which exposes them to price risk.

As of December 31, 2006, Genco and CILCO (through AERG)
    owned non-rate-regulated electric generating facilities with
    capacities of 4,222 megawatts and 1,138 megawatts, respectively.
    During 2006, most of Genco’s and AERG’s wholesale and
    retail electric power supply agreements



expired. As a result, Genco and AERG now compete for the sale of
    energy and capacity through Marketing Company.

As of December 31, 2006, EEI owned 1,055 megawatts of
    non-rate-regulated electric generating facilities. On
    December 31, 2005, EEI’s power supply contract with
    its affiliates, including UE, CIPS and IP, expired. All of
    EEI’s generating capacity now competes for the sale of
    energy and capacity through Marketing Company.

To the extent that electric capacity generated by these
    facilities is not under contract to be sold, the revenues and
    results of operations of these non-rate-regulated subsidiaries
    generally depend on the prices that they can obtain for energy
    and capacity in Illinois and adjacent markets. Among the factors
    that could influence such prices (all of which are beyond our
    control to a significant degree) are:

•

the current and future market prices for natural gas, fuel oil,
    and coal;

•

current and forward prices for the sale of electricity;

•

the extent of additional supplies of electric energy from
    current competitors or new market entrants;

•

the regulatory and pricing structures developed for evolving
    Midwest energy markets and the pace at which regional markets
    for energy and capacity develop outside of bilateral contracts;

•

changes enacted by the ICC with respect to power procurement
    procedures;

•

future pricing for, and availability of, services on
    transmission systems, and the effect of RTOs and export energy
    transmission constraints, which could limit our ability to sell
    energy in markets adjacent to Illinois;

•

the growth rate in electricity usage as a result of population
    changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of
    conservation programs;

•

climate conditions in the Midwest market; and

•

environmental laws and regulations.

UE’s ownership and operation of a nuclear generating
    facility creates business, financial, and waste disposal
    risks.

UE owns the Callaway nuclear plant, which represents about 12%
    of UE’s generation capacity and produced 13% of UE’s
    2006 generation. Therefore, UE is subject to the risks of
    nuclear generation, which include the following:

•

potential harmful effects on the environment and human health
    resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the
    storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;

•

the availability of a permanent waste storage site;

•

limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially
    available to cover losses that might arise in connection with
    UE’s nuclear operations or those of others in the United
    States;

•

uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment
    amounts if insurance coverage is inadequate;

•

increased public and governmental concerns over the adequacy of
    security at nuclear power plants;

•

uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial
    aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their
    licensed lives (UE’s facility operating license for the
    Callaway nuclear plant expires in 2024);

•

limited availability of fuel supply; and

•

costly and extended outages for scheduled or unscheduled
    maintenance.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose
    licensing and safety requirements for nuclear generation
    facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the
    authority to impose fines, shut down a unit, or both, depending
    upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until
    compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated
    by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at
    nuclear plants such as UE’s. In addition, if a serious
    nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material but
    indeterminable adverse effect on UE’s results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity. A major incident
    at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC
    to limit or prohibit the operation or relicensing of any
    domestic nuclear unit.

UE’s Callaway nuclear plant’s next scheduled refueling
    and maintenance outage is in 2007. During an outage, which
    occurs approximately every 18 months, maintenance and
    purchased power costs increase, and the amount of excess power
    available for sale decreases, compared with non-outage years.

Operating performance at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant has
    resulted in unscheduled or extended outages. The operating
    performance at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant has declined
    both in comparison with its past operating performance and in
    comparison with the operating performance of other nuclear
    plants in the United States. Ameren and UE are actively working
    to address the factors that led to the decline in
    Callaway’s operating performance. Management and
    supervision of operating personnel, equipment reliability,
    maintenance worker practices, engineering performance, training,
    and overall organizational effectiveness have been reviewed.
    Some actions have been taken and other actions are under
    consideration. However, Ameren and UE cannot predict whether
    such efforts will result in an overall improvement of operations
    at Callaway. Any actions taken are expected to result in
    incremental operating costs at Callaway. Further, additional
    unscheduled or extended outages at Callaway could have a
    material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity of Ameren and UE.

Our energy risk management strategies may not be effective in
    managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result
    in unanticipated liabilities or increased volatility in our
    earnings.

We are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas,
    fuel, electricity, emission allowances, and transmission
    congestion. Prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity, and
    emission allowances may fluctuate substantially over relatively
    short periods of time and expose us to commodity price risk. We
    use long-term purchase and sales contracts in



addition to derivatives such as forward contracts, futures
    contracts, options, and swaps to manage these risks. We attempt
    to manage our risk associated with these activities through
    enforcement of established risk limits and risk management
    procedures. We cannot ensure that these strategies will be
    successful in managing our pricing risk, or that they will not
    result in net liabilities because of future volatility in these
    markets.

Although we routinely enter into contracts to hedge our exposure
    to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes
    in commodity prices, we do not hedge the entire exposure of our
    operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, our
    ability to hedge our exposure to commodity price volatility
    depends on liquid commodity markets. To the extent that
    commodity markets are illiquid, we may not be able to execute
    our risk management strategies, which could result in greater
    unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time. To the
    extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity
    prices can adversely affect our results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity.

Our facilities are considered critical energy infrastructure
    and may therefore be targets of acts of terrorism.

Like other electric and gas utilities, our power generation
    plants, fuel storage facilities, and transmission and
    distribution facilities may be targets of terrorist activities
    that could result in disruption of our ability to produce or
    distribute some portion of our energy products. Any such
    disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues or
    significant additional costs for repair, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity.

Our businesses are dependent on our ability to access the
    capital markets successfully. We may not have access to
    sufficient capital in the amounts and at the times needed.

We use short-term and long-term capital markets as a significant
    source of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not
    satisfied by our operating cash flow, including those related to
    future environmental compliance. The inability to raise capital
    on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in
    the capital markets, could negatively affect our ability to
    maintain and to expand our businesses. Our current credit
    ratings cause us to believe that we will continue to have access
    to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control may
    create uncertainty that could increase our cost of capital or
    impair our ability to access the capital markets. See the Credit
    Ratings section in Liquidity and Capital Resources in
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of
    this report for a discussion of credit rating changes in
    response to actions in Illinois with respect to the matter of
    power procurement commencing in 2007.

“Net Kilowatt Capability”
    is the generating capacity available for dispatch from the
    facility into the electric transmission grid.

(b)

This facility is out of service. It
    is not operational because of a breach of its upper reservoir in
    December 2005. Its 2005 peak summer electrical demand net
    kilowatt capability was 440,000. See a discussion of this
    incident and related matters below.



In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at
    UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility.
    Should the decision be made to rebuild the Taum Sauk plant, UE
    would expect it to be out of service through at least the middle
    of 2009, if not longer. For additional information on the Taum
    Sauk incident, see Note 14 – Commitments and
    Contingencies under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Our other properties include distribution lines, underground

With only a few exceptions, we have fee title to all principal
    plants and other units of property material to the operation of
    our businesses, and to the real property on which such
    facilities are located (subject to mortgage liens securing our
    outstanding first mortgage bond and credit facility indebtedness
    and to certain permitted liens and judgment liens). The
    exceptions are as follows:

•

A portion of UE’s Osage plant reservoir, certain facilities
    at UE’s Sioux plant, most of UE’s Peno Creek and
    Audrain CT facilities, Genco’s Columbia CT facility,
    AERG’s Indian Trails generating facility, Medina
    Valley’s generating facility, certain of Ameren’s
    substations, and most of our transmission and distribution lines
    and gas mains are situated on lands we occupy under leases,
    easements, franchises, licenses or permits.

•

The United States or the state of Missouri may own or may have
    paramount rights to certain lands lying in the bed of the Osage
    River or located between the inner and outer harbor lines of the
    Mississippi River, on which certain of UE’s generating and
    other properties are located.

•

The United States, the state of Illinois, the state of Iowa, or
    the city of Keokuk, Iowa, may own or may have paramount rights
    with respect to certain lands lying in the bed of the
    Mississippi River on which a portion of UE’s Keokuk plant
    is located.

Substantially all of the properties and plant of UE, CIPS, CILCO
    and IP are subject to the direct first liens of the indentures
    securing their mortgage bonds. In October 2003, CILCO
    transferred substantially all of its generating property and
    plant to its

non-rate-regulated

electric generating subsidiary, AERG. In December 2006, CILCO
    transferred the remainder of its generating property and plant
    to AERG. As part of these transfers, CILCO’s transferred
    generating property and plant was released from the lien of the
    indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. In May 2005, UE
    transferred substantially all of its Illinois electric and gas
    transmission and distribution properties to CIPS. As a part of
    the transfer, UE’s transferred utility properties were
    released from the lien of the indenture securing its first
    mortgage bonds and immediately became subject to the lien of the
    indenture securing CIPS’ first mortgage bonds. In July 2006
    and February 2007, AERG recorded open-ended mortgages and
    security agreements with respect to its E.D. Edwards and Duck
    Creek power plants to serve as collateral to secure its
    obligations under multiyear, senior secured credit facilities
    entered into on July 14, 2006 and February 9, 2007,
    along with other Ameren subsidiaries. See
    Note 5 –



Credit Facilities and Liquidity for details of the credit
    facilities.

In December 2002, UE conveyed most of its Peno Creek CT facility
    to the city of Bowling Green, Missouri, and leased the facility
    back from the city for a

20-year

term. As a part of the transaction, most of UE’s Peno Creek
    CT property and plant was released from the lien of the
    indenture securing UE’s first mortgage bonds. Under the
    terms of this capital lease, UE retains all operation and
    maintenance responsibilities for the facility. Ownership of the
    facility will return to UE at the expiration of the lease. When
    ownership of the Peno Creek CT facility is returned to UE by
    Bowling Green, the property and plant may again become subject
    to the lien of any outstanding UE first mortgage bond indenture.

In March 2006, UE purchased a CT facility located in Audrain
    County, Missouri, from NRG Audrain Holding, LLC, and NRG
    Audrain Generating LLC, affiliates of NRG Energy, Inc.
    (collectively, NRG). As a part of this transaction, UE was
    assigned the rights of NRG as lessee of the CT facility under a
    long-term lease with Audrain County and assumed NRG’s
    obligations under the lease. The lease term will expire
    December 1, 2023. Under the terms of this capital lease, UE
    has all operation and maintenance responsibilities for the
    facility, and ownership of the facility will be transferred to
    UE at the expiration of the lease. When ownership of the Audrain
    County CT facility is transferred to UE by the county, the
    property and plant will become subject to the lien of any
    outstanding UE first mortgage bond indenture.

For additional information on these CT lease arrangements, see
    Note 2 – Acquisitions under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report.

ITEM 3. LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS.

We are involved in legal and administrative proceedings before
    various courts and agencies with respect to matters that arise
    in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve
    substantial amounts of money. We believe that the final
    disposition of these proceedings, except as otherwise disclosed
    in this report, will not have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Risk of
    loss is mitigated, in some cases, by insurance or contractual or
    statutory indemnification. We believe that we have established
    appropriate reserves for potential losses.

In April 2005, Caterpillar Inc. intervened in the ICC
    proceedings relating to the power procurement auction and
    related tariffs of CILCO, CIPS and IP. In the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ 2005 auction process proceedings, Caterpillar
    Inc., in conjunction with other industrial customers as a
    coalition, opposed the Ameren Illinois Utilities’ filing on
    issues regarding auction design and auction process, among
    others. In February 2006, Caterpillar Inc. intervened in the
    2006 rate cases filed by the Ameren Illinois Utilities with the
    ICC to modify their electric delivery service rates. In the 2006
    rate cases, Caterpillar Inc., in conjunction with other
    industrial customers as a coalition, opposed the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ filings on issues regarding rate design and
    revenue requirements, among others. Douglas R. Oberhelman
    is an executive officer of Caterpillar Inc. and a member of the
    board of directors of Ameren. Mr. Oberhelman did not
    participate in Ameren Corporation’s board and committee
    deliberations relating to these matters.

Anheuser-Busch, Incorporated, an affiliate of Anheuser-Busch
    Companies, Inc., and The Boeing Company are members of the
    Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers group (MIEC) which, on
    September 1, 2006, intervened in the MoPSC proceedings
    relating to UE’s request for an increase in base rates for
    electric service. MIEC’s position in the case is that UE
    overstated its needed revenue requirement and that a
    disproportionate amount of the increase has been assigned to
    industrial customers. MIEC also opposes UE’s requested fuel
    and purchased power cost recovery mechanism. Patrick T.
    Stokes is the chairman of the board of directors of
    Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. and James C. Johnson is an
    officer of The Boeing Company. Mr. Stokes and
    Mr. Johnson are also members of the board of directors of
    Ameren. Neither Mr. Stokes nor Mr. Johnson
    participated in Ameren Corporation’s board and committee
    deliberations relating to these matters.

For additional information on legal and administrative
    proceedings, see Rates and Regulation under Item 1,
    Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, above. See also
    Liquidity and Capital Resources and Regulatory Matters in
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and

    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report.

ITEM 4.
    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders
    during the fourth quarter of 2006 with respect to any of the
    Ameren Companies.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

Ameren Executive
    Summary

Operations

Clearly, 2006 will be remembered as an incredibly challenging
    year for Ameren, as well as for the communities served by UE,
    CIPS, CILCO and IP. For the better part of the second half of
    2006, Ameren was focused on addressing the consequences
    resulting from unprecedented summer and winter storms. In 2006,
    UE also continued its extensive restoration efforts associated
    with the December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at its Taum
    Sauk pumped-storage, hydroelectric facility and settled related
    liability matters with federal authorities. Unfortunately, UE
    did not receive a unified settlement offer from all relevant
    Missouri state authorities. On February 2, 2007, UE
    submitted plans and an environmental report to the FERC to
    rebuild the upper reservoir of the Taum Sauk plant assuming
    successful resolution of outstanding issues with authorities of
    the state of Missouri.

Because of the likelihood of higher electric rates in Illinois
    following the end of a legislative rate freeze on
    January 2, 2007, certain Illinois legislators, the Illinois
    attorney general, the Illinois governor, and other parties
    sought to block an ICC-approved auction that occurred in
    September 2006 to procure power for use by the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ customers beginning in 2007. These parties
    continue to challenge the auction process and the recovery of
    costs for power supply resulting from the auction through rates
    to customers. To mitigate the impact of the electric rate
    increases on customers, an electric rate increase phase-in plan
    was approved by the ICC in December 2006. In November, the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities also received an ICC order increasing
    their electric delivery service rates by an aggregate of
    $97 million. This order authorized a 10% return on equity,
    but was significantly less than the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ request for approximately a $200 million
    increase primarily because of the disallowance of significant
    levels of expenses, which the Ameren Illinois Utilities believe
    were prudently incurred. Primarily as a result of this order and
    cost increases since the 2004 base year for setting these rates,
    the return on equity in 2007 for the Ameren Illinois Utilities
    will be meaningfully below the 10% return on equity allowed by
    the order. A rehearing was granted on a portion of the
    disallowed costs. The necessity and timing of additional
    electric delivery services rate increase requests in Illinois
    will be influenced by the result of this rehearing, which is
    expected in May 2007. In July 2006, UE filed for its first
    electric rate increase in almost 20 years. UE’s
    electric rate filing included a proposed annual increase in
    electric rates of $361 million. UE also filed last July for
    an increase in natural gas delivery rates of $11 million
    annually. Interveners in the electric rate case have recommended
    rate reductions. Decisions are expected by the MoPSC by June
    2007.

While 2006 was full of challenges, we did remain focused on our
    core operations and were able to achieve several notable
    accomplishments. From an operational standpoint, Ameren’s
    power plants performed very well in 2006, setting records for
    generation output. Availability and capacity factors of the
    Missouri Regulated coal-fired power plants were comparable with
    solid 2005 results, averaging 90% and 82%, respectively. In
    2006, Ameren’s non-rate-regulated coal-fired plants
    improved their availability from 82% to 85% year over year and
    capacity factors from 68% to 73%. We also successfully executed
    our plan to hedge most of our estimated available 2007
    non-rate-regulated



generation due to the expiration of our below-market contracts
    at the end of 2006.

Earnings

Ameren reported earnings of $2.66 per share for 2006 which
    compared to earnings of $3.02 per share last year.
    Ameren’s earnings in 2005 included an 11 cent per
    share charge for the adoption of a new accounting principle
    related to AROs. Earnings in 2006 were affected by restoration
    efforts associated with severe storms that reduced Ameren’s
    net income by 26 cents per share. In addition, costs related to
    the December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at UE’s
    Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility decreased 2006
    earnings by 20 cents per share. Ameren also incurred a charge of
    5 cents per share related to funding commitments for low-income
    energy assistance and energy-efficiency programs associated with
    the December 2006 ICC order associated with the electric rate
    increase phase-in plan. Incremental gains of approximately
    9 cents per share in 2006, associated with the sale of
    certain

non-core

properties, including leveraged leases, reduced the negative
    impact of these items.

Earnings in 2006 were also unfavorably affected by escalating
    costs for fuel and related transportation, operating materials,
    and financing costs and depreciation associated with significant
    energy infrastructure investments in Ameren’s regulated
    electric and gas utility businesses. In addition, earnings were
    significantly affected by mild summer and winter weather, as
    well as lower power prices for excess energy sales as compared
    to 2005. Market prices for power in 2005 were higher than 2006
    as a result of the significant impact of hurricanes and rail
    disruptions in 2005. Operating results in 2006 benefited from
    organic sales growth; improved plant performance; the lack of a
    scheduled refueling and maintenance outage at UE’s Callaway
    nuclear plant; Illinois electric commercial and industrial
    customers returning to tariff rates because these rates were
    below market rates for power; and higher sales levels of
    emission allowances.

Liquidity

Cash flows from operations of $1.3 billion in 2006 at
    Ameren, along with other funds, were used to pay dividends to
    common shareholders of $522 million and fund capital
    expenditures of $992 million and CT acquisitions of
    $292 million. Financing activities in 2006 primarily
    consisted of refinancing debt and funding capital investment
    with borrowings under credit facilities.

Outlook

Electric rates in Illinois are expected to continue to be a
    source of debate among legislators and regulators in 2007.
    Proposed actions have included freezing rates at 2006 levels
    despite significantly higher purchased power costs for the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities. Any decision or action that impairs
    the ability of CIPS, CILCO and IP to fully recover costs from
    their electric customers in a timely manner would result in
    material adverse consequences for Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO,
    and IP. CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP expect to take whatever
    actions are necessary to protect their financial interests,
    including seeking the protection of the bankruptcy courts.

The ultimate resolution of pending electric and gas rate cases
    in Missouri, coupled with a final decision in the rehearing of
    certain electric delivery service rate case issues in Illinois,
    will have a significant impact on earnings in 2007 and 2008.
    Ameren’s regulated utilities are expected to experience
    significant increases in the costs of serving their customers,
    including coal and related transportation costs that are
    expected to increase by 15% to 20% in 2007 and another 5% to 10%
    in 2008. Many of these costs will be in excess of those
    reflected in 2007 regulated rates because rates are largely
    based on historical costs. Ameren expects to realize
    significantly higher electric margins due to the replacement of
    below-market power sales contracts, which expired in 2006, with
    higher-priced contracts in 2007. In the future, Ameren also
    expects to realize lower income associated with the sale of
    emission allowances and noncore properties than realized in
    2006. While Ameren expects continued economic growth in its
    service territory to benefit energy demand in 2007 and beyond,
    higher energy prices could result in reduced demand from
    consumers.

The EPA, together with state authorities, is requiring more
    stringent emission limits on all coal-fired power plants.
    Between 2007 and 2016, Ameren expects its subsidiaries will be
    required to spend between $3.5 billion and
    $4.5 billion to retrofit their power plants with pollution
    control equipment. Approximately half of this investment will be
    at UE and therefore is expected to be recoverable over time from
    ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts invested in
    non-rate-regulated operations will depend on whether market
    prices for power adjust to reflect this increased investment by
    the industry.

General

Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public
    utility holding company under PUHCA 2005 administered by FERC.
    Ameren was registered with the SEC as a public utility holding
    company under PUHCA 1935 until that act was repealed effective
    February 8, 2006. Ameren’s primary assets are the

The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a
    consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its
    majority-owned subsidiaries. As the acquisition of IP occurred
    on September 30, 2004, Ameren’s Consolidated
    Statements of Income and Cash Flows for the periods before
    September 30, 2004, do not reflect IP’s results of
    operations or financial position. See Note 2 –
    Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for further information on the
    accounting for the IP acquisition. All significant intercompany
    transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts
    are expressed in millions, unless otherwise indicated.

In addition to presenting results of operations and earnings
    amounts in total, we present certain information in cents per
    share. These amounts reflect factors that directly affect
    Ameren’s earnings. We believe this per share information
    helps readers to understand the impact of these factors on
    Ameren’s earnings per share. All references in this report
    to earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares
    outstanding during the applicable year.

RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Earnings
    Summary

Our results of operations and financial position are affected by
    many factors. Weather, economic conditions, and the actions of
    key customers or competitors can significantly affect the demand
    for our services. Our results are also affected by seasonal
    fluctuations: winter heating and summer cooling demands. About
    90% of Ameren’s revenues were directly subject to state or
    federal regulation in 2006. This regulation can have a material
    impact on the prices we charge for our services. Our
    non-rate-regulated sales are subject to market conditions for
    power. We principally use coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, and
    oil in our operations. The prices for these commodities can
    fluctuate significantly due to the global economic and political
    environment, weather, supply and demand, and many other factors.
    We do not currently have fuel or purchased power cost recovery
    mechanisms in Missouri for our electric utility businesses. We
    do have natural gas cost recovery mechanisms in Missouri and
    Illinois for our gas delivery businesses. See
    Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8 for a
    discussion of pending rate cases and the Illinois power
    procurement auction process and related tariffs. Fluctuations in
    interest rates affect our cost of borrowing and our pension and
    postretirement benefits costs. We employ various risk management
    strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risks and other
    risks inherent in our business. The reliability of our power
    plants and transmission and distribution systems, the level of
    purchased power costs, operating and administrative costs, and
    capital investment are key factors that we seek to control to
    optimize our results of operations, financial position, and
    liquidity.

Ameren’s net income was $547 million ($2.66 per
    share) for 2006, $606 million ($3.02 per share) for
    2005, and $530 million ($2.84 per share) for 2004. In
    2005, Ameren’s net income included a net cumulative effect
    aftertax loss of $22 million (11 cents per share)
    associated with recording liabilities for conditional AROs as a
    result of our adoption of FIN 47, “Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.” The net
    cumulative effect aftertax loss of adopting FIN 47 is
    presented below for the applicable registrant companies:

Ameren’s income before cumulative effect of the adoption of
    FIN 47 decreased $81 million and earnings per share
    decreased 47 cents in 2006 compared with 2005.

Earnings were negatively impacted in 2006 by:

•

costs and lost electric margins associated with outages caused
    by severe storms (26 cents per share);

•

milder weather conditions (estimated at 17 cents per share);

•

costs associated with the upper reservoir breach in December
    2005 at UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric plant
    (20 cents per share);

•

an unscheduled outage at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant (7
    cents per share);

•

higher depreciation expense (11 cents per share);

•

increased taxes other than income taxes (8 cents per share);

•

contributions made in association with the Illinois Customer
    Elect electric rate increase phase-in plan (5 cents per share);

•

increased fuel and purchased power costs; and

•

higher financing costs.

An increase in the number of common shares outstanding also
    reduced Ameren’s earnings per share in 2006 compared with
    2005.



Earnings were favorably impacted in 2006 by:

•

Higher margins on interchange sales (33 cents per share);

•

increased net gains on the sale of noncore properties, including
    leveraged leases, compared with 2005 (9 cents per share);

•

the lack of a refueling and maintenance outage at UE’s
    Callaway nuclear plant in 2006 (18 cents per share);

•

increased sales of emission allowances (5 cents per share); and

•

other factors including improved plant operations, lack of coal
    conservation efforts, industrial electric customers switching
    back to the Ameren Illinois Utilities, lower bad debt expenses
    and organic growth.

Cents per share information presented above is based on average
    shares outstanding in 2005.

Ameren’s net income before cumulative effect of the
    adoption of FIN 47 in 2005 increased $98 million and
    earnings per share increased 29 cents in 2005 compared with 2004.

Earnings were favorably impacted in 2005 by:

•

warmer weather in the summer of 2005 compared with extremely
    mild conditions in the summer of 2004 (estimated at 26 cents per
    share);

•

inclusion of IP results for an additional nine months in 2005
    (23 cents per share);

•

increased margins on interchange sales (11 cents per share);

•

the lower cost of the refueling and maintenance outage at
    UE’s Callaway nuclear plant in 2005 versus the 2004
    refueling and maintenance outage (3 cents per share);

•

increased emission allowance sales earnings (2 cents per
    share);

•

net gains on sales of noncore properties, including leveraged
    leases in 2005 (7 cents per share);

•

lower employee benefit costs (5 cents per share); and

•

other factors including organic growth.

Earnings were negatively impacted in 2005 by:

•

incremental costs of operating in the MISO Day Two Energy Market
    (29 cents per share);

•

the lack of a FERC-ordered refund of $18 million in exit
    fees as had occurred in 2004 – this fee had previously
    been paid by UE and CIPS to the MISO, upon their re-entry into
    the MISO (6 cents per share);

•

increased labor costs (8 cents per share); and

•

other factors including increased fuel and purchased power costs
    and coal conservation efforts in 2005.

An increase in the number of common shares outstanding also
    reduced Ameren’s earnings per share in 2005 compared with
    2004.

Cents per share information presented above is based on average
    shares outstanding in 2004.

Because it is a holding company, Ameren’s net income and
    cash flows are primarily generated by its principal
    subsidiaries: UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP. The following
    table presents the contribution by Ameren’s principal
    subsidiaries to Ameren’s consolidated net income for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004:

Before the third quarter of 2006, Ameren reported one segment,
    Utility Operations, comprising electric generation and electric
    and gas transmission and distribution operations. Ameren holding
    company activity was listed in the caption called Other. As a
    result of the following changes in circumstances, Ameren, UE,
    CILCORP and CILCO changed their segments in the third quarter of
    2006:

•

the Ameren Companies’ chief operating decision-making group
    began to assess the performance and allocate resources based on
    a new segment structure and made related organizational and
    management reporting changes in the third and fourth quarters of
    2006;

•

electric generation deregulation in Illinois, which became
    effective on January 1, 2007;

•

the expiration of affiliate power supply agreements for CIPS and
    CILCO, and other supply agreements for IP on December 31,
    2006;

•

the July 2006 termination of the JDA among UE, Genco and CIPS
    effective December 31, 2006; and

•

the September 2006 completion of a statewide auction to procure
    power for CIPS, CILCO and IP for 2007 and beyond, and Marketing
    Company’s sale in that auction of power being acquired from
    Genco and AERG.

In the third quarter of 2006, Ameren determined that it has
    three reportable segments: Missouri Regulated, Illinois
    Regulated and Non-rate-regulated Generation. UE determined that
    it has one reportable segment: Missouri Regulated. CILCORP and
    CILCO determined that they have two reportable segments:
    Illinois Regulated and Non-rate-regulated Generation. A
    discussion of changes in components of net income between
    periods by business segment is provided below where material.
    Prior-period



presentation has been adjusted for comparative purposes. See
    Note 17 – Segment Information to our financial
    statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for
    further discussion of Ameren’s, UE’s, CILCORP’s
    and CILCO’s business segments.

Ameren acquired IP on
    September 30, 2004. Therefore, 2004 included IP results for
    just three months. See discussion below in each respective
    section for the effect of the additional nine months of IP
    results in 2005.



Margins

The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable)
    variations in the registrants’ electric and gas margins
    from the previous year. Electric margins are defined as electric
    revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. Gas margins are
    defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale. The table
    covers the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. We
    consider electric, interchange and gas margins useful measures
    to analyze the change in profitability of our electric and gas
    operations between periods. We have included the analysis below
    as a complement to the financial information we provide in
    accordance with GAAP. However, these margins may not be a
    presentation defined under GAAP, and they may not be comparable
    to other companies’ presentations or more useful than the
    GAAP information we provide elsewhere in this report.

The variations in electric and gas margins for Ameren show the
    contribution from IP for the first nine months of 2005 as a
    separate line item, which allows an easier comparison with other
    margin components. The variation in IP electric margin in 2005
    is compared with the full year of 2004, despite Ameren’s
    acquisition of IP occurring on September 30, 2004.

2006 versus 2005

Ameren

Ameren’s electric margin increased by $41 million, or
    1%, in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to an
    increase in Ameren’s electric margin were as follows:

•

A $162 million, or 67%, increase in margins on interchange
    sales. The expiration of EEI’s affiliate cost-based power
    supply contract on December 31, 2005, the expiration of
    several large Marketing Company power supply contracts in 2006,
    and an increase in plant availability provided Ameren with
    additional power to sell in the spot market. The increase in
    margins on interchange sales from these items was reduced by
    lower power prices, resulting from declining market prices for
    natural gas, the significant impact of hurricanes and rail
    disruptions on prices in 2005.

•

Plant efficiencies, primarily at CILCO (AERG), as Ameren’s
    baseload electric generating plants’ average capacity and
    equivalent availability factors were approximately 80% and 88%,
    respectively, in 2006 compared with 76% and 86%, respectively,
    in 2005.

•

The lack of a UE Callaway nuclear plant refueling and
    maintenance outage in 2006, which resulted in an increased
    electric margin of $25 million.

•

Upgrades performed during the refueling and maintenance outage
    in 2005, which increased Callaway’s output and electric
    margin by $22 million.

•

Organic growth and industrial customers who switched back to
    below-market Illinois tariff rates because of the expiration of
    power contracts with suppliers.

•

Lower purchased power costs at IP.

•

Sales to Noranda, which began receiving power on June 1,
    2005, resulting in increased electric margin of $20 million
    at UE.

•

Increased sales of emission allowances, totaling
    $14 million, and lower emission allowance costs, totaling
    $5 million, in 2006 compared with 2005.

Factors contributing to a decrease in Ameren’s electric
    margin were as follows:

•

Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 9% decline in
    cooling

degree-days,

that reduced the electric margin by $33 million in 2006
    compared with 2005.

•

Severe storm-related outages in 2006 that reduced overall
    electric margin by $9 million as less electricity was sold
    for native load, partially offset by an increase in margins on
    the sales of this power on the interchange market.

•

An increase in fuel and purchased power costs for native load at
    UE and Genco due to the expiration of a cost-based power supply
    contract with EEI.

•

A 12% increase in coal and transportation prices.

•

A $25 million reduction in margins because of the
    unavailability of UE’s Taum Sauk hydroelectric plant in
    2006 compared with 2005.

•

An $11 million reduction in native load margins from
    UE’s other hydroelectric generation in 2006 compared with
    2005.

•

An unscheduled outage in 2006 at UE’s Callaway nuclear
    plant, which reduced electric margins by an estimated
    $20 million.

•

Reduced transmission service revenues, primarily due to the
    elimination of interim cost recovery mechanisms and reduced
    revenues associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market.

Ameren’s gas margin decreased by $24 million, or 6%,
    in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily because of the following
    factors:

•

Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 9% decrease in
    heating

degree-days,

which reduced the gas margin by $15 million in 2006 from
    2005. Weather-sensitive residential and commercial gas sales
    volumes decreased by 8% each, in 2006 compared with 2005.

•

Unrecoverable purchased gas costs, together with unfavorable
    customer sales mix totaling $19 million.

Factors contributing to an increase in Ameren’s gas margin
    were as follows:

•

An IP rate increase that became effective in May 2005, which
    added revenues of $6 million in 2006.

•

Increased sales to customers, excluding the impact from weather,
    of 2%, or $4 million.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

UE’s total electric margin increased by $21 million in
    2006 from 2005. UE’s Missouri Regulated electric margin
    increased by $9 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors
    contributing to an increase in UE’s electric margin were as
    follows:

•

Sales to Noranda that increased electric margin by
    $20 million and other organic growth.

•

Increased sales of emission allowances, totaling
    $30 million.

•

The lack of a scheduled Callaway nuclear plant refueling and
    maintenance outage in 2006.

•

Capacity upgrades at the Callaway plant during the refueling and
    maintenance outage in 2005.

UE’s other electric margin increased by $12 million as
    a result of the adoption of Staff Accounting Bulletin 108.
    See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies, Accounting Changes and Other Matters, to our financial
    statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for
    further information.

Factors that contributed to a decrease in UE’s electric
    margin were as follows:

•

Unfavorable weather conditions that reduced electric margin by
    $11 million, as evidenced by an 8% decline in cooling

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005.

•

Severe storm-related outages in 2006 that reduced electric
    native load sales and resulted in an estimated net reduction in
    overall electric margin of $6 million.

•

Lower margins on nonaffiliate interchange sales in 2006 compared
    with 2005, which resulted from reduced



power prices. The average realized power prices on UE’s
    interchange sales decreased from $48 per megawatthour in
    2005 to $37 per megawatthour in 2006. However, margins on
    interchange sales benefited from the January 10, 2006,
    amendment of the JDA. The MoPSC-required and FERC-approved
    change in the JDA methodology (to basing the allocation of
    third-party short-term power sales of excess generation on
    generation output instead of load requirements) resulted in
    $23 million in incremental margins on interchange sales for
    UE in 2006 compared with 2005.

•

The transfer of UE’s Illinois service territory in May 2005
    to CIPS, which decreased electric margin by an estimated
    $22 million in 2006 compared with 2005.

•

A 9% increase in coal and related transportation prices.

•

Fees of $4 million levied by FERC in 2006 for prior
    years’ generation benefits provided to UE’s Osage
    hydroelectric plant.

•

Reduced electric margin because of the unavailability of
    UE’s Taum Sauk hydroelectric plant.

•

Reduced electric margin from UE’s other hydroelectric
    generation, due to drought-like conditions across the central
    and southern portions of Missouri.

•

outage at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant in the second quarter
    of 2006 that reduced electric margin (maintenance expenses were
    covered under warranty).

•

MISO Day Two Energy Market costs, which were $6 million
    higher in 2006, as this market did not begin operating until the
    second quarter of 2005.

•

The expiration of a cost-based power supply contract with EEI on
    December 31, 2005.

•

Reduced transmission service revenues of $13 million,
    primarily due to elimination of interim cost recovery mechanisms
    and reduced revenues associated with the MISO Day Two Energy
    Market.

UE’s gas margin decreased by $13 million, or 18%, in
    2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to the decreased
    margins were as follows:

•

Mild winter weather conditions that reduced gas margins by
    $2 million, as evidenced by an 8% decrease in heating

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005.

•

The transfer of UE’s Illinois service territory in May 2005
    to CIPS, which reduced gas margin by $4 million.

•

A reduction in gas sales to customers, excluding the impacts
    from weather.

•

Unrecoverable purchased gas costs totaling $4 million.

Illinois
    Regulated

Illinois Regulated’s electric margin decreased by
    $5 million, or 1%, and gas margin decreased by
    $8 million, or 3%, in 2006 compared with 2005. See below
    for explanations of electric and gas margin variances for the
    Illinois Regulated segment.

CIPS

CIPS’ electric margin increased by $3 million, or 1%,
    in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to an increase
    in CIPS’ electric margin were as follows:

•

The transfer to CIPS of UE’s Illinois service territory in
    May 2005, which increased electric margin by $7 million.

•

Primarily industrial customers, switching back to CIPS from
    Marketing Company in 2006 because tariff rates were below market
    rates for power.

•

Decrease in MISO Day Two Energy Market costs of $7 million.

•

Increased miscellaneous revenues of $2 million.

Factors contributing to a decrease in CIPS’ electric margin
    were as follows:

•

Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 9% decrease in
    cooling

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005 that reduced electric margins by
    $7 million.

•

Severe storm-related outages in 2006 that reduced electric sales
    and reduced the electric margin by $3 million.

•

Reduced transmission service revenues, primarily due to
    elimination of interim cost recovery mechanisms, and reduced
    revenues associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market.

Due to the expiration of CIPS’ cost-based power supply
    agreement with EEI in December 2005, pursuant to which CIPS sold
    its entitlements under the agreement to Marketing Company, both
    interchange revenues and purchased power expenses decreased by
    $34 million in 2006 compared with 2005.

CIPS’ gas margin increased by $1 million, or 1%, in
    2006, compared with 2005, primarily because the transfer to CIPS
    of UE’s Illinois service territory in May 2005 added
    $4 million to gas margin. CIPS’ increase in gas margin
    was reduced by mild winter weather, as evidenced by a 10%
    decrease in heating

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005, which reduced the gas margin by
    $3 million.

CILCO (Illinois

See Non-rate-regulated Generation under Results of Operations
    for a detailed explanation of CILCO’s (AERG) change in
    electric margin in 2006 compared with 2005.

CILCO’s Illinois Regulated electric margin increased by
    $7 million, or 5%, in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors



contributing to an increase in CILCO’s Illinois Regulated
    electric margin were as follows:

•

Increased native load growth, primarily in the industrial sector.

•

Increased miscellaneous revenues totaling $2 million.

•

A decrease in MISO Day Two Energy Market costs totaling
    $2 million.

Factors contributing to a decrease in CILCO’s Illinois
    Regulated electric margin were as follows:

•

Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by an 18% decrease
    in cooling

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005, that reduced electric margins by
    $7 million.

•

Reduced transmission service revenues, primarily due to
    elimination of interim cost recovery mechanisms and reduced
    revenues associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market.

CILCO’s (Illinois Regulated) gas margin decreased by
    $10 million, or 10%, in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors
    contributing to a decrease in CILCO’s gas margin were as
    follows:

•

Mild winter weather conditions in CILCO’s service
    territory, as evidenced by a 7% decrease in heating

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005, that reduced gas margin by
    $3 million.

•

Lower transportation volumes, together with unfavorable customer
    sales mix.

IP

IP’s electric margin decreased by $15 million, or 4%,
    in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to a decrease
    in IP’s electric margin were as follows:

•

Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 10% decrease
    in cooling

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005, that reduced electric margins by
    $9 million.

•

Severe storm-related outages in 2006 that resulted in reduced
    electric sales, decreasing electric margin by $2 million.

•

Reduced transmission service revenues of $17 million,
    primarily due to the elimination of interim cost recovery
    mechanisms and reduced revenues associated with the MISO Day Two
    Energy Market.

Factors contributing to an increase in IP’s electric margin
    were as follows:

•

A net increase in electric margin as a result of primarily
    industrial customers switching back to IP because tariff rates
    were below market rates for power. The increase in revenues more
    than offset an increase in purchased power costs.

•

Lower transmission expenses included in purchased power costs
    due, in part, to a $6 million favorable settlement of
    disputed ancillary charges with MISO.

•

Lower MISO Day Two Energy Market costs totaling $4 million.

•

Increased rental and miscellaneous revenues totaling
    $5 million.

IP’s gas margin increased by $1 million, or 1%, in
    2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to an increase in
    IP’s gas margin were as follows:

•

A rate increase effective in May 2005 that added revenues of
    $6 million in 2006.

•

Organic growth, primarily in the industrial sector.

The increase in gas margin was reduced by mild winter weather
    conditions, as evidenced by a 9% decrease in heating

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005, that reduced gas margin by
    $7 million.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Non-rate-regulated Generation’s electric margin increased
    by $53 million, or 8%, in 2006 compared with 2005. See
    below for explanations of electric margin variances for the
    Non-rate-regulated Generation segment.

Genco

Genco’s electric margin decreased by $103 million, or
    22%, in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to a
    decrease in Genco’s electric margin were as follows:

•

Lower wholesale margins as Genco purchased additional power at
    higher costs to supply Marketing Company after the expiration of
    the cost-based power supply contract between EEI and its
    affiliates on December 31, 2005.

•

Higher net emission allowance costs because of a
    $21 million gain at Genco in the third quarter of 2005,
    which resulted from the nonmonetary swap of certain earlier
    vintage-year
    SO


emission allowances for later vintage-year allowances.

•

A 9% increase in coal and transportation prices.

•

Lower margins on interchange sales in 2006 compared with 2005,
    primarily because of lower power prices, and a $23 million
    reduction in 2006 due to the amendment of the JDA among UE,
    Genco and CIPS. The average realized power prices on
    Genco’s interchange sales decreased from $47 per
    megawatt in 2005 to $38 per megawatt hour in 2006.

•

Higher MISO Day Two Energy Market costs totaling
    $12 million in 2006 compared with 2005, since the market
    did not begin operating until the second quarter of 2005.

Genco’s decrease in electric margin was reduced by
    increased sales to CIPS as a result of the May 2005 transfer of
    UE’s Illinois service territory to CIPS.

CILCO (AERG)

AERG’s electric margin increased by $22 million, or
    25%, in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to an
    increase in AERG’s electric margin were as follows:

•

Lower purchased power costs due to improved power plant
    availability.

•

A decrease in emission allowance utilization expenses of
    $9 million in 2006 compared with 2005.



•

An increase in margins on interchange sales due to improved
    plant availability. AERG’s electric generating plants’
    average capacity and equivalent availability factors were
    approximately 69% and 81%, respectively, in 2006 compared with
    61% and 73%, respectively, in 2005.

AERG’s electric margin was reduced by a 31% increase in
    coal and transportation prices in 2006 over 2005.

EEI

EEI’s electric margin increased by $194 million in
    2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to EEI’s
    increase in electric margin were as follows:

•

An increase in margins on interchange sales, which resulted from
    the expiration of its affiliate cost-based sales contract on
    December 31, 2005, and its replacement with an affiliate
    market-based sales contract.

•

Sales of emission allowances.

2005 versus 2004

Ameren

Ameren’s electric margin increased by $366 million in
    2005 compared with 2004. An additional nine months of IP results
    was included in 2005, which added $352 million of electric
    margin. Other factors contributing to an increase in
    Ameren’s electric margin were as follows:

•

An increase in margin on interchange sales of $66 million
    in 2005 compared with 2004, principally because of higher power
    prices and access to the MISO Day Two Energy Market. Average
    realized prices on Ameren’s interchange sales increased
    from $30 per megawatthour in 2004 to $44 per
    megawatthour in 2005. Higher market prices for natural gas,
    emission allowances, and coal in 2005 contributed to the higher
    power prices. Hurricanes and disruptions in coal delivery
    contributed to these higher prices. The MISO Day Two Energy
    Market also contributed to an increase in margins on interchange
    sales by an estimated $34 million in 2005 as compared to
    2004. With the inception of the MISO Day Two Energy Market in
    2005, all transmission losses, previously borne by the energy
    providers, were transferred to MISO, which effectively allowed
    the generation units to increase sales by approximately 1.8%.

•

Favorable weather conditions, as warmer summer weather in 2005
    compared with extremely mild conditions in the summer of 2004
    resulted in a 37% increase in cooling

degree-days

in 2005 in Ameren’s service territory. Excluding the
    additional nine months of IP sales in 2005, Ameren’s
    weather-sensitive residential and commercial sales were up 10%
    and 3%, respectively, in 2005 compared with 2004.

•

Sales to Noranda, which increased electric margin by
    $33 million. Effective June 1, 2005, UE began to
    supply approximately 470 megawatts (peak load) of electric
    service (or about 5% of UE’s generating capability,
    including committed purchases) to Noranda’s primary
    aluminum smelter in southeast Missouri under a

15-year

agreement.

•

Organic growth.

Factors contributing to a decrease in Ameren’s electric
    margin were as follows:

•

MISO costs that were $107 million higher in 2005 compared
    with 2004. MISO costs increased as a result of line losses,
    transmission congestion charges, and charges associated with
    volatile weather conditions and deviations of actual from
    forecasted plant availability and customer loads. Some of these
    higher costs were attributed to the relative infancy of the MISO
    Day Two Energy Market, suboptimal dispatching of plants, and
    price volatility.

•

Electric rate reductions resulting from the 2002 UE electric
    rate case settlement in Missouri that negatively affected
    electric revenues by $7 million during 2005. These were the
    final rate reductions under the 2002 rate case settlement.

•

An extended refueling and maintenance outage at UE’s
    Callaway nuclear plant in 2005.

•

Expiration and nonrenewal of low-margin, non-rate-regulated
    power sales contracts to customers outside our core service
    territory.

•

Coal conservation efforts that reduced interchange sales.

•

Unscheduled coal-fired plant outages during the peak summer
    period, which resulted in increased higher-cost CT generation
    used to serve the demand.

•

Increased utilization and

mark-to-market

losses on emission allowance put options of $50 million in
    2005. However, fuel and purchased power costs were reduced in
    2005 by a $21 million gain at Genco resulting from the
    nonmonetary swap of certain earlier vintage-year
    SO


emission allowances for later vintage-year emission allowances.

Ameren’s gas margin increased by $120 million in 2005
    compared with 2004, primarily because of the inclusion of an
    additional nine months of IP results in 2005. Excluding these IP
    results, gas margin increased $16 million, primarily due to
    UE’s rate increase, which became effective in the first
    quarter of 2005, and more favorable weather conditions in the
    fourth quarter of 2005 than in the same period in 2004.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

UE’s electric margin decreased by $22 million in 2005
    compared with 2004. Factors contributing to a decrease in
    UE’s electric margin were as follows:

•

The transfer of UE’s Illinois service territory to CIPS,
    which was completed in May 2005. This transfer resulted in an
    estimated decrease in electric margin of $74 million in
    2005.

•

Reduced electric rates in the first quarter of 2005 as compared
    to the first quarter of 2004.



•

Increased MISO Day Two Energy Market costs totaling
    $59 million in 2005 compared with 2004.

•

Coal conservation efforts that reduced excess plant production
    and interchange sales.

•

Increased CT generation using high-cost natural gas to serve
    increased summer demand.

•

A $12 million decrease in emission allowance transactions
    in 2005 compared with 2004.

Factors contributing to an increase in UE’s electric margin
    were as follows:

•

Sales to Noranda, which increased electric margin by
    $33 million.

•

An increase in margins on interchange sales. Margins on
    interchange sales with nonaffiliates increased $26 million
    in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily because of higher power
    prices and access to the MISO Day Two Energy Market. The MISO
    Day Two Energy Market resulted in an increase in margins on
    interchange sales by an estimated $23 million in 2005
    compared to 2004, as a result of reduced transmission losses.

•

Favorable weather conditions as evidenced by a 25% increase in
    cooling

degree-days

in 2005 compared with 2004.

UE’s gas margin increased by $10 million in 2005
    compared with 2004, because of the effect of a rate increase in
    the first quarter of 2005 and favorable weather. This increase
    was reduced by the May 2005 transfer of UE’s Illinois
    service territory to CIPS, which decreased the gas margin by
    $4 million.

Illinois
    Regulated

Illinois Regulated’s electric margin increased by
    $41 million, or 5%, in 2005 compared with 2004. Illinois
    Regulated’s gas margin increased by $5 million, or 2%,
    in 2005 compared with 2004. See below for explanations of the
    variances in electric and gas margins for the Illinois Regulated
    segment.

CIPS

CIPS’ electric margin increased by $41 million in 2005
    compared with 2004. Factors contributing to an increase in
    CIPS’ electric margin were as follows:

•

Increased native load sales as a result of the transfer to CIPS
    of UE’s Illinois service territory. The transfer of the
    Illinois service territory resulted in an estimated increase in
    electric margin of $27 million in 2005.

•

Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 44% increase in
    cooling

degree-days

in 2005 compared with 2004.

•

Customers who switched back to CIPS from Marketing Company
    because tariff rates were below market rates.

CIPS’ electric margin was reduced by a $23 million
    increase in MISO costs, included in purchased power, in 2005
    compared with 2004.

CIPS’ 2005 gas margin was comparable with 2004. The
    transfer to CIPS of UE’s service territory and favorable
    weather conditions offset gas inventory and other adjustments.
    The service territory transfer increased CIPS’ gas margin
    by $4 million in 2005.

CILCO (Illinois

See Non-rate-regulated Generation under Results of Operations
    for an explanation of CILCO’s (AERG) change in electric
    margin in 2005 compared with 2004.

CILCO’s (Illinois Regulated) electric margin increased by
    $11 million, or 8%, in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily
    because of increased native load growth, primarily in the
    industrial sector, along with more favorable summer weather in
    2005 than in 2004.

CILCO’s (Illinois Regulated) gas margin increased by
    $2 million in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily because of
    favorable weather in the fourth quarter of 2005.

IP

IP’s electric margin decreased by $11 million in 2005
    compared with 2004, primarily because of higher purchased power
    and MISO costs in 2005. Although power costs decreased in 2005
    under IP’s new power supply agreement with DYPM and related
    purchase accounting adjustments, costs on other power contracts
    were higher than in 2004. MISO costs included in purchased power
    were $9 million higher in 2005. The decrease in electric
    margin was reduced by weather that was more favorable in 2005
    than in 2004.

IP’s gas margin increased by $2 million, or 1%, in
    2005 compared with 2004 because of a rate increase effective in
    May 2005 that added $4 million. This benefit was reduced by
    unfavorable winter weather during the first quarter of 2005.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Non-rate-regulated Generation’s electric margin increased
    by $27 million, or 4%, in 2005 compared with 2004. See
    below for explanations of electric margin variances for the
    Non-rate-regulated Generation segment.



Genco

Genco’s electric margin decreased by $17 million in
    2005 compared with 2004. Factors contributing to a decrease in
    Genco’s electric margin were as follows:

•

A decrease in wholesale margins because Genco had to purchase
    higher-cost power to serve Marketing Company’s greater
    load. The increase in load was due to increased volume from the
    transfer of UE’s Illinois service territory to CIPS and

warmer-than-normal

weather. Increased purchased power, principally from UE under
    the JDA, was caused by a major power plant maintenance outage
    that occurred primarily during the first quarter of 2005.

•

A $26 million increase in emission allowance utilization in
    2005 compared with 2004. Emission allowance utilization was
    reduced in 2005 by a net gain of $15 million associated
    with a $21 million nonmonetary swap of certain earlier
    vintage-year
    SO


emission allowances for later vintage-year emission allowances,
    reduced by losses of $6 million on emission allowance
    options.

The decrease in Genco’s electric margin was reduced by a
    $23 million increase in margins on interchange sales in
    2005 over 2004. The increase in margins on interchange sales was
    the result of higher power prices and access to the MISO Day Two
    Energy Market. The MISO Day Two Energy Market resulted in an
    increase in margins on interchange sales by an estimated
    $10 million in 2005 over 2004 as a result of reduced
    transmission losses.

CILCO (AERG)

AERG’s electric margin decreased by $25 million, or
    22%, in 2005 compared with 2004. Factors contributing to an
    increase in AERG’s electric margin were as follows:

•

Lower margins on nonaffiliated interchange sales as output from
    AERG’s plants was reduced due to outages. The equivalent
    availability factor for AERG’s plants was 73% in 2005
    compared with 84% in 2004. The net capacity factor was 61% in
    2005 compared with 66% in 2004.

•

Higher fuel and purchased power costs because of unscheduled
    plant outages during the peak summer period and increased cost
    of emission allowance utilization totaling $20 million.

•

An $8 million increase in MISO costs in 2005 compared with
    2004.

The decrease in electric margin was reduced by the use of
    low-cost coal at one of AERG’s power plants in 2005.

EEI

EEI’s electric margin increased by $15 million in 2005
    compared with 2004, primarily because of sales of emission
    allowances.

Other Operations
    and Maintenance Expenses

2006 versus 2005

Ameren

Ameren’s other operations and maintenance expenses
    increased $69 million in 2006 over 2005. We experienced the
    most damaging storms in the Ameren utilities’ history in
    our service territory during the summer of 2006, resulting in
    the loss of power to about 950,000 electric customers and
    expenses of $28 million. Severe ice storms in the fourth
    quarter of 2006 resulted in the loss of power to about 520,000
    electric customers and expenses of $42 million.

Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses
    increased because of $25 million in costs related to the
    December 2005 reservoir breach at UE’s Taum Sauk plant and
    $15 million of contributions to assist residential
    customers in association with the Illinois Customer Elect
    electric rate increase phase-in plan accepted by the ICC in
    December 2006. In addition, there were higher power plant
    maintenance expenses at our coal-fired power plants due to the
    timing of maintenance outages, and an increase in legal fees for
    environmental issues and general litigation. The effect on other
    operations and maintenance expenses from transactions related to
    noncore properties, including the impairment of the Delta Air
    Lines, Inc., lease in 2005 as discussed below, was comparable
    between years. Reducing the unfavorable impact of the above
    items were lower labor costs and a decrease in bad debt expense
    of $17 million in 2006, primarily because an anticipated
    increase in uncollectible accounts due to high gas prices was
    mitigated by mild winter weather. In 2005, there was a Callaway
    nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage that resulted in
    other operations and maintenance expenses of $31 million;
    there was no refueling and maintenance outage in 2006. The next
    refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway plant is
    scheduled for the spring of 2007.

Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses at
    Ameren’s, CILCORP’s and CILCO’s business segments
    and for the Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 are outlined
    below.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $15 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of storm
    repair expenditures of $38 million, incremental costs
    associated with the Taum Sauk incident of $25 million, as
    noted above, and higher power plant maintenance expenses at
    UE’s coal-fired power plants. Reducing the impact of these
    unfavorable items were decreased injuries and damages expenses,
    decreased bad debt expenses, lower labor and employee benefit
    costs, and the lack of a scheduled Callaway refueling and
    maintenance outage in 2006, which resulted in other operations
    and maintenance expenses of $31 million in 2005.
    Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses
    decreased $7 million



in 2006 as a result of the transfer of UE’s Illinois
    service territory to CIPS in May 2005.

Illinois
    Regulated

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $45 million in 2006 compared with 2005 in the Illinois
    Regulated segment, as detailed below.

CIPS

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $13 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of storm
    repair expenditures of $6 million and the transfer of
    UE’s Illinois service territory to CIPS in May 2005, which
    resulted in additional other operations and maintenance expenses
    of $7 million. Additionally, other operations and
    maintenance expenses increased because of contributions of
    $4 million associated with the electric rate increase
    phase-in plan in 2006. The negative impact of these items was
    reduced by lower bad debt expense.

CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated)

Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased
    $5 million in 2006 from 2005, primarily because of lower
    employee benefit costs and reduced bad debt expenses. Reducing
    the benefit of these items were $3 million of contributions
    associated with the electric rate increase phase-in plan, along
    with storm repair and tree trimming expenditures of
    $5 million in 2006.

IP

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $46 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of storm
    repair expenditures of $24 million and contributions
    associated with the electric rate increase phase-in plan of
    $8 million in 2006, along with higher rental expenses, and
    higher injuries and damages expenses. The negative effect of
    these items was reduced by lower labor and employee benefit
    costs.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $28 million in 2006 compared with 2005 in the
    Non-rate-regulated Generation segment, as detailed below.

Genco

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $13 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of higher
    maintenance expenses resulting from increased scheduled power
    plant maintenance outages in 2006.

CILCO (AERG)

Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable
    between 2006 and 2005, as decreased maintenance costs were
    offset by increased legal and environmental expenses.

CILCORP (Parent
    Company Only) & EEI

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $8 million at CILCORP (Parent Company Only) and
    $3 million at EEI in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of
    increased employee benefit costs.

2005 versus 2004

Ameren

Ameren’s other operations and maintenance expenses
    increased $150 million in 2005 compared with 2004. IP
    expenses in the first nine months of 2005 added other operations
    and maintenance expenses of $166 million to Ameren (it was
    owned for only three months in 2004). Excluding these IP
    expenses, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased
    $16 million. Plant maintenance expenditures decreased as
    expenses related to the 2005 Callaway nuclear plant refueling
    and maintenance outage were lower in 2005 than in 2004, as
    discussed below. Lower employee benefit costs also resulted in
    reduced other operations and maintenance expenses in 2005.
    Ameren and several subsidiaries consummated the sale of noncore
    properties, including leveraged lease assets, in 2005. The net
    pretax gain on the sale of these assets was $26 million,
    which reduced other operations and maintenance expenses.
    Reducing these favorable items was an impairment of
    $10 million recorded in the third quarter of 2005 for
    Ameren’s investment in a leveraged lease of an aircraft to
    Delta Air Lines, Inc., which filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in
    September 2005. Additionally, labor costs, other than those
    incurred for the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage, were
    higher in 2005 compared with 2004. Ameren, UE and CIPS received
    a refund of previously paid exit fees totaling $18 million
    upon their reentry into the MISO during the second quarter of
    2004. This refund did not recur in 2005 and, therefore, other
    operations and maintenance expenses for this item increased in
    2005 relative to 2004.

Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses at
    Ameren’s, CILCORP’s and CILCO’s business segments
    and for the Ameren Companies between 2005 and 2004 were as
    follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Other operations and maintenance expenses at UE were comparable
    in 2005 and 2004. Maintenance and labor costs for refueling and
    maintenance outages were $31 million in 2005 compared with
    $39 million in 2004. The 2005 and 2004 refueling and
    maintenance outages each lasted about 64 days; however, in
    2005, the outage included more capital activities and less
    maintenance activities than in 2004. In 2005, Ameren replaced
    steam generators and turbine rotors in addition to normal
    maintenance procedures. Additionally, in 2004, there was an
    unscheduled outage at the Callaway nuclear plant and planned
    outages at two coal-fired plants. The transfer of UE’s
    Illinois service territory to CIPS in May 2005 decreased other
    operations and maintenance expenses



by $16 million in 2005. Reducing these favorable variances
    were increased labor costs and storm damage expenses in 2005.
    Additionally, UE received a $13 million MISO exit fee
    refund during 2004.

Illinois
    Regulated

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $154 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2005
    compared to 2004, primarily because of the additional nine
    months of IP results in 2005. Other variances between the years
    are discussed below.

CIPS

Other operations and maintenance expenses at CIPS were
    comparable in 2005 and 2004. Information technology, employee
    benefit, and administrative and general costs decreased in 2005.
    These positive items were offset by the transfer of UE’s
    Illinois service territory to CIPS, which resulted in an
    increase in other operations and maintenance expenses of
    $16 million in 2005. Additionally, CIPS received a
    $5 million MISO exit fee refund during 2004 that did not
    recur in 2005.

CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated)

Other operations and maintenance expenses at CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated) decreased $28 million in 2005 from 2004. These
    expenses decreased primarily because of lower employee benefit
    costs in 2005 and the absence of an $8 million charge we
    paid in 2004 to settle a litigation claim by Enron Power
    Marketing, Inc., in conjunction with Ameren’s acquisition
    of CILCORP in 2003.

IP

IP’s other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $39 million in 2005 over 2004, partly because IP received a
    refund of previously paid exit fees of $9 million from MISO
    during 2004. Other operations and maintenance expenses also
    increased, including tree trimming costs and overhead and labor
    costs associated with the integration of systems and operations
    with Ameren in 2005.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $13 million in 2005 compared with 2004 in the
    Non-rate-regulated Generation segment, as detailed below.

Genco

Other operations and maintenance expenses at Genco increased
    $4 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of a major
    power plant maintenance outage in 2005. These costs were reduced
    by lower employee benefit costs.

CILCORP (Parent
    Company Only)

Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable in
    2005 and 2004.

CILCO (AERG)

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $6 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of
    increased plant maintenance expenditures resulting from power
    plant outages.

EEI

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $5 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of
    increased power plant maintenance expenditures.

Depreciation and
    Amortization

2006 versus 2005

Ameren

Ameren’s depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $29 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of capital
    additions.

Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses at
    Ameren’s, CILCORP’s and CILCO’s business segments
    and for the Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 were as
    follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $25 million in 2006 over 2005. The increases were primarily
    because of capital additions, a portion of which were related to
    new steam generators and turbine rotors installed during the
    refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway nuclear plant
    in 2005, as well as CTs purchased in the first quarter of 2006.
    Additionally, depreciation increased due to CTs transferred to
    UE from Genco in May 2005. Reducing depreciation expense was the
    transfer of property to CIPS as part of the Illinois service
    territory transfer in May 2005.

Illinois
    Regulated

Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable in the
    Illinois Regulated segment, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP in
    2006 and 2005.

CIPS

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $3 million
    at CIPS primarily because of property transferred from UE to
    CIPS as part of the Illinois service territory transfer in May
    2005.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable in 2006
    and 2005 in the Non-rate-regulated Generation segment and for
    CILCORP (Parent Company only), Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI.



2005 versus 2004

Ameren

Ameren’s depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $75 million in 2005 from 2004, principally because of an
    additional nine months of IP results in 2005, which added
    $59 million. Capital additions also resulted in increased
    depreciation expenses in 2005.

Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses in
    Ameren’s, CILCORP’s and CILCO’s business segments
    and for the Ameren Companies between 2005 and 2004 were as
    follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Depreciation and amortization expenses at UE increased
    $16 million in 2005 over 2004. The increases were primarily
    due to capital additions and depreciation on CTs transferred
    from Genco to UE in May 2005, partially offset by the
    elimination of depreciation on property transferred by UE to
    CIPS in the Illinois service territory transfer in May 2005.

Illinois
    Regulated

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $66 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2005
    compared to 2004, primarily because of the additional nine
    months of IP results in 2005. Other variances between the years
    are discussed below.

CIPS

CIPS’ depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $7 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of
    depreciation on property transferred in May 2005 from UE in the
    Illinois service territory transfer and capital additions.

CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated)

Depreciation and amortization expenses at CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated) were comparable in 2005 and 2004.

IP

IP’s depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding the
    amortization of regulatory assets, were comparable in 2005 and
    2004. Amortization of regulatory assets at IP decreased
    $33 million in 2005 from 2004. The transition cost
    regulatory asset was eliminated in conjunction with
    Ameren’s acquisition of IP in September 2004.

Non-rate-regulated

Generation

Depreciation and amortization expenses in the

Non-rate-regulated

Generation segment decreased $4 million in 2005 compared
    with 2004, principally at Genco, because of the transfer of CTs
    from Genco to UE in May 2005.

Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable in 2005
    and 2004 at CILCORP (Parent Company Only), CILCO (AERG) and EEI.

Taxes Other Than
    Income Taxes

2006 versus 2005

Ameren

Ameren’s taxes other than income taxes increased
    $26 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily as a result of
    higher gross receipts, and higher excise taxes and property
    taxes.

Variations in taxes other than income taxes at Ameren’s,
    CILCORP’s and CILCO’s business segments and for the
    Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 were as follows.

    $5 million at IP in 2006 over 2005, primarily as a result
    of higher property taxes and excise taxes.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Taxes other than income taxes increased $7 million in 2006
    compared with 2005 at Non-rate-regulated Generation, primarily
    because of higher property taxes at Genco. There was a favorable
    court decision in the first quarter of 2005 that did not recur
    in 2006. Taxes other than income taxes were comparable in 2006
    and 2005 at CILCORP (Parent Company Only), CILCO (AERG), and EEI.

2005 versus 2004

Ameren

Ameren’s taxes other than income taxes increased

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

UE’s taxes other than income taxes increased
    $7 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of
    increased property taxes due to higher assessments. These
    property tax increases were mitigated in 2005 by the transfer of
    UE’s Illinois service territory to CIPS.



Illinois
    Regulated

Taxes other than income taxes increased $55 million in the
    Illinois Regulated segment in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily
    because of the additional nine months of IP results in 2005.
    Other variances between the years are discussed below.

CIPS

Taxes other than income taxes at CIPS were $7 million
    higher in 2005 than in 2004, primarily because of increased
    property taxes resulting from the transfer to CIPS of UE’s
    Illinois service territory in May 2005.

CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated)

Taxes other than income taxes decreased $4 million in 2005
    from 2004 at CILCO (Illinois Regulated), primarily because of
    reduced gross receipts and property taxes.

IP

    2004.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Taxes other than income taxes decreased $8 million in 2005
    compared with 2004 in the Non-rate-regulated Generation segment,
    primarily because of a favorable court decision in 2005
    regarding property taxes at Genco. Taxes other than income taxes
    were comparable in 2005 and 2004 at CILCORP (Parent Company
    Only), CILCO (AERG) and EEI.

Other Income and
    Expenses

2006 versus 2005

Ameren

Miscellaneous income increased $21 million in 2006 over
    2005, primarily because of $24 million of interest income
    on a taxable industrial development revenue bond acquired by UE
    in conjunction with its purchase of a CT in the first quarter of
    2006. See Note 2 – Acquisitions to our financial
    statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. This
    amount is offset by an equivalent amount of interest expense
    associated with a capital lease for the CT recorded in interest
    charges on Ameren’s and UE’s statements of income.
    Miscellaneous expense decreased $8 million, primarily due
    to decreased donations in 2006 and the write-off of
    unrecoverable natural gas costs in 2005.

Variations in other income and expenses in Ameren’s,
    CILCORP’s and CILCO’s business segments and for the
    Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 were as follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Miscellaneous income increased $16 million in 2006 over
    2005, primarily as a result of interest income on UE’s CT
    capital lease as noted above, partially offset by lower
    capitalization of equity funds used during construction in 2006.
    In 2005, UE replaced steam generators and turbine rotors at the
    Callaway nuclear plant. Miscellaneous expense was comparable in
    2006 and 2005.

2005 versus 2004

Ameren

Other income and expenses at Ameren decreased $10 million
    in 2005 compared with 2004. Excluding the additional nine months
    of IP results in 2005, other income and expenses at Ameren
    decreased $14 million from 2004. Miscellaneous income
    decreased $8 million, primarily due to reduced interest
    income from the investment of equity issuance proceeds in the
    prior year. Miscellaneous expense increased $6 million,
    primarily because of unrecoverable natural gas cost write-offs
    at CIPS and CILCO and integration costs at IP in 2005.

Variations in other income and expenses at Ameren’s,
    CILCORP’s and CILCO’s business segments and for the

    and for each of the Ameren Companies individually.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Interest expense increased $55 million in 2006 over 2005 as
    a result of the issuances of $300 million of senior secured
    notes in July 2005 and $260 million of senior secured notes
    in December 2005, along with increased short-term borrowings,
    resulting in part from the purchase of CTs in the first quarter
    of 2006. Interest expense of $24 million was recognized on
    UE’s capital lease associated with one of these CTs. This
    amount was offset by an equivalent amount of interest income
    recorded in Other income and deductions on Ameren’s and
    UE’s statements of income.

Illinois
    Regulated

Interest expense increased $9 million in 2006 compared with
    2005 in the Illinois Regulated segment, primarily because of the

    over 2004, principally because of the acquisition of IP, which
    added $32 million of interest for the first nine months of
    2005. Excluding the additional IP interest expense in 2005,
    Ameren’s interest expense decreased $9 million,
    primarily because of items discussed below in Ameren’s,
    CILCORP’s and CILCO’s business segments and for each
    of the Ameren Companies individually.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

UE’s interest expense increased $13 million in 2005
    over 2004, primarily because of the issuances of
    $300 million senior secured notes in July 2005,
    $85 million senior secured notes in January 2005, and
    $300 million senior secured notes in September 2004,
    partially offset by maturities of $188 million of first
    mortgage bonds in August 2004 and $85 million of first
    mortgage bonds in December 2004 and the redemption of
    $100 million first mortgage bonds in June 2004.

Illinois
    Regulated

Interest expense increased $24 million in the Illinois

CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated)

Interest expense was comparable in 2005 and 2004.

IP

Interest expense at IP decreased $87 million in 2005 from
    2004, primarily because of redemptions and repurchases of
    indebtedness of $700 million in the fourth quarter of 2004
    and $70 million in early 2005 and reductions in notes
    payable to IP SPT.



Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Interest expense decreased $27 million in 2005 compared
    with 2004 in the Non-rate-regulated Generation segment, as
    detailed below. Additionally, interest expense decreased
    $4 million at other non-rate-regulated subsidiaries,
    primarily because of reduced money pool borrowings.

Genco

Genco’s interest expense decreased $21 million in 2005
    from 2004, primarily because of the maturity of
    $225 million of senior notes in November 2005, lower
    average money pool borrowings, and a reduction in principal
    amounts outstanding on intercompany promissory notes to CIPS and
    Ameren. The outstanding balance on the intercompany note payable
    to CIPS was $197 million at December 31, 2005,

Effective tax rate increased in 2005 over 2004 in the
    Non-rate-regulated Generation segment, primarily because of the
    items detailed below.

Genco

Effective tax rate increased in 2005 over 2004, primarily
    because of increases in reserves for uncertain tax positions
    based on unfavorable developments with taxing authorities,
    offset by deductions under Section 199.

CILCORP (Parent
    Company Only)

Effective tax rate increased in 2005 over 2004, primarily
    because of increases related to unfavorable tax return to
    accrual adjustments.

CILCO (AERG)

Effective tax rate increased in 2005 over 2004, primarily
    because of an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions
    based on unfavorable developments with taxing authorities.

EEI

Effective tax rate decreased in 2005 from 2004, primarily
    because of benefits related to the Section 199 deduction.



LIQUIDITY AND
    CAPITAL RESOURCES

The tariff-based gross margins of Ameren’s rate-regulated
    utility operating companies (UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP) continue to
    be the principal source of cash from operating activities for
    Ameren and its rate-regulated subsidiaries. A diversified
    retail-customer mix of primarily rate-regulated residential,
    commercial and industrial classes and a commodity mix of gas and
    electric service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash
    flows for Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. For operating cash
    flows prior to 2007, Genco principally relied on power sales to
    an affiliate under a contract that expired at the end of 2006,
    and on sales to other wholesale and industrial customers under
    short and long-term contracts. Beginning in 2007, Genco and AERG
    will sell power previously sold under contracts that expired at
    the end of 2006 to Marketing Company, which has sold power
    through the Illinois power procurement auction and is selling
    power through other primarily market-based contracts with
    wholesale and retail customers. The amount of power that Genco,
    AERG, EEI, Marketing Company and their affiliates may supply to
    CIPS, CILCO and IP through the Illinois power procurement
    auction is limited to 35% of CIPS’, CILCO’s and
    IP’s aggregate annual load. In addition to cash flows from
    operating activities, each of the Ameren Companies plans to use
    available cash, money pool, or other short-term borrowings from
    affiliates, commercial paper, or credit facilities to support
    normal operations and other temporary capital requirements. The
    use of operating cash flows and short-term borrowings to fund
    capital expenditures and other investments may periodically
    result in a working capital deficit, as was the case at
    December 31, 2006, for Ameren, UE, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO
    and IP. The Ameren Companies will reduce their short-term
    borrowings with cash from operations or discretionarily with
    long-term borrowings or equity infusions from Ameren. See
    Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this
    report for a discussion of an Illinois legislative proposal to
    freeze electric rates at 2006 levels for CIPS, CILCO and IP. If
    such legislation is enacted, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP will
    not have enough operating cash flow to support normal
    operations, which would lead to financial insolvency.

Cash Flows from
    Operating Activities

2006 versus

Ameren’s cash from operations increased in 2006, compared
    with 2005. As discussed in Results of Operations, electric
    margins increased by $41 million, while gas margins
    decreased by $24 million. Benefiting operating cash flows
    were an $84 million decrease in pension and postretirement
    benefit contributions in 2006 compared with 2005, and the
    collection of

higher-than-normal

trade receivables caused by cold December 2005 weather during
    the winter heating season. The cash impact from trade
    receivables was more significant in the current period because
    we had higher gas prices and colder December weather in 2005
    than in the year-ago period. Negative impacts on operating cash
    flow include a $216 million increase in income tax
    payments, expenditures of $59 million (including a
    $10 million FERC fine) associated with the breach of the
    Taum Sauk upper reservoir in December 2005, and $37 million
    of other operations and maintenance expenses due to severe
    storms. Most of the Taum Sauk expenditures are pending recovery
    from insurance carriers. In addition, there was an increase in
    cash used during 2006 for payment of 2005 costs, including
    $9 million for other operations and maintenance and
    $14 million for annual incentive compensation. These
    expenses were higher than they were a year ago because of
    increased 2005 earnings relative to performance targets. The
    cash benefit from reduced natural gas inventories as a result of
    lower prices was offset by increased volume of coal inventory
    purchases because of the coal supply delivery issues experienced
    in 2005. See Note 14 – Commitments and
    Contingencies – Pumped-storage Hydroelectric Facility
    Breach to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for more information regarding the
    Taum Sauk incident.

At UE, cash from operating activities increased in 2006. Overall
    margins were higher in 2006 compared with 2005. Other operations
    and maintenance expenses were comparable with the previous year,
    despite $59 million (including $10 million for a FERC
    fine) spent due to the breach of the Taum Sauk upper reservoir
    collapse as



discussed above for Ameren, and $24 million spent due to
    severe storms. Pension and postretirement benefit contributions
    were $61 million less than in the prior year. Income tax
    payments increased $51 million, and interest payments
    increased $40 million because there was increased debt
    outstanding. Cash used for coal purchases increased compared
    with 2005 because of alleviation of the coal supply delivery
    issues experienced in 2005. Cash used for working capital
    increased, largely because of storm-related costs.

At CIPS, cash from operating activities decreased compared to
    the prior year. The negative cash effect of higher other
    operations and maintenance expenses was reduced by a small
    increase in electric and gas margins, as discussed in Results of
    Operations. Income tax payments increased $55 million
    compared with the year-ago period. Reducing this use of cash was
    a decrease in pension and postretirement benefit contributions
    of $11 million in 2006 compared with 2005, and an increase
    in collections of trade receivables as a result of colder
    December 2005 weather and higher gas prices than in the year-ago
    period.

Genco’s cash from operating activities in 2006 decreased
    compared with the 2005 period, primarily because of lower
    operating margins as discussed in Results of Operations, and
    increases in coal inventory. Income tax payments decreased in
    2006 by $17 million compared with 2005, pension and
    postretirement benefit payments decreased $9 million, and
    interest payments were lower in the 2006 period because there
    was less debt outstanding.

Cash from operating activities increased for CILCORP and CILCO
    in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily because of higher
    electric margins as discussed in Results of Operations, and an
    increase in collections of trade receivables as a result of
    colder December 2005 weather and higher gas prices than in the
    year-ago period. In addition, income tax payments decreased
    $25 million for CILCORP and $17 million for CILCO. An
    increase in coal deliveries at CILCO’s subsidiary, AERG,
    negatively affected cash.

IP’s cash from operations increased in 2006, compared with
    2005. Benefiting 2006 cash flows was the collection of

higher-than-normal

trade receivables caused by cold December 2005 weather during
    the heating season, as discussed above for Ameren, and a
    $1 million decrease in pension and postretirement benefit
    payments. These increases were reduced by lower electric margins
    and higher other operations and maintenance expenses, including
    $9 million related to severe storms, net income tax refunds
    of $13 million in 2006 compared with $22 million in
    2005, and cash used during 2006 for payment of 2005 costs as
    discussed above for Ameren, including an increase of
    $7 million in other operations and maintenance expenses,
    and an increase of $3 million in incentive compensation.

2005 versus

Ameren’s increase in cash from operations in 2005, compared
    with 2004, was primarily attributable to $207 million of
    incremental IP operating cash flow in the nine months ended
    September 30, 2005, since Ameren did not own IP during the
    comparable period in 2004. Excluding the impact of IP,
    Ameren’s increase in electric and gas margins of
    $14 million and $16 million, respectively, also
    contributed to the increase in cash from operations. In
    addition, decreased pension and other postretirement benefit
    contributions of $206 million and decreased interest
    payments of $30 million contributed to the favorable
    variance in cash from operations. Reducing the positive variance
    in 2005 were increased tax payments of $159 million, the
    absence in 2005 of $36 million of cash from the UE coal
    contract settlement received in 2004, and an increase in net
    investment in inventories and trade receivables and payables due
    to higher gas prices and colder weather in December 2005
    compared to December 2004. The absence in 2005 of
    $34 million of refunds in 2004 for previously paid fees to
    MISO and RTO

start-up

costs also reduced the positive variance in cash from
    operations. Ameren’s working capital investment in coal
    inventories as of December 31, 2005, did not change
    significantly, compared with 2004, as a million-ton decrease in
    volumes due to rail derailments was offset by higher prices.

At UE, cash from operating activities in 2005 was generally
    consistent with changes in its results of operations and its
    operating cash flows in 2004. A $127 million decrease in
    pension and postretirement contributions benefited 2005
    operating cash flow as compared with 2004. Significant items
    negatively impacting cash in 2005 compared with 2004 include:
    increased tax payments of $37 million; less cash from
    electric margins and emissions sales of $36 million; the
    impact of the coal contract settlement discussed above; the
    absence of $20 million received in 2004 for MISO exit fees
    and RTO

start-up

costs discussed above; and increased working capital investment,
    primarily because of timing differences, prices, and weather as
    discussed above.

CIPS’ increase in cash from operating activities in 2005
    was principally due to increased electric margins of
    $41 million, a reduction of $23 million in pension and
    postretirement benefit contributions, and reduced interest and
    tax payments. This was reduced by increases in cash outflows
    caused by differences in the timing and amount of working
    capital items, compared with 2004.

Cash from operating activities increased for Genco in 2005
    compared with 2004, primarily because of reduced pension and
    postretirement contributions of $20 million and lower
    interest payments of $39 million. Reducing this increase
    were increased tax payments of $41 million.

Cash from operating activities decreased for CILCORP and CILCO
    in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily because of increased tax
    payments of $60 million for CILCORP and $54 million
    for CILCO, lower electric margins of $16 million for
    CILCORP and $14 million for CILCO, and increased working
    capital investment at CILCORP and CILCO, primarily due to higher
    prices and colder weather, which increased inventories and
    receivables by $20 million and $28 million for CILCORP
    and $20 million and $31 million for CILCO.



CILCORP’s cash from operating activities was also
    negatively affected by additional interest payments of
    $14 million in 2005 compared with 2004. These decreases
    were reduced by a decrease in pension and other postretirement
    contributions of $33 million.

IP’s cash from operations in 2005 compared with 2004 was
    affected by Ameren’s ownership of IP for all of 2005
    compared with only the fourth quarter of 2004. IP’s
    operating cash flows in 2005 are not directly comparable with
    2004’s because of the integration of IP into Ameren’s
    operations, significant changes in capital structure,
    termination of certain of IP’s former affiliate agreements,
    and new purchased power arrangements, among other factors.
    IP’s cash from operations in 2005 benefited from lower
    taxes paid of $141 million, which resulted mostly from
    changes in taxable income and deferred tax benefits from
    accelerated depreciation resulting from the acquisition, and
    lower interest paid of $93 million. Negative impacts to
    IP’s operating cash in 2005 included the absence of
    $128 million of interest received from IP’s former
    affiliate, increased cash required for other operations and
    maintenance expenses of $59 million, and increased working
    capital investment. Significant drivers of the increase in
    working capital investment were colder weather and higher gas
    prices in December 2005, which increased receivables and gas
    inventories. IP’s gas sales were up 45% over December 2004.

Pension
    Funding

Ameren’s 2004 and 2005 contributions to the defined benefit
    retirement plan’s qualified trusts, among other things,
    provide cost savings, because they mitigate future benefit cost
    increases. In addition, the contribution in 2004 allowed us to
    avoid paying a portion of the insurance premium to the Pension
    Benefit Guaranty Trust Corporation. Federal interest rate relief
    expired on December 31, 2005. Based on our assumptions at
    December 31, 2006, and the new contribution requirements in
    the Pension Protection Act of 2006, in order to maintain minimum
    funding levels for Ameren’s pension plans, we do not expect
    future contributions to be required until 2009 at which time we
    would expect to contribute $100 million to
    $150 million. Required contributions of $150 million
    to $200 million each year are also expected for 2010 and
    2011. We expect the companies to share the obligation:
    UE – 61%; CIPS – 10%; Genco – 11%;
    CILCO – 7%; and IP – 11%. These amounts are
    estimates. They may change with actual stock market performance,
    changes in interest rates, any pertinent changes in government
    regulations, and any voluntary contributions. See
    Note 10 – Retirement Benefits to our financial
    statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for
    additional information.

Cash Flows from
    Investing Activities

2006 versus

Ameren’s increase in cash used in investing activities was
    primarily due to UE’s 2006 purchases of a

640-megawatt

CT facility from affiliates of NRG Energy, Inc., and

510-megawatt

and

340-megawatt

CT facilities from subsidiaries of Aquila, Inc., for a total of
    $292 million; increased nuclear fuel expenditures of
    $22 million; and $96 million of capital expenditures
    during 2006 related to the severe storms. The CT purchases are
    intended to meet UE’s increased generating capacity needs
    and to provide UE with additional flexibility in determining the
    timing of future base-load generating capacity additions.
    Emission allowance purchases decreased $50 million in 2006
    compared with 2005, while emission allowance sales increased
    $49 million. The sale of noncore properties in 2006
    provided a $56 million benefit to Ameren’s cash from
    investing activities as discussed below in the Sale of Noncore
    Properties section.

UE’s cash used in investing activities decreased in 2006,
    compared with the same period in 2005, principally because of a
    decrease in capital expenditures at the Callaway nuclear plant.
    This is due to UE spending $221 million for planned
    upgrades during a scheduled refueling outage in 2005. In
    addition, in 2006 UE received $67 million from CIPS as
    repayment of an intercompany note. The cash effect of the
    $292 million in CT purchases discussed above was more than
    the prior-year effect of the $237 million purchase of two
    CTs from Genco and the purchase of CT equipment from Development
    Company for $25 million. UE’s capital expenditures
    related to the 2006 storms referenced above were
    $47 million. In 2006, UE had a $13 million gain on the
    sale of a noncore property, and a $35 million increase in
    sales of emission allowances.

CIPS’ cash used in investing activities increased in 2006,
    compared with 2005. Capital expenditures increased
    $18 million. Also negatively impacting CIPS’ investing
    cash flow was an $18 million reduction in proceeds from
    CIPS’ note receivable from Genco in 2006 compared with
    2005. In addition, CIPS paid $17 million to repurchase its
    own outstanding bond. The bond remains outstanding, and CIPS is
    currently the holder and debtor. The bond is expected to be
    redeemed in 2007. The increased capital expenditures resulted
    partly from CIPS’ expansion of its service territory
    because of its acquisition of UE’s Illinois utility
    operations in May 2005. In addition, $16 million was
    expended as a result of storms. CIPS’ remaining capital
    expenditures were for projects to improve the reliability of its
    electric and gas transmission and distribution systems.

Genco had a net use of cash in investing activities for 2006,
    compared with a net source of cash for 2005. This was due
    primarily to the 2005 sale of two CTs to UE for
    $241 million. Purchases of emission allowances were
    $45 million less in 2006 than in 2005. Capital expenditures
    increased $9 million for 2006 compared with 2005.

CILCORP’s cash used in investing activities decreased, and
    CILCO’s increased in 2006, compared with 2005. Capital
    expenditures increased $12 million for CILCORP and CILCO,
    and net money pool advances decreased for each company by
    $42 million. CILCORP’s cash from investing activities
    further benefited from the repayment of Resources Company’s
    note payable of $71 million that originated from the 2005
    transfer of leveraged leases from CILCORP to



Resources Company. In addition, a subsidiary of CILCORP and
    CILCO generated cash from investing activities of
    $11 million in 2006, from the sale of its remaining
    leveraged lease investments. Emission allowance purchases were
    $9 million less in 2006 than in 2005.

IP had a net use of cash in investing activities for 2006,
    compared with a net source of cash for 2005, primarily because
    of the absence in 2006 of proceeds in 2005 from repayments for
    advances made to the money pool in prior-periods. In addition,
    capital expenditures increased $47 million over the
    year-ago period, which included $27 million as a result of
    severe storms, and increased expenditures to maintain the
    reliability of IP’s electric and gas transmission and
    distribution systems.

See Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to
    our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for a further discussion of future environmental
    capital investment estimates.

Intercompany
    Transfer of Illinois Service Territory

On May 2, 2005, UE completed the transfer of its
    Illinois-based electric and natural gas service territory to
    CIPS, at a net book value of $133 million. UE transferred
    50% of the assets directly to CIPS in consideration for a CIPS
    subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of
    $67 million and 50% of the assets by means of a dividend in
    kind to Ameren, followed by a capital contribution by Ameren to
    CIPS. The remaining principal balance of $61 million under
    the note was repaid in full by CIPS in June 2006.

Sale of Noncore
    Properties

In 2006, Ameren, UE, CILCORP, and CILCO generated proceeds
    totaling $56 million (2005 – $54 million),
    $13 million (2005 – $- million), $11 million
    (2005 – $13 million), and $11 million
    (2005 – $13 million), respectively, from the sale
    of certain noncore properties, including leveraged leases.

Prior to the 2005 leveraged lease sale, CILCORP transferred
    certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries that hold
    leveraged leases to Resources Company and AERG in exchange for a
    note receivable. Additionally, an indirect subsidiary of CILCORP
    that owned leveraged leases was transferred to AERG in exchange
    for a note receivable.

See Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements, under Part II, Item 8 of this
    report for a discussion of the noncore property sales.

2005 versus

Ameren had a decrease in cash used in investing activities,
    primarily because of $429 million used to acquire IP in
    2004. That decrease was partially offset by a $97 million
    increase in capital expenditures reflecting a full year of IP
    capital expenditures in 2005 compared with three months of IP
    expenditures in 2004, and the increased capital expenditures at
    UE discussed below.

UE’s cash used in investing activities increased in 2005,
    primarily because UE spent $237 million to purchase 550
    megawatts of CTs from Genco and $25 million to purchase CT
    equipment from Development Company. Excluding these CT
    acquisitions, UE’s capital expenditures in 2005 were
    consistent with those in 2004. UE maintained consistent plant
    expenditures by allocating fewer resources to projects at its
    coal-fired plants as it spent $221 million of expenditures
    at its Callaway nuclear plant for upgrades during a refueling
    and maintenance outage.

CIPS had a net use of cash in 2005 compared with net cash
    proceeds from investing activities in 2004, primarily because of
    an $18 million increase in capital expenditures and a
    $72 million reduction in cash received from principal
    payments on a note receivable from Genco. The increased capital
    expenditures were used to improve the reliability of CIPS’
    transmission and distribution systems.

Genco had a net source of cash in 2005, compared with a net use
    of cash from investing activities in 2004, primarily because of
    the sale of 550 megawatts of CTs at Pinckneyville and
    Kinmundy, Illinois, to UE for $241 million. The benefit of
    these proceeds was reduced by increased capital expenditures for
    upgrades at one of its power plants in 2005 and by an increase
    in emission allowance purchases of $64 million.

CILCORP’s and CILCO’s cash used in investing
    activities decreased in 2005 from 2004, primarily because
    CILCORP and CILCO reduced capital expenditures and received
    proceeds of $13 million in 2005 from the sale of leveraged
    leases. In 2004, CILCO’s subsidiary, AERG, made capital
    expenditures for significant power plant upgrades to increase
    fuel supply flexibility for power generation. The purchase of
    emission allowances negatively affected cash by $20 million
    more in 2005 than in 2004.

IP had net proceeds of cash in 2005 and a net use of cash in
    2004, primarily because of proceeds of $140 million for
    repayments of advances made to the money pool by IP in 2004.

Capital

(b)

The 2004 amounts include
    $100 million incurred prior to the acquisition date of
    September 30, 2004.



Ameren’s 2006 capital expenditures principally consisted of
    the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE purchased
    three CTs totaling $292 million. In addition, UE spent
    $40 million towards a scrubber at one of its power plants,
    and incurred storm damage expenditures of $47 million. CIPS
    and IP incurred storm damage-related expenditures of
    $16 million and $27 million, respectively. At Genco
    and AERG there was a cash outlay of $24 million and
    $11 million, respectively, for scrubber projects. The
    scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental
    regulations. Genco also made expenditures for a boiler upgrade
    of $16 million. Other capital expenditures were principally
    to maintain, upgrade and expand the reliability of the
    transmission and distribution systems of UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP.

Ameren’s and UE’s capital expenditures for 2005
    principally consisted of $221 million for steam generators,
    low pressure rotor replacements, and other upgrades during the
    2005 refueling and maintenance outage at UE’s Callaway
    nuclear plant. Ameren and UE also incurred expenditures of
    $65 million for three CTs at UE’s Venice plant,
    $60 million for numerous projects at UE’s generating
    plants, and $45 million for various upgrades to its
    transmission and distribution system. In addition, UE incurred
    expenditures of $237 million for CTs purchased from Genco,
    as discussed above. CILCORP’s and CILCO’s capital
    expenditures included $29 million for ongoing generation
    plant projects to improve flexibility in future fuel supply for
    power generation. In addition, CILCO, CIPS, and IP incurred
    expenditures to maintain, upgrade and expand the reliability of
    their electric and gas transmission and distribution systems.

Ameren’s capital expenditures for 2004 were made
    principally for various upgrades at UE’s power plants,
    including the replacement of condenser bundles, and other
    upgrades during the 2004 refueling and maintenance outage at
    UE’s Callaway nuclear plant. The replacement and upgrade
    work at UE’s Callaway plant resulted in capital
    expenditures of $40 million in 2004. In addition, UE
    incurred costs for steam generators and low pressure rotors that
    were replaced during the 2005 refueling and maintenance outage
    at the Callaway nuclear plant. UE also incurred capital
    expenditures related to the installation of new CTs at its
    Venice plant and replacement of turbines at two of its power
    plants in 2004. In addition, UE’s capital expenditures
    included environmental and other upgrades at its power plants
    and expenditures for new transmission and distribution lines.
    CILCORP’s and CILCO’s capital expenditures in 2004
    were primarily related to power plant projects to improve
    flexibility in future fuel supply for power generation.
    Genco’s 2004 capital expenditures were primarily attributed
    to the replacement of a turbine generator at one of its power
    plants. Capital expenditures at IP and CIPS consisted of
    numerous projects to upgrade and maintain the reliability of
    their respective electric and gas transmission and distribution
    systems and to add new customers to the systems.

The following table estimates the capital expenditures that will
    be incurred by the Ameren Companies from 2007 through 2011,
    including construction expenditures, capitalized interest and
    allowance for funds used during construction (except for Genco,
    which has no allowance for funds used during construction), and
    estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental
    standards:

UE’s estimated capital expenditures include transmission,
    distribution and generation-related activities, as well as
    expenditures for compliance with new environmental regulations
    discussed below.

CIPS’, CILCO’s, and IP’s estimated capital
    expenditures are primarily for electric and gas transmission and
    distribution-related activities. Genco’s estimated capital
    expenditures are primarily for upgrades to existing coal and
    gas-fired generating facilities and compliance with new
    environmental regulations. CILCO (AERG)’s estimate includes
    capital expenditures for generation-related activities, as well
    as for compliance with new environmental regulations at
    AERG’s generating facilities.

We continually review our generation portfolio and expected
    power needs. As a result, we could modify our plan for
    generation capacity, which could include changing the times when
    certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio,
    the type of generation asset technology that will be employed,
    and whether capacity or power may be purchased, among other
    things. Any changes that we may plan to make for future
    generating needs could result in significant capital
    expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material.

Environmental
    Capital Expenditures

Ameren, UE, Genco, AERG and EEI will incur significant costs in
    future years to comply with EPA and state regulations regarding
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions
    (the Clean Air Mercury Rule) from coal-fired power plants.

The EPA issued final
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emission regulations in May 2005. The rules require
    significant reductions in these emissions from UE, Genco, AERG
    and EEI power plants in phases, beginning in 2009. States were
    mandated to develop their own regulations as well. In February
    2007, the Missouri Air Conservation Commission approved the
    proposed federal Clean Air Mercury and Clean Air Interstate
    rules, which substantially follow the federal rules. In December
    2006, the Illinois Pollution Control Board adopted the mercury
    regulations, which are significantly stricter than the federal
    rules. Illinois has proposed rules to implement the federal
    Clean Air Interstate Rule program;



however it is anticipated that the rules will not be finalized
    until the second quarter of 2007. The table below presents
    estimated capital costs based on current technology to comply
    with both (1) the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule and
    Clean Air Mercury Rule through 2016, and (2) Illinois’
    mercury regulations pursuant to an agreement between Genco,
    CILCO, EEI, and the Illinois EPA. Under the agreement, Genco,
    CILCO and EEI may delay the compliance date for mercury
    reductions in exchange for accelerated installation of
    NO

x

and
    SO


controls. The agreement with the Illinois EPA also restricts
    purchasing
    SO


and
    NO

x

emission allowances to meet specific allowed emission rates set
    forth in the agreement. The estimates described below could
    change depending upon additional federal or state requirements,
    new technology, variations in costs of material or labor or
    alternative compliance strategies, among other reasons. The
    timing of estimated capital costs may also be influenced by
    whether emission allowances are used to comply with the proposed
    rules, thereby deferring capital investment.

UE’s expenditures are expected to be recoverable in rates
    over time.

Illinois and Missouri must also develop attainment plans to meet
    the federal

eight-hour

ozone ambient standard by June 2007 and the federal fine
    particulate ambient standard by April 2008. The costs in the
    table assume that emission controls required for the Clean Air
    Interstate Rule regulations will be sufficient to meet this new
    standard in the St. Louis region. Should Missouri develop
    an alternative plan to comply with this standard, the cost
    impact could be material to UE. Illinois is planning to impose
    additional requirements beyond the Clean Air Interstate Rule as
    part of the attainment plans for ozone and fine particulate. At
    this time, we are unable to determine the impact state actions
    would have on our results of operations, financial position, or
    liquidity.

See Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to
    our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for a further discussion of environmental matters.

Cash Flows from
    Financing Activities

2006 versus

Ameren had a net source of cash from financing activities in
    2006, compared with a net use of cash in 2005. Positive effects
    on cash included a net increase of $419 million in net
    short-term debt proceeds in 2006, compared with net repayments
    of $224 million of short-term debt in 2005 and a
    $454 million decrease in long-term debt redemptions,
    repurchases and maturities. Negative effects on cash included a
    $411 million reduction in long-term debt proceeds from the
    year-ago period, and a $358 million reduction in proceeds
    from the issuance of common stock. The reduction in common stock
    proceeds was due to the issuance of 7.4 million shares in
    the 2005 period related to the settlement of a stock purchase
    obligation in Ameren’s adjustable conversion-rate equity
    security units.

UE had a net use of cash used in financing activities in 2006,
    compared with a net source of cash in 2005. The absence of
    long-term debt issuances in 2006, compared with
    $643 million of long-term debt issuances in 2005, was the
    primary reason for the change, but this negative effect on cash
    flow was reduced by net changes in short-term debt that resulted
    in a $154 million positive effect on cash in 2006, compared
    with a $295 million negative effect on cash in 2005. In
    addition, dividend payments decreased $31 million in the
    2006 period from 2005, and net money pool borrowings increased
    $79 million. Cash from financing activities in 2006 was
    used principally to fund CT acquisitions.

CIPS’ cash used in financing activities decreased in 2006,
    compared with 2005, principally because of the issuance of
    $61 million of long-term debt that was used with other
    available corporate funds to repay CIPS’ outstanding
    balance on the intercompany note payable to UE. That note was
    originally issued as 50% of the consideration for UE’s
    Illinois service territory, which was transferred to CIPS in
    2005. Cash was also positively affected by a $64 million
    net decrease in money pool repayments and borrowings of
    $35 million under the 2006 $500 million credit
    facility in 2006. A $15 million increase in dividends to
    Ameren negatively affected CIPS’ cash from financing
    activities in 2006, compared with the year-ago period.

Genco had a net decrease in cash used in financing activities
    for 2006, compared with 2005, principally because of
    $200 million of capital contributions received in 2006 from
    Ameren. These capital contributions were made to reduce
    Genco’s money pool borrowings. In 2005, Genco used the
    $241 million from the sale of CTs to UE along with other
    funds to retire $225 million of maturing debt and to make
    principal payments on intercompany notes with CIPS and Ameren.
    Reducing these positive effects on cash was a $25 million
    increase in dividend payments in the 2006 period compared with
    the 2005 period.

CILCORP had a net use of cash in 2006, compared with a net
    source of cash in 2005. CILCO’s cash provided by financing
    activities decreased in 2006, compared with 2005. Net money pool
    repayments increased $142 million at CILCORP and
    $145 million at CILCO. CILCORP’s net repayments of
    $113 million on its note payable to Ameren reduced its
    financing cash flow by $227 million compared with the
    year-ago period, because 2005 included net borrowings on this
    note that provided CILCORP with cash. Positive effects on cash
    flow include long-term debt issuances that generated
    $96 million in 2006, compared with no long-term debt
    issuances in 2005. The proceeds from this debt were used to
    redeem $21 million of long-term debt and to reduce money
    pool borrowings. In addition, CILCORP borrowed $215 million
    and CILCO (and CILCO’s subsidiary



AERG) borrowed $165 million under the 2006
    $500 million credit facility, net of repayments. In 2006,
    CILCORP used cash of $33 million for redemptions,
    repurchases and maturities of long-term debt, compared with
    $101 million in the 2005 period. CILCO’s cash used for
    redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long-term debt was
    comparable in the two years. These positive effects on cash in
    2006 were partially offset by the absence in 2006 of a
    $102 million capital contribution received in 2005 from
    Ameren, which was made to reduce CILCO’s short-term debt.
    Also contributing to CILCORP’s and CILCO’s increase in
    cash used in financing activities for 2006, compared with 2005,
    were increased common stock dividends of $20 million at
    CILCORP and $45 million at CILCO.

IP had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2006,
    compared with a net use of cash in 2005. This was partly because
    of lower redemptions and repurchases of long-term debt of
    $70 million. More debt was repaid in 2005 to improve
    IP’s credit profile. Other positive effects on cash from
    financing activities included the absence in 2006 of
    $76 million of common stock dividend payments made in 2005,
    net borrowings of $75 million on the 2006 $500 million
    credit facility, and the issuance of $75 million of
    long-term debt in 2006 compared with no long-term debt proceeds
    in 2005. The $75 million was used to reduce money pool
    borrowings.

2005 versus

Ameren had a net use of cash used for financing activities in
    2005, compared with a net source of cash in 2004, primarily
    because of a $1 billion decrease in proceeds from common
    stock issuances in 2005 compared with 2004. The common stock
    proceeds in 2004 were principally used to fund the acquisition
    of IP and Dynegy’s 20% interest in EEI on
    September 30, 2004, and to repurchase and redeem certain IP
    indebtedness subsequent to the acquisition. In 2005, total
    common stock proceeds of $454 million included
    $345 million from the issuance of 7.4 million shares
    of common stock related to the settlement of a stock purchase
    obligation in Ameren’s adjustable conversion-rate equity
    security units. The 2005 increase in cash used in financing
    activities was also attributable to $224 million of net
    redemptions of short-term debt, compared with net proceeds of
    $256 million in 2004. Decreased long-term debt redemptions
    of $847 million, increased long-term debt issuances of
    $185 million, and the absence in 2005 of a $67 million
    UE nuclear fuel lease payment in 2004 partially offset the
    decrease in cash from financing activities in 2005.

UE cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005,
    compared with 2004, primarily because of a $374 million
    decrease in long-term debt redemptions, a $239 million
    increase in issuances of long-term debt, a $35 million
    decrease in the payment of dividends to Ameren, and the absence
    of a $67 million nuclear fuel lease payment that was made
    in 2004. These 2005 benefits in cash from financing activities
    were partially offset by $295 million used for short-term
    debt repayments; in 2004, UE had net proceeds from short-term
    debt.

CIPS’ cash used in financing activities decreased in 2005
    from 2004, primarily because of a $40 million cash increase
    from reduced dividends paid to Ameren, and decreased long-term
    debt redemptions of $50 million. These positive effects on
    cash were partially offset by decreased issuances of long-term
    debt of $35 million and net repayments of utility money
    pool borrowings of $13 million.

Genco’s cash used in financing activities increased in 2005
    from 2004, primarily because of a $225 million long-term
    debt redemption in 2005 and increased payments of
    $30 million on its note payable to Ameren. The funds for
    these repayments came from the $241 million in proceeds
    from the 2005 sale of 550 megawatts of CTs to UE. Net cash used
    in financing activities also increased because of a capital
    contribution decrease of $72 million. A reduction of
    $72 million in payments on a note payable to CIPS and a net
    increase in non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool borrowings
    of $95 million, partially offset the additional uses of
    cash.

Effective May 1, 2005, Genco and CIPS amended certain terms
    of Genco’s subordinated affiliate note payable to CIPS by
    issuing to CIPS an amended and restated subordinated promissory
    note for $249 million with an interest rate of
    7.125% per year, a five-year amortization schedule, and a
    maturity of May 1, 2010.

CILCORP and CILCO had a net source of cash in financing
    activities in 2005, compared with a net use of cash in 2004. For
    CILCORP, an $88 million increase in proceeds from an
    intercompany note payable to Ameren and from decreased long-term
    debt redemptions of $41 million benefited cash. Reducing
    these increases were an increase in net repayments of money pool
    borrowings of $33 million and lower long-term debt
    issuances of $19 million. CILCO’s increase in cash
    from financing activities was mainly due to decreased long-term
    debt redemptions of $103 million and increased capital
    contributions from Ameren of $27 million. Reducing these
    increases were increased net repayments of utility money pool
    borrowings of $36 million and increased dividend payments
    of $10 million.

IP had a net use of cash in investing activities in 2005,
    compared with a net source of cash in 2004, primarily because
    2004 included an $871 million capital contribution from
    Ameren. IP’s $76 million increase in dividends to
    Ameren also contributed to IP’s increase in cash used in
    financing activities. These negative effects on cash were
    reduced by lower redemptions and repurchases of long-term debt
    of $732 million and by $75 million of cash received
    from utility money pool borrowings.

Short-term
    Borrowings and Liquidity

Short-term borrowings typically consist of commercial paper
    issuances and drawings under committed bank credit facilities
    with maturities of 1 to 45 days. See
    Note 5 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of



this report for additional
    information on credit facilities, short-term borrowing activity,
    relevant interest rates, and borrowings under Ameren’s
    utility and non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool
    arrangements.

The following table presents the various committed bank credit
    facilities of the Ameren Companies as of February 9, 2007,
    and the availability as of December 31, 2006:

At December 31, 2006, Ameren and certain of its
    subsidiaries had $1.65 billion of committed credit
    facilities, consisting of two facilities as described below, in
    the amounts of $1.15 billion and $500 million.

Ameren could directly borrow under the $1.15 billion
    facility up to the entire amount of the facility; UE could
    directly borrow under this facility up to $500 million on a

364-day

basis; and Genco could directly borrow under this facility up to
    $150 million on a

364-day

basis. This facility was also available for use, subject to
    applicable regulatory short-term borrowing authorizations, by
    EEI or other Ameren non-state-regulated subsidiaries through
    direct short-term borrowings from Ameren and by most of
    Ameren’s non-rate-regulated subsidiaries, including, but
    not limited to, Ameren Services, Resources Company, Genco, AERG,
    Marketing Company, AFS and Ameren Energy, through a
    non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. Ameren has
    money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries to
    coordinate and to provide for certain short-term cash and
    working capital requirements. Separate money pools are
    maintained for utility and non-state-regulated entities. In
    addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement among Ameren, IP and
    Ameren Services enables IP to make short-term borrowings
    directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings
    outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral borrowing
    agreement and the utility money pool agreement, together with
    any outstanding external short-term borrowings by IP, may not
    exceed $500 million pursuant to authorization from the ICC.
    IP is not currently borrowing under the unilateral borrowing
    agreement.

Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration
    of the agreements. See Note 5 – Credit Facilities
    and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for a detailed explanation of the
    money pool arrangements and the unilateral borrowing agreement.

In addition to committed credit facilities, a further source of
    liquidity for Ameren from time to time is available cash and
    cash equivalents. At December 31, 2006, Ameren had
    $137 million of cash and cash equivalents.

The issuance of short-term debt securities by Ameren’s
    utility subsidiaries is subject to approval by FERC under the
    Federal Power Act. In March 2006, FERC issued an order
    authorizing these subsidiaries to issue short-term debt
    securities subject to the following limits on outstanding
    balances: UE – $1 billion; CIPS –
    $250 million; and CILCO – $250 million. The
    authorization was effective as of April 1, 2006, and
    terminates on March 31, 2008. IP has unlimited short-term
    debt authorization from FERC.

Genco is authorized by FERC in its March 2006 order to have up
    to $300 million of short-term debt outstanding at any time.
    AERG and EEI have unlimited short-term debt authorization from
    FERC.

With the repeal of PUHCA 1935, the issuance of short-term
    unsecured debt securities by Ameren and CILCORP, which was
    previously subject to SEC approval under PUHCA 1935, is no
    longer subject to approval by any regulatory body.

The Ameren Companies continually evaluate the adequacy and
    appropriateness of their credit arrangements given changing
    business conditions. When business conditions warrant, changes
    may be made to existing credit agreements or other short-term
    borrowing arrangements.



Long-term Debt

In March 2004, the SEC declared effective a

Form S-3

registration statement filed by Ameren in February 2004,
    authorizing the offering of 6 million additional shares of
    its common stock under DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under
    DRPlus are, at Ameren’s option, newly issued shares,
    treasury shares, or shares purchased in the open market or in
    privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently selling
    newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus.

Ameren is also currently selling newly issued shares of its
    common stock under certain of its 401(k) plans pursuant to
    effective SEC

Form S-8

registration statements. Under DRPlus and its 401(k) plans,
    Ameren issued 1.9 million, ($96 million) shares of
    common stock in 2006, 2.1 million ($109 million) in
    2005, and 2.3 million ($107 million) in 2004.

Ameren, UE and CIPS may sell all or a portion of the remaining
    securities registered under their effective registration
    statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant
    such a sale. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a
    prospectus that meets the requirements of the Securities Act of
    1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Indebtedness
    Provisions and Other Covenants

See Note 5 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity to
    our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for a discussion of the covenants and provisions
    contained in our bank credit facilities and applicable
    cross-default provisions. Also see Note 6 –
    Long-term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements
    under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion
    of covenants and provisions contained in certain of the Ameren
    Companies’ indenture agreements and articles of
    incorporation.

At December 31, 2006, the Ameren Companies were in
    compliance with their credit facility, indenture, and articles
    of incorporation provisions and covenants.

We consider access to short-term and long-term capital markets a
    significant source of funding for capital requirements not
    satisfied by our operating cash flows. Inability to raise
    capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of
    uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect our
    ability to maintain and expand our businesses. After assessing
    our current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings
    (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that we will continue to
    have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our
    control, such as the legislation proposed to freeze electric
    rates at 2006 levels in Illinois for CIPS, CILCO and IP, may
    create



uncertainty in the capital markets. Such events would probably
    increase our cost of capital or adversely affect our ability to
    access the capital markets. See Note 3 – Rate and
    Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion.

Dividends

Ameren paid to its shareholders common stock dividends totaling
    $522 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2006,
    $511 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2005, and
    $479 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2004. This
    resulted in a payout rate based on net income of 95% in 2006,
    84% in 2005, and 90% in 2004. Dividends paid to common
    shareholders in relation to net cash provided by operating
    activities for the same periods were 41% in 2006, 41% in 2005
    and 43% in 2004.

The amount and timing of dividends payable on Ameren’s
    common stock are within the sole discretion of Ameren’s
    board of directors. The board of directors has not set specific
    targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock
    dividends. However, the board considers various issues,
    including Ameren’s historical earnings and cash flow,
    projected earnings, projected cash flow and potential cash flow
    requirements, dividend payout rates at other utilities, return
    on investments with similar risk characteristics, and overall
    business considerations. On February 9, 2007, Ameren’s
    board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of
    63.5 cents per share payable on March 30, 2007, to
    shareholders of record on March 7, 2007.

Certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational
    documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other
    things, restrict the Ameren Companies’ payment of
    dividends. UE would be restricted as to dividend payments on its
    common and preferred stock if it were to extend or defer
    interest payments on its subordinated debentures. CIPS’
    articles of incorporation require its dividend payments on
    common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total
    capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating
    expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Genco’s
    indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making any
    dividend payments on common stock if debt service coverage
    ratios are below a defined threshold. CILCORP has common and
    preferred stock dividend payment restrictions if leverage ratio
    and interest coverage ratio thresholds are not met, or if
    CILCORP’s senior long-term debt does not have the ratings
    described in its indenture. CILCO has restrictions in its
    articles of incorporation on dividend payments on common stock
    relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the
    annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock and amounts
    to be set aside for any sinking fund retirement of its 5.85%
    Series preferred stock. At December 31, 2006, except as
    described below with respect to the 2006 $500 million
    credit facility, none of these conditions existed at the Ameren
    Companies. As a result, they were allowed to pay dividends. The
    restrictions on the ability of IP to declare and pay dividends
    on its common stock that were established by the ICC order
    approving Ameren’s acquisition of IP terminated in December
    2006 with IP’s redemption of the remaining $33,000 of its
    11.50% series mortgage bonds due 2010. This ICC order also
    requires IP to establish a dividend policy comparable to that of
    Ameren’s other Illinois utilities and consistent with
    achieving and maintaining a common

equity-to-total-capitalization

ratio between 50% and 60%.

On July 14, 2006, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP, and AERG
    entered into a $500 million multiyear, senior secured
    credit facility (the “2006 $500 million credit
    facility”). This facility limits CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and
    IP to common and preferred stock dividend payments of
    $10 million per year each if CIPS’, CILCO’s or
    IP’s senior secured long-term debt securities or first
    mortgage bonds, or CILCORP’s senior unsecured long-term
    debt securities, get a below-investment-grade credit rating from
    either Moody’s or S&P. With respect to AERG, which
    currently is not rated by Moody’s or S&P, the common
    and preferred stock dividend restriction will not apply if its
    consolidated total debt to consolidated operating cash flow
    ratio, pursuant to a calculation defined in the facilities, is
    less than or equal to 3.0 to 1. On July 26, 2006,
    Moody’s downgraded CILCORP’s senior unsecured credit
    rating to below investment – grade, causing it to be
    subject to this dividend payment limitation. As of
    December 31, 2006, AERG failed to meet the

debt-to-operating

cash flow ratio test in the 2006 $500 million credit
    facility. AERG therefore is currently limited in its ability to
    pay dividends to a maximum of $10 million per fiscal year.
    The other borrowers are not currently limited in their dividend
    payments by this provision of the 2006 $500 million credit
    facility. On February 9, 2007, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and
    AERG entered into another $500 million multiyear senior
    secured credit facility (the “2007 $500 million credit
    facility”) which contains identical provisions restricting
    the payment of dividends. See Note 5 – Credit
    Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report.

(b)

Before October 2004, the ICC
    prohibited IP from paying dividends. If permitted, IP’s
    dividends would have been paid directly to Illinova and
    indirectly to Dynegy.

Certain of the Ameren Companies have issued preferred stock on
    which they are obligated to make preferred dividend payments.
    Each company’s board of directors considers the declaration
    of the preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a
    certain date, stating the date on which the dividend is payable
    and the amount to be paid. See Note 9 –

Off-Balance-Sheet
    Arrangements

At December 31, 2006, none of the Ameren Companies had any
    off-balance-sheet financing arrangements other than operating
    leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. None of
    the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant
    off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in the near future.

On October 10, 2006, Moody’s placed the long-term
    credit ratings of Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP
    under review for possible downgrade, and affirmed the commercial
    paper ratings of Ameren and UE. Moody’s had removed the
    review for possible downgrade in July 2006. According to
    Moody’s, the review for possible downgrade was reinstituted
    because of concerns that the timely recovery of increased
    utility costs could be impaired by legislative action in
    Illinois, specifically the rate freeze legislation discussed in
    Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report. Moody’s stated that enactment of the rate freeze
    legislation in Illinois would be expected to result in a
    multi-notch downgrade of the ratings of CIPS, CILCO and IP to
    speculative

(sub-investment)

grade, reflecting the severe impact such action would have on
    the utilities’ cash flow and liquidity. Moody’s has
    also indicated that if legislation freezing rates at 2006
    levels, or similar legislation that restricts the recovery of
    costs in a timely manner, becomes a substantial possibility, it
    may consider additional credit ratings downgrades with regard to
    one or more of the Ameren Companies.

On October 10, 2006, Fitch placed the credit ratings of
    Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP on rating watch negative.
    The ratings of UE and Genco were affirmed and not affected by
    these rating actions. The negative rating watch resulted from
    the heightened political rhetoric surrounding future utility
    rates in Illinois and uncertainty related to recovery of
    CIPS’, CILCORP’s, CILCO’s and IP’s purchased
    power costs.

On October 5, 2006, S&P, in reaction to the intensified
    political discussion in Illinois regarding possible legislation
    freezing rates at 2006 levels, downgraded the credit ratings of
    the Ameren Companies. As a result of S&P’s downgrade of
    Ameren’s and UE’s short-term ratings to

A-3,

Ameren
    and UE are currently limited in their access to the commercial
    paper market. All of the S&P credit ratings for the Ameren
    Companies remain on credit watch with negative implications.
    According to S&P, it will continue to lower the Ameren
    Companies credit ratings if, in its opinion, the likelihood of
    Illinois legislation freezing electric rates at 2006 levels
    increases. If the legislation is passed, S&P will lower
    ratings on CIPS, CILCO, CILCORP and IP to
    “B” – a deep junk or speculative credit
    rating category.

Any adverse change in the Ameren Companies’ credit ratings
    may reduce access to capital. It may also increase the cost of
    borrowing and fuel, power and gas supply, among other things,
    resulting in a negative impact on earnings. For example, if at
    December 31, 2006, the Ameren Companies had a

sub-investment-grade

rating (less than BBB- or Baa3), Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco,
    CILCORP, CILCO or IP could have been required to post collateral
    or other assurances for certain trade obligations amounting to
    $236 million, $43 million, $22 million,
    $21 million, $40 million, $40 million, or
    $72 million, respectively. In addition, the cost of
    borrowing under our credit facilities can increase or decrease
    depending upon the credit ratings of the borrower. Suppliers may
    request prepayment for products and services. A credit rating is
    not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. It should
    be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are
    subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating
    organization.

OUTLOOK

Below are some key trends that may affect the Ameren
    Companies’ financial condition, results of operations, or
    liquidity in 2007 and beyond.

Revenues

•

In 2006, electric rate freezes or adjustment moratoriums and
    power supply contracts expired in Ameren’s regulatory
    jurisdictions. At the end of 2006, electric rates for
    Ameren’s operating subsidiaries had been fixed or declining
    for periods ranging from 15 years to 25 years. In
    January 2006, the ICC approved a framework for CIPS, CILCO and
    IP to procure power for use by their customers through an
    auction. It also approved the related tariffs to collect these
    costs from customers for the period commencing January 2,
    2007. This approval is subject to pending court appeals. In
    September 2006, the power procurement auction was held and
    declared successful with respect to power for fixed-price
    customers, the vast majority of electric customers of CIPS,
    CILCO and IP. The auction clearing price was about $65 per
    megawatthour for the fixed-price residential and small
    commercial product and about $85 per megawatthour for large
    commercial and industrial customers. Marketing Company
    participated in the auction with power being acquired from Genco
    and AERG, subject to an auction rules limitation of providing no
    more than 35% of the Ameren Illinois Utilities’ expected
    annual load, and it was awarded sales in the auction. As a
    result of the high auction price for the large commercial and
    industrial customers, almost all of these customers chose a
    different supplier.

•

In 2006, the Non-rate-regulated Generation segment generated
    30 million megawatthours of power (Genco –
    15 million, AERG – 7 million,
    EEI – 8 million). Power previously supplied by
    Genco to CIPS and by AERG to CILCO was subject to
    below-market-priced contracts that expired on December 31,
    2006. All but 5 million megawatthours of Genco’s
    pre-2006 wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements
    also expired during 2006. About 1 million megawatthours of
    these



contracts expire by the end of 2007 and another 2 million
    expire by the end of 2008. Substantially all of these contracts
    involved below-market prices. These agreements had an average
    embedded selling price of $36 per megawatthour. In 2006,
    Genco also sold 2.1 million net megawatthours of power in
    the interchange market at an average market price of
    $38 per megawatthour. In 2006, AERG’s power was sold
    principally to CILCO, at an average price of $32 per
    megawatthour. In addition, AERG sold 1.5 million net
    megawatthours of power in the interchange market at an average
    price of $37 per megawatthour in 2006. The
    Non-rate-regulated Generation segment expects to generate
    32 million megawatthours of power in 2007
    (Genco – 17 million, AERG –
    7 million, EEI – 8 million). Genco, AERG and
    EEI have contracts to sell all their power to Marketing Company.
    Marketing Company will resell this power and provide the net
    proceeds to Genco and AERG.

•

The marketing strategy for Non-rate-regulated Generation is to
    optimize our generation output in a low risk manner to minimize
    earnings and cash flows volatility, while capitalizing on our
    low-cost generation fleet to provide for solid, sustainable
    returns. Through a mix of physical and financial sales
    contracts, and the Illinois 2006 power procurement auction,
    Non-rate-regulated Generation has sold approximately 90% of its
    expected 2007 generation output (29 million megawatthours)
    at an average price of $51 per megawatthour. Expected sales
    in 2007 include an estimated 7.6 million megawatthours of
    power sold through the Illinois power procurement auction at
    about $65 per megawatthour (2008 –
    6.8 million, 2009 – 4.3 million). Including
    auction sales, approximately 55% of the expected generation
    output in 2008 is sold.

•

CIPS, CILCO and IP filed rate cases with the ICC in December
    2005 to modify their electric delivery service rates effective
    January 2, 2007. CIPS, CILCO and IP requested to increase
    their annual revenues for electric delivery service by
    $202 million in the aggregate (CIPS –
    $14 million, CILCO – $43 million and
    IP – $145 million). In November 2006, the ICC
    issued an order approving an annual revenue increase for
    electric delivery service of $97 million in the aggregate
    (CIPS – $8 million decrease, CILCO –
    $21 million increase and IP – $84 million
    increase) based on an allowed return on equity of 10%. In
    December 2006, the ICC granted the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ petition for rehearing of the November 2006
    order on the recovery of certain administrative and general
    expenses, totaling approximately $50 million, that were
    disallowed. Because of the ICC’s cost disallowances and
    regulatory lag, the Ameren Illinois Utilities are not expected
    to earn their allowed return on equity in 2007. Prior to
    January 2, 2007, most customers were taking service under a
    frozen bundled electric rate in 2006, which included the cost of
    power, so any delivery service revenue changes will not directly
    correspond to a change in CIPS’, CILCO’s or IP’s
    revenues or earnings under the new electric delivery service
    rates. The necessity and timing of new Illinois delivery service
    rate cases for the Ameren Illinois Utilities will be driven by
    several factors, including the results of the pending rehearing.

•

Average residential electric rates for CIPS, CILCO and IP
    increased significantly following the expiration of a rate
    freeze at the end of 2006. Electric rates rose because of the
    increased cost of power purchased on behalf of Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ customers based on the results of the Illinois
    power procurement auction held in early September 2006 and
    increases resulting from the delivery service rate cases. CIPS
    and IP average residential rates are expected to increase in
    2007 by approximately 40% over 2006 rates, and CILCO average
    residential rates are expected to increase approximately 55%
    over 2006 rates. Due to the magnitude of these increases,
    certain Illinois legislators, the Illinois attorney general, the
    Illinois governor and other parties sought to block the power
    procurement auction. They continue to challenge the auction and
    the structure for the recovery of costs for power supply
    resulting from the auction through rates to customers. CIPS,
    CILCO and IP have received favorable rulings from the ICC and
    the circuit court of Cook County, Illinois on opposition claims
    filed by the Illinois attorney general, CUB and ELPC. These
    rulings are currently under court appeals.

•

On October 2, 2006, Speaker of the Illinois House of
    Representatives Michael Madigan sent a letter to Illinois
    Governor Rod Blagojevich asking the Illinois governor to call a
    special session of the Illinois General Assembly to consider
    legislation to freeze electric rates at 2006 levels. The
    governor sent a letter indicating that once the votes to pass
    the legislation were in place, he would immediately call for a
    special session of the legislature. The governor’s letter
    further provided that if a consensus among members of the
    general assembly could not be reached in the near future, he
    would call a special session in that event as well. No special
    session was called. The governor’s letter stated that he
    continued to support legislation extending a rate freeze and
    would like to sign it into law as soon as possible. During the
    Illinois General Assembly’s session that ended in January
    2007, the Illinois House of Representatives passed legislation
    to freeze 2006 electric rates through 2010, and the Illinois
    Senate passed legislation containing a rate increase phase-in
    plan. The Illinois Senate bill provided for a mandatory phase-in
    of the 2007 increase in residential rates over a three-year
    period. Neither piece of legislation was passed by the other
    chamber before the session ended in early January 2007. Any
    legislative measure will need to be approved by the Illinois
    House of Representatives and Illinois Senate, and signed by the
    governor before it can become law. A new Illinois General
    Assembly went into session in late January 2007. As a result,
    all previous bills expired. New bills have been introduced
    during the current legislative session, including legislation to
    rollback rates to 2006 levels similar to previously proposed
    legislation.



•

CIPS, CILCO and IP believe that legislation freezing electric
    rates at 2006 levels, if enacted, would have a material adverse
    effect on the results of operations, financial position, and
    liquidity, including the financial insolvency of CIPS, CILCORP,
    CILCO and IP. They believe it could cause significant job losses
    and, without governmental intervention, significant disruptions
    in electric and gas service. Ameren’s Illinois utilities
    own no generation, so the companies must purchase power on the
    competitive market to meet their customers’ energy needs.
    If electric rates were frozen at 2006 levels, the major credit
    rating agencies have stated that the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ credit ratings would be downgraded to deep junk
    (or speculative) status. Such a downgrade of CILCO’s
    ratings would also result in a similar downgrade of
    CILCORP’s ratings.

•

With such credit ratings, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP would be
    faced with potential collateral and prepayment requirements for
    products and services, such as natural gas, and would run out of
    cash and available credit and be unable to borrow. We believe
    this would cause the Ameren Illinois Utilities to become
    financially insolvent. Any decision or action that impairs the
    ability of CIPS, CILCO, and IP to fully recover costs from their
    electric customers in a timely manner would result in material
    adverse consequences for Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP.
    CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP expect to take whatever actions are
    necessary to protect their financial interests, including
    seeking the protection of the bankruptcy courts.

•

In December 2006, the ICC approved a constructive electric rate
    increase phase-in plan proposed by the Ameren Illinois Utilities
    for residential customers, eligible schools, local governments
    and small commercial customers, to address the significant
    increases in customer rates for the Ameren Illinois Utilities
    beginning in 2007. This optional plan limits annual rate
    increases to 14% in 2007, 2008, and 2009, with amounts in excess
    of the cap and a 3.25% carrying cost allowed to be collected
    over a three-year period beginning in 2010. This below-market
    carrying cost charge will result in increased net borrowing and
    financing costs for the Ameren Illinois Utilities. On
    February 27, 2007, the Ameren Illinois Utilities announced
    that they intended to file an electric rate increase mitigation
    plan with the ICC. As part of the plan, which is subject to ICC
    approval, the Ameren Illinois Utilities would fund an
    approximate $20 million one-time reduction to active
    residential accounts that would appear on electric bills in
    March and April 2007. The rate mitigation plan is targeted to
    customers with high volume usage. As part of the filing, the
    carrying charge of 3.25% in the current ICC-approved phase-in
    plan would be eliminated. If approved by the ICC, the one-time
    credit for residential customers would result in a charge to
    Ameren’s earnings in 2007 of $20 million, or
    6 cents per share. In addition, eliminating the
    below-market interest rate on deferred amounts under the
    phase-in plan would increase financing costs for the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities during the deferral period. The actual cost
    to Ameren will depend on the level of participation in the
    phase-in plan. See Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory
    Matters to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of Illinois
    rate matters.

•

The Illinois General Assembly and the ICC may consider changes
    to the Illinois power procurement process in the future. The
    next Illinois power procurement auction for the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities is scheduled to take place in January 2008.

•

In July 2006, UE filed requests with the MoPSC for an increase
    in electric rates of $361 million and in natural gas
    delivery rates of $11 million. The MoPSC staff recommended
    in their testimony an electric rate reduction of
    $136 million to $168 million and a gas rate increase
    of $2 million to $3 million. Other stakeholders also
    made recommendations. A decision from the MoPSC is expected no
    later than June 2007. See Note 3 – Rate and
    Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further
    discussion of Missouri rate matters.

•

We expect continued economic growth in our service territory to
    benefit energy demand in 2007 and beyond, but higher energy
    prices could result in reduced demand from consumers, especially
    in Illinois.

•

UE, Genco and CILCO are seeking to raise the equivalent
    availability and capacity factors of their power plants through
    greater investments and a process improvement program and
    investment.

•

Very volatile power prices in the Midwest affect the amount of
    revenues Ameren, UE, Genco and CILCO (through AERG) can generate
    by marketing power into the wholesale and interchange markets
    and influence the cost of power we purchase in the interchange
    markets. These companies hedged approximately 86% of estimated
    available 2007 generation (2008 – 70%,
    2009 – 60%).

Fuel and
    Purchased Power

•

In 2006, 85% of Ameren’s electric generation
    (UE – 77%, Genco – 97%, CILCO –
    99%) was supplied by its coal-fired power plants. About 93% of
    the coal used by these plants (UE – 97%,
    Genco – 87%, CILCO – 69%) was delivered by
    railroads from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. In 2005,
    deliveries from the Powder River Basin were restricted due to
    derailments. As of December 31, 2006, coal inventories for
    UE, Genco and AERG were adequate, and consistent with historical
    levels. However, inventories and deliveries were still below
    desired levels because of railroad capacity limitations.
    Disruptions in coal deliveries could cause UE, Genco and CILCO
    to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power
    during low-margin periods, buying higher-cost fuels to generate
    required electricity, and purchasing power from other sources.

•

Ameren’s coal and related transportation costs are expected
    to increase 15% to 20% in 2007 and 5% to 10% in 2008.
    Ameren’s nuclear fuel costs are also expected to rise over
    the next few years. In 2007, nuclear fuel costs are expected to
    increase 13% to



18%. In addition, power generation from higher-cost gas-fired
    plants is expected to increase in the next few years. See
    Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures about Market Risk of this report for information
    about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements
    that are price-hedged for 2006 through 2010.

•

In Illinois, Ameren and IP will also experience higher

year-over-year

purchased power expenses as the amortization of certain
    favorable purchase accounting adjustments associated with the IP
    acquisition was completed in 2006.

•

In July 2005, a new law was enacted that enables the MoPSC to
    put in place fuel, purchased power, and environmental cost
    recovery mechanisms for Missouri’s utilities. The law also
    includes rate case filing requirements, a 2.5% annual rate
    increase cap for the environmental cost recovery mechanism, and
    prudency reviews, among other things. Rules for the fuel and
    purchased power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the
    MoPSC in September 2006. We are unable to predict when rules
    implementing the environmental cost recovery mechanism will be
    formally proposed and adopted. UE requested a fuel and purchased
    power cost recovery mechanism in its electric rate case filed
    with the MoPSC in July 2006. The MoPSC staff and intervenors in
    the electric rate case have recommended that UE not be granted
    the right to use such a mechanism. UE also requested an
    environmental cost recovery mechanism as part of its pending
    Missouri electric case, but no rules have been established for
    such a mechanism. UE’s requests are subject to approval by
    the MoPSC.

•

In 2007, Ameren expects to reduce levels of emission allowance
    sales in order to retain remaining allowances for future
    environmental compliance needs.

Other
    Costs

•

In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at
    UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility. This
    resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which
    damaged a state park. Until reviews conducted by state
    authorities have concluded, litigation has been resolved, the
    insurance review is completed, a final decision about whether
    the plant will be rebuilt is made, and future regulatory
    treatment for the plant is determined, Taum Sauk will remain out
    of service. In February 2007, UE submitted plans and an
    environmental report to FERC to rebuild the upper reservoir at
    its Taum Sauk plant, assuming successful resolution of
    outstanding issues with authorities of the state of Missouri.
    Should the decision be made to rebuild the Taum Sauk plant, UE
    would expect it to be out of service through at least the middle
    of 2009, if not longer. UE has accepted responsibility for the
    effects of the incident. At this time, UE believes that
    substantially all of the damage and liabilities (but not
    penalties) caused by the breach, including rebuilding the plant,
    will be covered by insurance. UE expects the total cost for
    clean up, damage and liabilities, excluding costs to rebuild the
    facility, resulting from the Taum Sauk incident to range from
    $131 million to $151 million. As of December 31,
    2006, UE had paid $65 million and accrued a
    $66 million liability, including costs resulting from the
    FERC stipulation and consent agreement, while expensing
    $30 million, and recording a $101 million receivable
    due from insurance companies. As of December 31, 2006, UE
    had received $16 million from insurance companies reducing
    the insurance receivable to $85 million. As of
    December 31, 2006, UE had a $10 million receivable due
    from insurance companies related to rebuilding the facility.
    Under UE’s insurance policies, all claims by or against UE
    are subject to review by its insurance carriers. As a result of
    this breach, UE is subject to litigation by private parties and
    by state authorities. We are unable to determine the impact the
    breach may have on Ameren’s and UE’s results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity beyond those
    amounts already recognized.

•

UE’s Callaway nuclear plant’s next scheduled refueling
    and maintenance outage in 2007 is expected to last 30 to
    35 days. During an outage, which occurs every
    18 months, maintenance and purchased power costs increase,
    and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases,
    versus non-outage years.

•

Over the next few years, we except rising employee benefit costs
    as well as higher insurance and security costs associated with
    additional measures we have taken, or may need to take, at
    UE’s Callaway nuclear plant and at our other facilities.
    Insurance premiums may also increase as a result of the Taum
    Sauk incident, among other things.

•

Bad debts may increase due to rising electric rates.

•

We are currently undertaking cost reduction and control
    initiatives associated with the strategic sourcing of purchases
    and streamlining of all aspects of our business.

Capital
    Expenditures

•

The EPA has issued more stringent emission limits on all
    coal-fired power plants. Between 2007 and 2016, Ameren expects
    that certain Ameren Companies will be required to invest between
    $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion to retrofit their power
    plants with pollution control equipment. These investments will
    also result in significantly higher ongoing operating expenses.
    Approximately 50% of this investment will be in Ameren’s
    regulated UE operations, and it is therefore expected to be
    recoverable from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts
    expended in non-rate-regulated operations will depend on whether
    market prices for power adjust as a result of this increased
    investment.

•

Ameren will provide a report on how it is responding to rising
    regulatory, competitive, and public pressure to significantly
    reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions from current and
    proposed power plant operations. The report will include
    Ameren’s climate change strategy and activities, current
    greenhouse gas emissions, and analysis with respect to plausible
    future greenhouse gas



scenarios. Ameren will publish this report on its Web site by
    September 1, 2007. Investments to control carbon emissions
    at Ameren’s coal-fired plants would significantly increase
    future capital expenditures.

•

UE continues to evaluate its longer-term needs for new baseload
    and peaking electric generation capacity. At this time, UE does
    not expect to require new baseload generation capacity until at
    least 2018. However, due to the significant time required to
    plan, acquire permits for and build a baseload power plant, UE
    is actively studying future plant alternatives, including those
    that would use coal or nuclear power.

•

Over the next few years, we expect to make significant
    investments in our electric and gas infrastructure to improve
    overall system reliability in addition to addressing
    environmental compliance requirements. We are projecting higher
    labor and material costs for these capital expenditures.

Other

•

Severe storms in 2006 and early 2007 resulted in electric
    outages for more than 1.5 million customers and an
    increased focus on alternatives for improving reliability during
    severe storms. UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s
    performance during these storms is subject to regulatory and
    legislative review and media attention. Recommendations to
    improve service during severe storms resulting from regulatory
    and internal reviews could include more aggressive tree removal
    and trimming programs, comprehensive pole and line inspections
    and burial of more electric services, among other things. Any
    additional costs or investments would be expected to be
    recovered in rates.

•

In 2006, Ameren realized gains on sales of noncore properties,
    including leveraged leases. The net benefit of these sales to
    Ameren in 2006 was 16 cents per share. Ameren continues to
    pursue the sale of its interests in its remaining three
    leveraged lease assets. Ameren does not expect to achieve
    similar sales levels of noncore properties in 2007.

Affiliate
    Transactions

•

As a result of the termination of the JDA on December 31,
    2006, UE and Genco no longer have the obligation to provide
    power to each other. UE will be able to sell any excess power it
    has at market prices, which we believe will most likely be
    higher than it was paid by Genco. Genco will no longer receive
    the margins on sales that it made, which were fulfilled with
    power from UE. Ameren’s and UE’s earnings will be
    affected by the termination of the JDA when UE’s rates are
    adjusted by the MoPSC. UE’s requested electric rate
    increase filed in July 2006 is net of the decrease in its
    revenue requirement from increased margins expected to result
    from the termination of the JDA. See Note 3 —
    Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 14 — Related
    Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the effects of
    terminating the JDA.

The above items could have a material impact on our results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity. Additionally, in
    the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to
    enhance our results of operations, financial position, or
    liquidity. These strategies may include acquisitions,
    divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase
    revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase
    Ameren’s shareholder value. We are unable to predict which,
    if any, of these initiatives will be executed. The execution of
    these initiatives may have a material impact on our future
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

ACCOUNTING
    MATTERS

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures
    in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate
    technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of
    estimates. Our application of these policies involves judgments
    regarding many factors which in and of themselves could
    materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. We
    have outlined below the critical accounting policies that we
    believe are most difficult, subjective or complex. Any change in
    the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the
    following matters, among others, could have a material impact on
    future financial results.

Accounting
    Estimate

Uncertainties
    Affecting Application

Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost
    Recovery

All of the Ameren Companies,
    except Genco, defer costs as regulatory assets in accordance
    with SFAS No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain
    Types of Regulation,” and make investments that they assume
    will be collected in future rates.

•    Regulatory environment and external regulatory decisions and requirements

•    Anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact

•    Impact of deregulation, rate freezes, and competition on ratemaking process and ability to recover costs

Basis for Judgment

We determine which costs are
    recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory
    authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors
    that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. If facts
    and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory
    asset is probably no longer recoverable, we record a charge to
    earnings, which could be material. See Note 3 – Rate
    and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8 of this report for quantification of
    these assets by registrant.

Environmental Costs

We accrue for all known
    environmental contamination where remediation can be reasonably
    estimated, but some of our operations have existed for over
    100 years and previous contamination may be unknown to us.

•    Extent of contamination

•    Responsible party determination

•    Approved methods for cleanup

•    Present and future legislation and governmental regulations and standards

•    Results of ongoing research and development regarding environmental impacts

Basis for Judgment

We determine the proper amounts to
    accrue for known environmental contamination by using internal
    and third-party estimates of cleanup costs in the context of
    current remediation standards and available technology. See
    Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report for disclosure on quantified environmental costs, to the
    extent possible.

Unbilled Revenue

At the end of each period, we
    project expected usage, and we estimate the amount of revenue to
    record for services that have been provided to customers but not
    yet billed.

•    Projecting customer energy usage

•    Estimating impacts of weather and other usage-affecting factors for the unbilled period

•    Estimating loss of energy during transmission and delivery



Accounting
    Estimate

Uncertainties
    Affecting Application

Basis for Judgment

We base our estimate of unbilled
    revenue each period on the volume of energy delivered, as valued
    by a model of billing cycles and historical usage rates and
    growth by customer class for our service area. This figure is
    then adjusted for the modeled impact of seasonal and weather
    variations based on historical results. See balance sheets under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report for unbilled revenue
    amounts for each registrant.

Valuation of Goodwill,
    Long-Lived Assets, and Asset Retirement Obligations

We assess the carrying value of
    our goodwill and long-lived assets to determine whether they are
    impaired. We also review for the existence of asset retirement
    obligations. If an asset retirement obligation is identified, we
    determine its fair value and subsequently reassess and adjust
    the obligation, as necessary.

•    Management’s identification of impairment indicators

•    Changes in business, industry, laws, technology, or economic and market conditions

•    Valuation assumptions and conclusions

•    Estimated useful lives of our significant long-lived assets

•    Actions or assessments by our regulators

•    Identification of an asset retirement obligation

Basis for Judgment

Annually, or whenever events
    indicate a valuation may have changed, we use internal models
    and third parties to determine fair values. We use various
    methods to determine valuations, including earnings before
    interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples, and
    discounted, undiscounted, and probabilistic discounted cash flow
    models with multiple scenarios. The identification of asset
    retirement obligations is conducted through the review of legal
    documents and interviews. See Note 1 – Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements
    under Part II, Item 8, of this report for
    quantification of our goodwill assets.

Benefit Plan
    Accounting

Based on actuarial calculations,
    we accrue costs of providing future employee benefits in
    accordance with SFAS Nos. 87, 106, 112 and 158, which
    provide guidance on benefit plan accounting. See
    Note 10 –  Retirement Benefits to our financial
    statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

•    Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets

•    Interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations

•    Health care cost trend rates

•    Timing of employee retirements and mortality assumptions

Basis for Judgment

We use a third-party consultant to
    assist us in evaluating and recording the proper amount for
    future employee benefits. Our ultimate selection of the discount
    rate, health care trend rate, and expected rate of return on
    pension assets is based on our review of available historical,
    current, and projected rates, as applicable. See
    Note 10 – Retirement Benefits to our financial
    statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for
    sensitivity of Ameren’s benefit plans to potential changes
    in these assumptions.

    Policies to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report.

EFFECTS OF
    INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

Our rates for retail electric and gas utility service are
    regulated by the MoPSC and the ICC. Nonretail electric rates are
    regulated by FERC. Our Missouri retail electric rates and gas
    delivery rates were set through June 30, 2006, as part of
    the settlement of Missouri electric and gas rate cases. In July
    2006, UE filed a request with the MoPSC for an increase in base
    rates for electric service and in natural gas delivery rates. A
    decision from the MoPSC is expected no later than June 2007. Our
    Illinois electric rates were legislatively fixed through
    January 1, 2007. Even without these rate moratoriums,
    adjustments to rates are based on a regulatory process that
    reviews a historical period. As a result, revenue increases will
    lag behind changing prices. Inflation affects our operations,
    earnings, stockholders’ equity, and financial performance.



The current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially
    exceeds our recorded historical cost. Under existing regulatory
    practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from
    customers. As a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery
    of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate
    to replace the plant in future years. The generation portion of
    our business in Illinois is non-rate-regulated and therefore
    does not have regulated recovery mechanisms.

In UE’s Missouri electric utility jurisdiction, there is
    currently no tariff for adjusting rates to accommodate changes
    in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of
    purchased power. However, in July 2005, a new law was enacted
    that enables the MoPSC to put in place fuel, purchased power,
    and environmental cost recovery mechanisms for Missouri’s
    utilities. Rules for the fuel and purchased power cost recovery
    mechanism were approved by the MoPSC in September 2006. UE
    requested a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism in
    its electric rate case filed with the MoPSC in July 2006. UE
    also requested an environmental cost recovery mechanism as part
    of its pending Missouri electric case, but rules have not been
    established for such a mechanism. UE’s requests are subject
    to approval by the MoPSC. Effective January 2, 2007,
    ICC-approved tariffs in Illinois allow CIPS, CILCO and IP to
    recover power supply costs by adjusting rates to accommodate
    changes in power prices. See Note 3 – Rate and
    Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on
    legislative and other efforts to limit full recovery of power
    costs in Illinois. In our Missouri and Illinois retail gas
    utility jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally
    reflected in billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. UE,
    Genco, CILCORP and AERG are affected by changes in market prices
    for natural gas to the extent that they must purchase natural
    gas to run CTs. These companies have structured various supply
    agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply
    basins, and to minimize the impact to their financial
    statements. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
    Market Risk – Commodity Price Risk under Part II,
    Item 7A, of this report for further information.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset
    or a financial instrument, derivative or nonderivative, caused
    by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates,
    commodity prices and equity security prices. A derivative is a
    contract whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value
    of some underlying asset. The following discussion of our risk
    management activities includes forward-looking statements that
    involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ
    materially from those projected in the forward-looking
    statements. We handle market risks in accordance with
    established policies, which may include entering into various
    derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we
    also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable.
    Such risks, principally business, legal and operational risks,
    are not part of the following discussion.

Our risk management objective is to optimize our physical
    generating assets within prudent risk parameters. Our risk
    management policies are set by a risk management steering
    committee, which is composed of senior-level Ameren
    officers.

Interest Rate
    Risk

We are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates
    associated with:

•

long-term and short-term variable-rate debt;

•

fixed-rate debt;

•

commercial paper; and

•

auction-rate long-term debt.

We manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount
    of these instruments we hold within our total capitalization
    portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in
    interest rates.

The following table presents the estimated increase in our
    annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest
    rates were to increase by 1% on variable-rate debt outstanding
    at December 31, 2006:

The estimated changes above do not consider potential reduced
    overall economic activity that would exist in such an
    environment. In the event of a significant change in interest
    rates, management would probably act to further mitigate our
    exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of
    the specific actions that would be taken and their possible
    effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our
    financial structure.

Credit
    Risk

Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if
    counterparties fail to perform as contracted.

NYMEX-traded

futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit
    quality of the clearing members of the NYMEX and have nominal
    credit risk. In all other transactions, we are exposed to credit
    risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the
    transaction.

Our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit
    risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and



executory contracts with market risk exposures. The risk
    associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large
    number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make
    up our customer base. At December 31, 2006, no
    nonaffiliated customer represented more than 10%, in the
    aggregate, of our accounts receivable. Our revenues are
    primarily derived from sales of electricity and natural gas to
    customers in Missouri and Illinois. UE, CIPS, Genco, AERG, IP,
    AFS and Marketing Company may have credit exposure associated
    with interchange purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated
    companies. At December 31, 2006, UE’s, CIPS’,
    Genco’s, AERG’s, IP’s, AFS’ and Marketing
    Company’s combined credit exposure to non-investment-grade
    counterparties related to interchange purchases and sales was
    less than $1 million, net of collateral (2005 –
    $39 million). We establish credit limits for these
    counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits
    on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program
    that involves daily exposure reporting to senior management,
    master trading and netting agreements, and credit support, such
    as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also analyze
    each counterparty’s financial condition before we enter
    into sales, forwards, swaps, futures or option contracts, and we
    monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged
    leases. We estimate our credit exposure to MISO associated with
    the MISO Day Two Energy Market to be $35 million at
    December 31, 2006 (2005 – $26 million).

Equity Price
    Risk

Our costs of providing defined benefit retirement and
    postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of
    factors, including the rate of return on plan assets. Ameren
    manages plan assets in accordance with the “prudent
    investor” guidelines contained in ERISA. Ameren’s goal
    is to earn the highest possible return on plan assets consistent
    with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates investment
    management to specialists in each asset class. Where
    appropriate, Ameren provides the investment manager with
    guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment
    types. Ameren regularly monitors manager performance and
    compliance with investment guidelines.

The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and
    projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes
    in the investment portfolio. Assumed projected rates of return
    for each asset class were selected after an analysis of
    historical experience, future expectations, and the volatility
    of the various asset classes. After considering the target asset
    allocation for each asset class, we adjusted the overall
    expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and
    expected experience of active portfolio management results
    compared with benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses
    paid from plan assets.

In future years, the costs of such plans reflected in net income
    or OCI and cash contributions to the plans could increase
    materially, without pension asset portfolio investment returns
    equal to or in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of
    8.5%.

UE also maintains a trust fund, as required by the NRC and
    Missouri law, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant
    decommissioning. As of December 31, 2006, this fund was
    invested primarily in domestic equity securities (67%) and debt
    securities (32%) and totaled $285 million (2005 –
    $250 million). By maintaining a portfolio that includes
    long-term equity investments, UE seeks to maximize the returns
    to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within
    acceptable parameters of risk. However, the equity securities
    included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in
    equity markets. The fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are
    exposed to changes in interest rates. UE actively monitors the
    portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments
    against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically
    reviewing established target allocation percentages of the
    assets of the trust to various investment options. UE’s
    exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated,
    because UE is currently allowed to recover decommissioning
    costs, which would include unfavorable investment results,
    through electric rates.

Commodity Price
    Risk

We are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity,
    fuel, and natural gas. UE’s, Genco’s, AERG’s and
    EEI’s risks of changes in prices for power sales are
    partially hedged through sales agreements. Genco, AERG and EEI
    also seek to sell power forward to wholesale, municipal and
    industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices. We
    also attempt to mitigate financial risks through structured risk
    management programs and policies, which include structured
    forward-hedging programs, and the use of derivative financial
    instruments (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts,
    option contracts, and financial swap contracts). However, a
    portion of the generation capacity of UE, Genco, AERG and EEI is
    not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements
    and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices.

Similar techniques are used to manage risks associated with fuel
    exposures for generation. Most UE, Genco and AERG fuel supply
    contracts are physical forward contracts. UE, Genco and AERG do
    not have a provision similar to the PGA clause for electric
    operations, so UE, Genco and AERG have entered into long-term
    contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal and nuclear
    fuel to manage their exposure to fuel prices. The coal hedging
    strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while
    reducing exposure to commodity price volatility. Price and
    volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through
    periodic bid procedures, whereby the amount of coal purchased is
    determined by the current market prices and the minimum and
    maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year. We
    generally purchase coal up to five years in advance, but we may
    purchase coal beyond five years to take advantage of favorable
    deals or market conditions. The strategy also allows for the
    decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market
    conditions. As part of its pending electric



rate case filed in July 2006, UE has requested approval by the
    MoPSC for a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism to
    its tariffs.

Transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a
    significant portion of fuel costs. We typically hedge coal
    transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to
    mitigate transportation price volatility. The natural gas
    transportation expenses for the distribution utility companies
    and the gas-fired generation units are controlled by FERC via
    published tariffs with rights to extend the contracts from year
    to year. Depending on our competitive position, we are able in
    some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariffs for our
    requirements.

The following table shows how our total fuel expense might
    increase and how our net income might decrease if coal and coal
    transportation costs were to increase by 1% on any requirements
    not currently covered by fixed-price contracts for the five-year
    period 2007 through 2011:

In the event of a significant change in coal prices, UE, Genco
    and CILCO would probably take actions to further mitigate their
    exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of
    the specific actions that would be taken and their possible
    effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our
    financial structure or fuel sources.

With regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear
    fuel, UE has fixed-priced and base-price-with- escalation
    agreements, or it uses inventories that provide some price
    hedge. Fuel assemblies for the 2007 spring refueling are already
    at the Callaway nuclear plant. UE has price hedges for 61% of
    the 2008 to 2011 nuclear fuel requirements.

The nuclear fuel markets have undergone significant change; from
    a buyer’s market to a seller’s market with increased
    potential for supply disruptions. UE has increased its desired
    inventories of nuclear fuel (with inherent price hedge) and has
    increased its forward contract coverage. New long-term uranium
    contracts are almost exclusively market-price-related with an
    escalating price floor. New long-term enrichment contracts
    usually have some market-price-related component. Therefore,
    nuclear fuel price increases are expected and price hedging
    becomes less available. UE expects to enter into additional
    contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel
    during the expected life of the Callaway nuclear plant, at
    prices which cannot now be accurately predicted. Unlike the
    electricity and natural gas markets, nuclear fuel markets have
    no sophisticated financial instruments available for price
    hedging, so most hedging is done through inventories and forward
    contracts, if available.

With regard to the electric generating operations for UE, Genco
    and AERG that are exposed to changes in market prices for
    natural gas used to run the CTs, the natural gas procurement
    strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery
    of natural gas while minimizing costs. We optimize
    transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring
    supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and
    supply basins.

Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO
    and IP have been granted FTRs associated with the advent of the
    MISO Day Two Energy Market. Marketing Company has acquired FTRs
    for its participation in the PJM-Northern Illinois market. The
    FTRs are intended to mitigate expected electric transmission
    congestion charges related to our physical electricity business.
    Depending on the congestion and prices at various points on the
    electric transmission grid, FTRs could result in either charges
    or credits. We use complex grid modeling tools to determine
    which FTRs we wish to nominate in the FTR allocation process.
    There is a risk that we may incorrectly model the amount of FTRs
    we will need, and there is the potential that the FTRs could be
    ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges.

With regard to UE’s natural gas distribution business and
    CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s power and natural gas
    distribution businesses, exposure to changing market prices is
    in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery
    mechanisms in place. These cost recovery mechanisms allow UE,
    CIPS, CILCO and IP to pass on to retail customers prudently
    incurred costs. Our strategy is designed to reduce the effect of
    market fluctuations for our regulated customers. We cannot
    eliminate the effects of price volatility. However, procurement
    strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments
    similar to those outlined earlier, as well as the management of
    physical assets.

With regard to our exposure for commodity price risk for
    construction and maintenance activities, Ameren is exposed to
    changes in market prices for metal commodities and labor
    availability.



The following table presents the percentages of the projected
    required supply of coal and coal transportation for our
    coal-fired power plants, nuclear fuel for UE’s Callaway
    nuclear plant, natural gas for our CTs and retail distribution,
    as appropriate, and purchased power needs of CIPS, CILCO and IP,
    which own no generation, that are price-hedged over the
    five-year period 2007 through 2011:

    purchased power for fixed-price large commercial and industrial
    customers with 1 megawatt of demand or higher who had 30 to
    50 days after the date the auction was declared successful
    (September 15, 2006) to elect not to receive power
    from CIPS, CILCO or IP. The majority of these customers chose a
    third-party supplier. However, regardless of whether customers
    choose a third-party supplier, the purchased power needed to
    serve the remaining load is 100% price-hedged through
    May 31, 2008, due to the Illinois auction. Also excluded
    from the percent hedged amount is power purchased to serve
    large-service real-time pricing customers, as the auction
    results have not been finalized for this customer class.

    report for further information. See Supply for Electric Power
    under Part I, Item 1, of this report for the
    percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal, nuclear,
    natural gas, hydroelectric and oil. Also see
    Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report for further information.

Fair Value of
    Contracts

Most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal
    purchases and normal sales. We use derivatives principally to
    manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas,
    fuel, electricity and emission allowances.



Price fluctuations in natural gas, fuel and electricity may
    cause any of these conditions:

•

an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted
    commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sales prices
    under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices;

•

market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased
    power that differ from the cost of those commodities in
    inventory under contracted commitment; or

•

actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that
    differ from anticipated cash outlays.

The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by
    our risk management policies for forward contracts, futures,
    options and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed
    within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new
    or offsetting transactions are required. The goal of the hedging
    program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring
    that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements.
    See Note 8 – Derivative Financial Instruments to
    our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for further information.

ITEM 8.
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Ameren Corporation:

We have completed integrated audits of Ameren Corporation’s
    consolidated financial statements and of its internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our
    audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Ameren
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. These financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for asset retirement costs as of December 31, 2005, and the
    manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and
    postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2006.

Internal control
    over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in
    Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
    those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
    Framework issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
    of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
    control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
    the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and



performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

of Union Electric Company:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Union Electric
    Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
    the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing
    under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein when read in
    conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
    These financial statements and financial statement schedule are
    the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
    We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
    the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
    assessing the accounting principles used and significant
    estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
    financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for asset retirement costs as of December 31, 2005, and the
    manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and
    postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2006.

NOTE 1 –
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public
    utility holding company under PUHCA 2005, administered by FERC.
    Ameren was registered with the SEC as a public utility holding
    company under PUHCA 1935 until that act was repealed, effective
    February 8, 2006. Ameren’s primary assets are the
    common stock of its subsidiaries. Ameren’s subsidiaries,
    which are separate, independent legal entities with separate
    businesses, assets and liabilities, operate rate-regulated
    electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses,
    rate-regulated natural gas transmission and distribution
    businesses, and non-rate-regulated electric generation
    businesses in Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Ameren’s
    common stock depend on distributions made to it by its
    subsidiaries. Ameren’s principal subsidiaries are listed
    below. Also see the Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations at the
    front of this report.

•

UE, or Union Electric Company, also known as AmerenUE, operates
    a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission and
    distribution business, and a rate-regulated natural gas
    transmission and distribution business in Missouri. Before
    May 2, 2005, it also operated those businesses in Illinois.
    UE was incorporated in Missouri in 1922 and is successor to a
    number of companies, the oldest of which was organized in 1881.
    It is the largest electric utility in the state of Missouri. It
    supplies electric and gas service to a

24,000-square-mile

area located in central and eastern Missouri. This area has an
    estimated population of 3 million and includes Greater St.
    Louis. UE supplies electric service to 1.2 million
    customers and natural gas service to 125,000 customers.

•

CIPS, or Central Illinois Public Service Company, also known as
    AmerenCIPS, operates a rate-regulated electric and natural gas
    transmission and distribution business in Illinois. CIPS was
    incorporated in Illinois in 1902. It supplies electric and gas
    utility service to portions of central, west central and
    southern Illinois having an estimated population of
    1 million in an area of 20,500 square miles. CIPS
    supplies electric service to 400,000 customers and natural gas
    service to 190,000 customers.

•

Genco, or Ameren Energy Generating Company, operates a
    non-rate-regulated electric generation business in Illinois and
    Missouri. Genco was incorporated in Illinois in March 2000, in
    conjunction with the Illinois Customer Choice Law. Genco
    commenced operations on May 1, 2000, when CIPS transferred
    its five coal-fired power plants representing in the aggregate
    about 2,860 megawatts of capacity and related liabilities to
    Genco at historical net book value. The transfer was made in
    exchange for a subordinated promissory note from Genco in the
    amount of $552 million and shares of Genco’s common
    stock that were subsequently distributed to Ameren as a dividend
    in kind. Ameren then contributed the shares to Development
    Company as an additional capital contribution. Genco also owns
    17 CTs, which gave it a total installed generating capacity of
    about 4,222 megawatts as of December 31, 2006. Genco is a
    subsidiary of Development Company, a subsidiary of Resources
    Company, which in turn is a subsidiary of Ameren.

•

CILCO, or Central Illinois Light Company, also known as
    AmerenCILCO, is a subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company). It
    operates a rate-regulated electric transmission and distribution
    business, a non-rate-regulated electric generation business, and
    a rate-regulated natural gas transmission and distribution
    business in Illinois. CILCO was incorporated in Illinois in
    1913. It supplies electric and gas utility service to portions
    of central and east central Illinois in areas of 3,700 and
    4,500 square miles, respectively, with an estimated
    population of 1 million. CILCO supplies electric service to
    215,000 customers and natural gas service to 220,000 customers.
    In October 2003, CILCO transferred its coal-fired plants and a
    CT facility, representing in the aggregate about 1,100 megawatts
    of electric generating capacity, to a wholly owned subsidiary
    known as AERG, as a contribution in respect of all the
    outstanding stock of AERG and AERG’s assumption of certain
    liabilities. The net book value of the transferred assets was
    $378 million. In December 2006, CILCO transferred to AERG
    its cogeneration facility and oil-fired diesel generator, which
    represent in the aggregate about 23 megawatts of electric
    generating capacity. The net book value of the transferred
    assets was $20 million. No gain or loss was recognized on
    the transfers, as the transactions were accounted for as
    transfers between entities under common control. The transfers
    were made in conjunction with the Illinois Customer Choice Law.
    CILCORP was incorporated in Illinois in 1985.

•

IP, or Illinois Power Company, also known as AmerenIP, operates
    a rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and
    distribution business in Illinois. Ameren acquired IP on
    September 30, 2004, from Dynegy, which had acquired it with
    Illinova in early 2000. IP was incorporated in 1923 in Illinois.
    It supplies electric and gas utility service to portions of
    central, east central, and southern Illinois, serving a
    population of 1.4 million in an area of 15,000 square
    miles, contiguous to our other service territories. IP supplies
    electric service to 635,000 customers and natural gas service to
    430,000 customers, including most of the



Illinois portion of the Greater St. Louis area. See
    Note 2 – Acquisitions for further information.

Ameren has various other subsidiaries responsible for the short-
    and long-term marketing of power, procurement of fuel,
    management of commodity risks, and provision of other shared
    services. Ameren has an 80% ownership interest in EEI through UE
    and Development Company, which each own 40% of EEI. Ameren
    consolidates EEI for financial reporting purposes, while UE
    reports EEI under the equity method. The following table
    presents summarized financial information of EEI (in millions).

The financial statements of the Ameren Companies (except CIPS)
    are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the
    accounts of their majority-owned subsidiaries as applicable. As
    the acquisition of IP occurred on September 30, 2004,
    Ameren’s Consolidated Statements of Income, Cash Flows, and
    Stockholders’ Equity for the periods prior to
    September 30, 2004, do not reflect IP’s results of
    operations. See Note 2 – Acquisitions for further
    information about the accounting for the IP acquisition. All
    significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All
    tabular dollar amounts are in millions, unless otherwise
    indicated.

Our accounting policies conform to GAAP. Our financial
    statements reflect all adjustments (which include normal,
    recurring adjustments) necessary, in our opinion, for a fair
    presentation of our results. The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and
    assumptions affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates
    of financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates. Certain reclassifications have been
    made to make prior-year financial statements conform to 2006
    reporting, including the reclassification of emission allowance
    purchases and sales from Operating Activities to Investing
    Activities on the Statements of Cash Flows for Ameren, UE,
    Genco, CILCORP and CILCO. In the third quarter of 2006, Ameren,
    UE, CILCORP and CILCO changed their reportable segments. See
    further discussion in Note 17 – Segment
    Information.

As part of the acquisition of IP on September 30, 2004,
    Ameren “pushed down” the effects of purchase
    accounting to the financial statements of IP. Accordingly,
    IP’s postacquisition financial statements reflect a new
    basis of accounting, and separate financial statement amounts
    are presented for preacquisition (predecessor) and
    postacquisition (successor) periods, separated by a bold black
    line. As a result of the acquisition of IP, certain
    reclassifications have been made to make IP prior-year financial
    statements conform to our current presentation.

Regulation

Certain Ameren subsidiaries are regulated by the MoPSC, the ICC,
    the NRC, and FERC. In accordance with SFAS No. 71,
    “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
    Regulation,” UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP defer certain costs
    pursuant to actions of our rate regulators. These companies are
    currently recovering such costs in rates charged to customers.
    See Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters for
    further information.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and temporary
    investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
    or less.

Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts Receivable

The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the
    amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts
    receivable. The allowance is based on the application of a
    historical write-off factor to the amount  of outstanding
    receivables, including unbilled revenue, and a review for
    collectibility of certain accounts over 90 days past due.



Materials and
    Supplies

Materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost or
    market. Cost is determined using the average cost method.
    Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then
    expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
    installed. The following table presents a breakdown of materials
    and supplies for each of the Ameren Companies at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005:

    propane, and tire chips.

Property and
    Plant

We capitalize the cost of additions to and betterments of units
    of property and plant. The cost includes labor, material,
    applicable taxes, and overhead. An allowance for funds used
    during construction, or the cost of borrowed funds and the cost
    of equity funds (preferred and common stockholders’ equity)
    applicable to rate-regulated construction expenditures, is also
    added for our rate-regulated assets. Interest during
    construction is added for non-rate-regulated assets. Maintenance
    expenditures are expensed as incurred. When units of depreciable
    property are retired, the original costs, less salvage value,
    are charged to accumulated depreciation. Asset removal costs
    incurred by our non-rate-regulated operations, that do not
    constitute legal obligations are expensed as incurred. Asset
    removal costs accrued by our rate-regulated operations, that do
    not constitute legal obligations are classified as a regulatory
    liability. See Accounting Changes and Other Matters relating to
    SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 below and
    Note 4 – Property and Plant, Net for further
    information.

Depreciation

Depreciation is provided over the estimated lives of the various
    classes of depreciable property by applying composite rates on a
    straight-line basis. The provision for depreciation for the
    Ameren Companies in 2006, 2005 and 2004 generally ranged from 3%
    to 4% of the average depreciable cost. See Accounting Changes
    and Other Matters relating to SFAS No. 143 and
    FIN 47 below for further information.

Allowance for
    Funds Used During Construction

In our rate-regulated operations, we capitalize the allowance
    for funds used during construction, as is the utility industry
    accounting practice. Allowance for funds used during
    construction does not represent a current source of cash funds.
    This accounting practice offsets the effect on earnings of the
    cost of financing current construction, and it treats such
    financing costs in the same manner as construction charges for
    labor and materials.

Under accepted ratemaking practice, cash recovery of allowance
    for funds used during construction and for other construction
    costs occurs when completed projects are placed in service and
    reflected in customer rates. The following table presents the
    allowance for funds used during construction rates that were
    utilized during 2006, 2005 and 2004:

Goodwill and
    Intangible Assets

Goodwill.

As of December 31, 2006, Ameren, CILCORP
    and IP had goodwill of $830 million, $542 million and
    $213 million, respectively. Goodwill represents the excess
    of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of
    the net assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment in
    the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events
    and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
    Ameren’s and IP’s goodwill relates to the acquisitions
    of IP and an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI in 2004,
    and Ameren’s and CILCORP’s goodwill relates to the
    acquisitions of CILCORP and Medina Valley in 2003.

As a result of the ICC electric delivery service rate case
    orders effective January 2, 2007, discussed in
    Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Ameren,
    CILCORP and IP concluded in the fourth quarter of 2006 that
    amounts previously recorded as goodwill in connection with
    Ameren’s acquisitions of IP and CILCORP related to pension
    and other postretirement benefit purchase accounting adjustments



were now probable of recovery following the guidance of SFAS
    No. 71 as amended by SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations.” Accordingly, at December 31, 2006,
    $54 million for CILCORP and $186 million for IP were
    reclassified from goodwill to regulatory assets and deferred
    income taxes of $21 million for CILCORP and
    $73 million for IP were recorded, reducing goodwill by
    $146 million, as shown in the table below. These regulatory
    assets will be amortized to earnings as the amounts are
    collected from IP and CILCO ratepayers. This reclassification
    had no impact to CILCO’s balance sheet as Ameren’s
    purchase accounting for the CILCORP acquisition was not
    “pushed down” to the CILCO financial statements.

In December 2006, Ameren adopted SFAS No. 158. In
    accordance with that accounting standard, Ameren recorded the
    unfunded obligation of its defined benefit and postretirement
    benefit plans. The unfunded obligation is the difference between
    the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans or
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for postretirement
    benefit plans and each plan’s assets. For Ameren, the
    unfunded obligation at December 31, 2006, was approximately
    $1.1 billion. Ameren’s adoption of SFAS No. 158
    resulted in increases (decreases) to Ameren’s, UE’s,
    CIPS’, Genco’s, CILCORP’s, CILCO’s and
    IP’s accrued pension and other postretirement benefits of
    approximately $406 million, $234 million,
    $95 million, $36 million, ($51) million,
    $55 million and ($8) million, respectively. UE, CIPS
    and CILCO recorded regulatory assets of approximately
    $270 million, $108 million and $63 million,
    respectively, based on the expected recovery of these costs from
    ratepayers. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 resulted in an
    immaterial impact on accumulated other comprehensive income at
    Ameren. CILCORP and IP recognized gains in Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income of approximately $29 million and
    $5 million, respectively, net of taxes, as a result of SFAS
    No. 158 obligations being reduced from those previously
    recognized.

Genco and CILCO recorded a charge to Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income of approximately $24 million and
    $2 million, respectively, net of taxes.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the period
    from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006, were as

Impairment of
    Long-lived Assets

We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment when events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
    such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether
    impairment has occurred is made by comparing the estimated
    undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets with the
    carrying value of the assets. If impairment has occurred, we
    recognize the amount of the impairment by estimating the fair
    value of the assets and recording a provision for loss if the
    carrying value is greater than the fair value.

Investments

Ameren and UE evaluate for impairment the investments held in
    UE’s nuclear decommissioning trust fund. Investments are
    considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the
    cost basis is estimated to be other than temporary. If the
    decline is determined to be other than temporary, the cost basis
    of the security is written down to fair value. Losses on assets
    in the trust fund could result in higher funding requirements
    for decommissioning costs, which we believe would be recovered
    in electric rates paid by UE’s customers. Accordingly, any
    impairments would be recorded as regulatory assets on
    Ameren’s and UE’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Ameren
    and UE consider, among other factors, general market conditions,
    the duration and the extent to which the security’s fair
    value has been less than cost, and UE’s intent and ability
    to hold the investment. See Note 16 – Fair Value
    of Financial Instruments for disclosure of the fair value and
    unrealized gains and losses of UE’s investments.

Environmental
    Costs

Environmental costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and that the
    amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Estimated
    environmental expenditures are based on internal and third-party
    estimates, which are regularly reviewed and updated. Costs are
    expensed or deferred as a regulatory asset when it is expected
    that the costs will be recovered from customers in future rates.
    If environmental expenditures are related to facilities
    currently in use, such as pollution control equipment, the cost
    is capitalized and depreciated over the expected life of the
    asset.

Unamortized Debt
    Discount, Premium, and Expense

Discount, premium and expense associated with long-term debt are
    amortized over the lives of the related issues.

Revenue

Operating
    Revenues

UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP record operating revenue for
    electric or gas service when it is delivered to customers. We
    accrue an estimate of electric and gas revenues for service
    rendered, but unbilled, at the end of each accounting period.

Beginning in 2007 in CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s
    Illinois retail electric utility jurisdictions, changes in
    purchased power costs will be reflected in billings to electric
    customers through a charge for market-based power costs
    resulting from a competitive procurement process. See
    Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters for a
    discussion of the power procurement cost recovery mechanism.

See Note 13 – Related Party Transactions for
    further information on affiliate purchased power transactions.

Fuel and Gas
    Costs

In UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s Missouri
    and Illinois retail gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas
    costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers
    through PGA clauses.

UE’s cost of nuclear fuel is amortized to fuel expense on a

unit-of-production

basis. Spent fuel disposal cost is charged to expense based on
    net kilowatthours generated and sold.

Stock-based
    Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, Ameren adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) “Share-based
    Payment” (SFAS 123R), which revises SFAS 123 and
    supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees.” SFAS 123R requires companies to
    measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for
    an award of equity instruments by the grant-date fair value of
    the award. Ameren adopted SFAS 123R utilizing the modified
    prospective application. Under that approach, SFAS 123R
    applies to all awards granted or modified after the effective
    date. Ameren’s unearned compensation related to nonvested
    awards granted prior to its adoption of FAS 123R was
    eliminated against Ameren’s Other Paid-in Capital effective
    January 1, 2006, based on the guidance provided by
    SFAS 123R.

Had compensation cost for all stock options and restricted stock
    awards granted prior to 2003, when Ameren adopted SFAS 123,
    been determined on a fair value basis consistent with
    SFAS No. 123, Ameren’s net income would have been
    reduced by $1 million for the year ended December 31,
    2004; and, its pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share
    would have equaled actual earnings per share for the year ended
    December 31, 2004. Compensation cost for Ameren’s
    options granted prior to 2003 would have been fully recognized
    in 2004. Had compensation cost for all stock option awards
    granted prior to 2003 been determined on a fair value basis for
    Dynegy equity compensation in which IP employees participated,
    predecessor IP’s net income would have been reduced by
    $3 million for the nine months ended September 30,
    2004. On October 1, 2004, as a result of Ameren’s
    acquisition of IP, all unvested stock options granted to IP
    employees became null and void.

See Note 11 – Stock-based Compensation for
    further information.

Excise
    Taxes

Excise taxes reflected on Missouri electric, Missouri gas, and
    Illinois gas customer bills are imposed on us. They are recorded
    gross in Operating Revenues and Taxes Other than Income Taxes on
    the statement of income. Excise taxes reflected on Illinois
    electric customer bills are imposed on the consumer and are
    therefore not included in revenues and expenses. They are
    recorded as tax collections payable and included in Taxes
    Accrued. The following table presents excise taxes recorded in
    Operating Revenues and Taxes Other than Income Taxes for the
    years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004:

Income
    Taxes

Ameren uses an asset and liability approach for its financial
    accounting and reporting of income taxes, in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 109 “Accounting for Income
    Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
    for transactions that are treated differently for financial
    reporting and tax return purposes. These deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are determined by statutory tax rates.



We recognize that regulators will probably reduce future
    revenues for deferred tax liabilities initially recorded at
    rates in excess of the current statutory rate. Therefore,
    reductions in the deferred tax liability, which were recorded
    due to decreases in the statutory rate, were credited to a
    regulatory liability. A regulatory asset has been established to
    recognize the probable future recovery in rates of future income
    taxes resulting principally from the reversal of allowance for
    funds used during construction, that is, equity and temporary
    differences related to property and plant acquired before 1976,
    that were unrecognized temporary differences prior to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 109.

Investment tax credits used on tax returns for prior years have
    been deferred for book purposes; they are being amortized over
    the useful lives of the related properties. Deferred income
    taxes were recorded on the temporary difference represented by
    the deferred investment tax credits and a corresponding
    regulatory liability. This recognizes the expected reduction in
    rate revenue for future lower income taxes associated with the
    amortization of the investment tax credits. See
    Note 12 – Income Taxes.

Minority Interest
    and Preferred Dividends of Subsidiaries

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    Ameren had minority interest expense related to EEI of
    $27 million, $3 million and $4 million,
    respectively, and preferred dividends of subsidiaries of
    $11 million, $13 million, and $11 million,
    respectively.

Earnings Per
    Share

There were no material differences between Ameren’s basic
    and diluted earnings per share amounts in 2006, 2005, and 2004
    due to an immaterial number of stock options, restricted stock
    shares, and performance share units outstanding. The assumed
    stock option conversions increased the number of shares
    outstanding in the diluted earnings per share calculation by
    38,438 shares in 2006, 65,917 shares in 2005, and
    196,709 shares in 2004.

Accounting
    Changes and Other Matters

FASB
    Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes (FIN 48)

FIN 48 establishes that the financial statement effects of
    a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return are
    to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more
    likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the
    position will be sustained upon examination. In addition,
    FIN 48 requires expanded disclosure with respect to the
    uncertainty in income taxes and is effective as of the beginning
    of our 2007 fiscal year. We are still in the process of
    determining the impact the adoption of FIN 48 will have on
    our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity;
    however, at this time, we do not expect the impact of the
    adoption to be material.

SFAS No. 157,
    Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, which
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 clarifies that fair value is a market-based
    measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions
    that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
    liability. This standard is effective as of the beginning of our
    2008 fiscal year. We are still determining the impact the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our results of
    operations, financial position, and liquidity, if any; however,
    at this time, we do not expect the impact to be material.

SFAS
    No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
    Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, which
    requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded
    positions of defined benefit postretirement plans, including
    pension plans, as an asset or liability in their balance sheets.
    Employers must recognize as a component of OCI, net of tax, the
    gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise
    during the period but are not recognized as components of net
    periodic benefit cost. SFAS No. 158 also requires
    additional disclosures in the notes to the financial statements.
    The recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158
    were effective for us as of December 31, 2006. To the
    extent we determined that it is probable that the liabilities
    associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 158 will be
    recoverable through rates charged by Ameren’s
    rate-regulated businesses (UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP), a regulatory
    asset was recorded. See Note 10 – Retirement
    Benefits for additional information on the impact of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 158 at December 31, 2006.

Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior-Year
    Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements (SAB 108)

In September 2006, the SEC staff issued SAB 108, which
    provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should
    quantify misstatements when evaluating the materiality of
    financial statement errors. SAB 108 requires public
    companies to use a dual approach to assess the quantitative
    effects of financial misstatements. The dual approach includes
    both an income statement-focused assessment and a balance
    sheet-focused assessment. SAB 108 also provides transition
    accounting and disclosure guidance for situations in which a
    material error existed in prior-period financial statements,
    allowing companies to restate prior-period financial statements
    or recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying
    SAB 108 through an adjustment to beginning retained
    earnings in the year of adoption. SAB 108 was effective as
    of December 31, 2006.

Prior to 2000, we concluded that UE’s unbilled revenue was
    understated and CIPS’ unbilled revenue was overstated by a
    similar amount. We previously concluded that these differences
    were immaterial to the financial statements of UE and CIPS for
    all years subsequent to 2000. In connection with our application
    of SAB 108, we recorded a decrease to CIPS’ unbilled
    revenue of $12 million as an adjustment to retained
    earnings. Additionally, we concluded the UE unbilled



revenue difference was immaterial to its 2006 financial
    statements, and accordingly we recorded an increase to UE’s
    unbilled revenue of $12 million in the fourth quarter of
    2006 as an increase in operating revenues. The adoption of
    SAB 108 had no impact on Ameren’s consolidated results
    of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

SFAS
    No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations and
    FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations

SFAS No. 143 requires us to record the estimated fair value
    of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
    long-lived assets in the period in which the liabilities are
    incurred and to capitalize a corresponding amount as part of the
    book value of the related long-lived asset. In subsequent
    periods, we are required to make adjustments in AROs based on
    changes in estimated fair value. Corresponding increases in
    asset book values are depreciated over the remaining useful life
    of the related asset. Uncertainties as to the probability,
    timing or amount of cash flows associated with AROs affect our
    estimates of fair value. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 143, UE
    recorded AROs related to its Callaway nuclear plant
    decommissioning costs and retirement costs for a river
    structure. Additionally, Genco recorded an ARO for the
    retirement costs for a power plant ash pond. CILCORP and CILCO
    recorded AROs related to AERG power plant ash ponds.

FIN 47 clarified that an entity must recognize a liability
    for the fair value of a conditional ARO when it is incurred if
    the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated.
    FIN 47 also specified the information an entity would need
    to reasonably estimate the fair value of an ARO. In 2005,
    Ameren, Genco, CILCORP, and CILCO recognized net aftertax losses
    of $22 million, $16 million, $2 million, and
    $2 million, respectively, for the cumulative effect of a
    change in accounting principle for FIN 47. Upon adoption of
    FIN 47, Ameren, UE, Genco, CILCORP, and CILCO recorded AROs
    for retirement costs associated with asbestos removal, ash
    ponds, and river structures. In addition, Ameren, UE, CIPS, and
    IP recorded AROs for the disposal of certain transformers.

Asset removal costs accrued by our rate-regulated operations,
    that do not constitute legal obligations are classified as a
    regulatory liability. See Note 3 – Rate and
    Regulatory Matters.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning
    and ending carrying amount of AROs for the years 2006 and 2005:

If FIN 47 had been in effect as of December 31, 2004,
    the pro forma asset retirement obligations would have been
    $518 million, $462 million, $2 million,
    $32 million, $12 million, $12 million and
    $2 million for Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and
    IP, respectively. If FIN 47 had been applied for the years
    ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, Ameren’s,
    Genco’s, CILCORP’s and CILCO’s net income would
    have been lower by $2 million, $1 million, less than
    $1 million, and less than $1 million, respectively, in
    each year. The FIN 47 application would have reduced
    Ameren’s basic and diluted earnings per share
    $0.01 per share in each of these two years. The adoption of
    FIN 47 did not have any income statement impact on UE,
    CIPS, or IP because a regulatory asset was recorded as an offset
    to the AROs and the related net capitalized asset retirement
    costs.

Variable-interest
    Entities

According to FIN 46R, “Variable-interest
    Entities,” an entity is considered a variable-interest
    entity (VIE) if it does not have sufficient equity to finance
    its activities without assistance from variable interest
    holders, or if its equity investors lack any of the following
    characteristics of a controlling financial interest: control
    through voting rights, the obligation to absorb expected losses,
    or the right to receive expected residual returns. We have
    determined that the following significant VIEs were held by the
    Ameren Companies at December 31, 2006:

•

Tolling agreement.

CILCO has a variable interest in
    Medina Valley through a tolling agreement to purchase steam,
    chilled water, and electricity. We have concluded



that CILCO is not the primary beneficiary of Medina Valley.
    Accordingly, CILCO does not consolidate Medina Valley. The
    maximum exposure to loss as a result of this variable interest
    in the tolling agreement is not material.

•

Leveraged lease and affordable housing partnership
    investments.

Ameren and UE have investments in leveraged
    lease and affordable housing partnership arrangements that are
    variable interests. We have concluded that Ameren and UE are not
    primary beneficiaries of any of the VIEs related to these
    investments. The maximum exposure to loss as a result of these
    variable interests is limited to the investments in these
    arrangements. At December 31, 2006, Ameren had a net
    investment in leveraged leases of $13 million. At
    December 31, 2006, Ameren and UE had investments in
    affordable housing partnerships of $21 million and
    $17 million, respectively.

•

IP SPT.

Ameren acquired a variable interest in IP SPT
    with the acquisition of IP on September 30, 2004. IP has a
    variable interest in IP SPT, which was established in 1998 to
    issue TFNs. IP has indemnified and is liable to IP SPT if IP
    does not bill the applicable charges to its customers on behalf
    of IP SPT or if it does not remit the collection to IP SPT;
    however, the note holders are considered the primary
    beneficiaries of this special-purpose trust. Accordingly, Ameren
    and IP do not consolidate IP SPT.

NOTE 2 –
    ACQUISITIONS

IP and
    EEI

On September 30, 2004, Ameren completed the acquisition of
    all the common stock and 662,924 shares of preferred stock
    of IP and an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI from
    subsidiaries of Dynegy. Ameren acquired IP to complement its
    existing Illinois gas and electric operations. With the
    acquisition, IP became an Ameren subsidiary operating as
    AmerenIP.

The total transaction value was $2.3 billion, including the
    assumption of $1.8 billion of IP debt and preferred stock.
    Cash consideration was $429 million, net of
    $51 million cash acquired, and included transaction costs.
    In addition, this transaction included a fixed-price capacity
    power supply agreement for IP’s annual purchase in 2005 and
    2006 of 2,800 megawatts of electricity from DYPM. This agreement
    met about 70% of IP’s electric customer requirements during
    2005 and 2006. The remaining 30% of IP’s power was supplied
    by other companies through contracts and open-market purchases.
    The fair value of IP’s power supply agreements, including
    the fixed-price capacity power supply agreement with DYPM
    recorded at the acquisition date, resulted in a net liability of
    $109 million, which was fully amortized by
    December 31, 2006. In addition, IP recorded a fair value
    adjustment, resulting in a net asset of $20 million, which
    was fully amortized by December 31, 2005, for IP’s
    power supply agreement with EEI that expired at the end of 2005.
    Ameren funded this acquisition with the issuance of new Ameren
    common stock. Ameren issued an aggregate of 30 million
    common shares in February 2004 and July 2004, which generated
    net proceeds of $1.3 billion. Proceeds from these issuances
    were used to finance the cash portion of the purchase price, to
    reduce IP debt assumed in this transaction, and to pay related
    premiums.

Ameren acquired IP for $355 million, including transaction
    costs, plus the assumption of $1.8 billion of IP debt and
    preferred stock. The excess of the purchase price for IP’s
    common stock and preferred stock over net assets acquired was
    allocated to goodwill in the amount of $326 million. The
    portion of the total transaction value attributable to
    Ameren’s acquisition of Dynegy’s 20% ownership
    interest in EEI now held by Development Company was
    $125 million. The excess of purchase price over fair value
    was allocated to goodwill in the amount of $65 million in
    addition to specifically identifiable intangible assets of
    $48 million comprising emission allowances, which are
    amortized as they are used.

CT Facilities
    Purchases

In March 2006, following the receipt of all required regulatory
    approvals, UE completed the purchase of a 640-megawatt CT
    facility located in Audrain County, Missouri, at a price of
    $115 million from NRG Audrain Holding, LLC, and NRG Audrain
    Generating LLC, affiliates of NRG Energy, Inc. (collectively,
    NRG). As a part of this transaction, UE was assigned the rights
    of NRG as lessee of the CT facility under a long-term lease with
    Audrain County, and UE assumed NRG’s obligations under the
    lease. This lease was entered into pursuant to Missouri economic
    development statutes to provide a development incentive property
    tax savings to the lessee for locating the CT facility in
    Audrain County. The lease will expire on December 1, 2023.
    UE as the lessee is responsible for rental payments under the
    lease in an amount sufficient to service the debt of a taxable
    industrial development revenue bond (principal amount of
    $240 million currently outstanding) issued to NRG by
    Audrain County in exchange for title to the NRG CT facility. As
    part of this acquisition, UE acquired the bond from NRG. Because
    rental payments are equal to debt service on the bond, there is
    no net cash expense relating to this lease. No capital was
    initially raised in the leasing transaction, and no capital was
    raised as a result of UE’s assumption of NRG’s lease
    obligations. Audrain County will retain title to the CT facility
    during the term of the bond and the lease, and therefore the
    facility will be exempt from ad valorem taxation. The title to
    the facility will be transferred to UE at the expiration of the
    lease. UE also has all operation and maintenance
    responsibilities for the CT facility.

Also in March 2006, following the receipt of all required
    regulatory approvals, UE completed the purchase from
    subsidiaries of Aquila, Inc., of the 510-megawatt Goose Creek CT
    facility in Piatt County, Illinois, at a price of
    $106 million, and the 340-megawatt Raccoon Creek CT
    facility located in Clay County, Illinois, at a price of
    $71 million.

These CT facility purchases were designed to help meet UE’s
    increased generating capacity needs as well as to



provide UE with additional flexibility in determining the timing
    of future baseload generating capacity additions. These
    purchases were accounted for as asset purchases.

NOTE 3 –
    RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS

Below is a summary of significant regulatory proceedings. We are
    unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these regulatory
    proceedings, the timing of the final decisions of the various
    agencies, or the impact on our results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity.

Missouri

Electric

With the expiration of an electric rate moratorium that provided
    for no changes in UE’s electric rates before July 1,
    2006, UE filed in July 2006 a request with the MoPSC for an
    increase in base rates for electric service. UE’s filing
    included a proposed average increase in electric rates of 17.7%,
    or $361 million. UE is proposing to limit the increase on
    residential rates to 10%, allocating requested revenue amounts
    above that level to other customer classes. This rate increase
    filing was based on a test year ended June 30, 2006, and
    included known and measurable items through January 1,
    2007. Since UE’s last electric rate case in 2002, UE has
    invested $2.5 billion in its electric operations. Those
    investments included more than $700 million for 2,600
    megawatts of new generation to meet growing customer power
    demands. UE’s July 2006 electric rate request includes,
    among other items, the following features:

•

a requested return on equity of 12%, and a rate base of
    $5.8 billion with a capital structure including about 52%
    common equity;

•

a request for a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism
    under the provisions of a Missouri state law enacted in 2005
    (see MoPSC Rulemaking Proceeding below in this note for
    additional information);

•

a proposed alternative mechanism for the MoPSC’s
    consideration to share off-system sales margins with ratepayers;

•

an increase in depreciation rates;

•

renewable energy proposals, including the addition of 100
    megawatts of renewable energy by 2010; and

•

commitments to offer low-income energy assistance and energy
    conservation programs.

Costs incurred related to the December 2005 failure of UE’s
    Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric plant for the cleanup of
    a nearby state park, reimbursement of state costs, and
    resolution of individuals’ claims were excluded from the
    revenue increase request.

In December 2006, the MoPSC staff and other stakeholders filed
    direct testimony in response to UE’s electric rate increase
    filing. The MoPSC staff recommended in their testimony an
    electric rate reduction of $136 million to
    $168 million based on a return on equity of 9.0% to 9.75%.
    The Missouri attorney general recommended a $53 million
    rate reduction based on a 9% return on equity. The Missouri
    Office of Public Counsel recommended a return on equity of
    9.65%. The major factors contributing to the difference between
    the UE rate increase request and the MoPSC staff rate reduction
    recommendation include return on equity, depreciation levels,
    the treatment of a cost-base contract from EEI, that expired in
    December 2005, margins for interchange sales, and the treatment
    of emission allowance sales, among other matters. In addition,
    the MoPSC staff and intervenors have recommended that UE not be
    granted the right to use a fuel and purchased power cost
    recovery mechanism. A decision from the MoPSC is expected no
    later than June 2007.

Gas

In July 2006, UE filed a request with the MoPSC for an
    $11 million increase in natural gas delivery rates, based
    on an 11.5% return on equity, and a rate base of
    $218 million with a capital structure including about 52%
    common equity. In December 2006, the MoPSC staff and other
    stakeholders filed testimony in response to UE’s gas rate
    increase filing. The MoPSC staff recommended in their testimony
    a gas rate increase of $2 million to $3 million based
    on a return on equity of 9.0% to 9.75%, and a rate base of
    $201 million with a capital structure including 52% common
    equity. A decision from the MoPSC is expected no later than June
    2007.

MoPSC Rulemaking
    Proceeding

In July 2005, a law was enacted that enables the MoPSC to put in
    place fuel and purchased power and environmental cost recovery
    mechanisms for Missouri’s utilities. The law also includes
    rate case filing requirements, a 2.5% annual rate increase cap
    for the environmental cost recovery mechanism, and prudency
    reviews, among other things. Rules for the fuel and purchased
    power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the MoPSC in
    September 2006 and became effective during the fourth quarter of
    2006. We are unable to predict when rules implementing the
    environmental cost recovery mechanism will be formally proposed
    and adopted. UE requested a fuel and purchased power cost
    recovery mechanism in its electric rate case filed with the
    MoPSC in July 2006. The MoPSC staff and intervenors have
    recommended that UE not be granted the right to use such a
    mechanism. UE also requested an environmental cost recovery
    mechanism as part of this electric rate case. However, no
    environmental adjustment clause has been submitted in the rate
    case since final environmental cost recovery rules have not been
    adopted. UE’s requests are subject to approval by the MoPSC.

Illinois

Electric

Under the Illinois Customer Choice Law, as amended with the
    consent of the Illinois utilities, CIPS’, CILCO’s and
    IP’s rates were frozen through January 1, 2007. In
    order to meet their customers’ power requirements, CIPS
    entered into a power supply agreement with Marketing Company and
    CILCO entered into an agreement with AERG for all of their power
    requirements through December 31, 2006. As part of
    Ameren’s acquisition of IP, IP entered into a power supply



agreement with DYPM to supply about 70% of its electric customer
    requirements through the end of 2006. See
    Note 13 – Related Party Transactions for a
    discussion of the affiliate power supply agreements. The
    following is a discussion of the current status of significant
    matters affecting our Illinois electric operations.

Illinois Power
    Procurement

During 2004, the ICC conducted workshops to seek input from
    interested parties on the framework for retail electric rate
    determination and power procurement after the Illinois electric
    rate freeze expired on January 1, 2007, and supply
    contracts expired on December 31, 2006.

In February 2005, CIPS, CILCO and IP filed with the ICC a
    proposed process for power procurement through an ICC-monitored
    auction, including, among other things, a rate mechanism to pass
    power supply costs directly through to customers. The form of
    power supply would meet the full requirements of each utility,
    and the risk of fluctuations in power supply requirements would
    be borne by the supplier. In January 2006, the ICC issued an
    order that unanimously approved the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ proposed power procurement auction and the
    related tariffs for use commencing January 2, 2007,
    including the retail rates by which power supply costs would be
    passed through to customers. The order included the following
    key findings and provisions:

•

The auction proposal is reasonably designed to enable CIPS,
    CILCO and IP to procure power supply in a competitive and
    least-cost manner.

•

There is a limitation of 35% on the amount of power any single
    supplier can provide the Ameren Illinois Utilities’
    expected annual load. Ameren-affiliated companies are considered
    one supplier for purposes of this limitation.

•

The proposal requires a portfolio of one-, two-, and three-year
    supply contracts.

•

Full cost recovery through a rate mechanism is permitted.

•

Annual, postauction prudence reviews by the ICC are required.

In accordance with the January 2006 ICC order, the power
    procurement auction was held at the beginning of September 2006.
    On September 14, 2006, the ICC determined that it would not
    investigate the results of the auction to procure power for
    fixed-price customers, which include the vast majority of
    electric customers of CIPS, CILCO and IP. On September 15,
    2006, the independent auction manager, NERA Economic Consulting,
    declared a successful result in the auction for fixed-price
    customers. The auction clearing price was about $65 per
    megawatthour for the fixed-price residential and small
    commercial product and about $85 per megawatthour for large
    commercial and industrial customers. Marketing Company was
    awarded sales in the auction. See Note 13 –
    Related Party Transactions for a discussion of these affiliate
    power supply agreements. As a result of the high auction price
    for the large commercial and industrial customers, almost all of
    these customers chose a different supplier.

Certain Illinois legislators, the Illinois attorney general, the
    Illinois governor and other parties sought to block the power
    procurement auction. They continue to challenge the auction and
    the structure for the recovery of costs for power supply
    resulting from the auction through rates to customers. Opponents
    of the power procurement auction and related tariffs claim that
    the ICC did not have authority to approve market-based rates for
    electric service that have not been declared
    “competitive” pursuant to

Section 16-113

of the Illinois Customer Choice Law. They further claim that the
    energy component of CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s
    retail rates for electricity should not be based on the costs to
    procure energy and capacity in the wholesale market. CIPS, CILCO
    and IP have received favorable rulings from the ICC and the
    circuit court of Cook County, Illinois, on opposition claims
    filed by the Illinois attorney general, CUB and ELPC.

Various parties, including CIPS, CILCO, IP, the Illinois
    attorney general, CUB, and ELPC, have appealed to Illinois
    district appellate courts the ICC’s denial of rehearing
    requests with respect to its January 2006 order. Although CIPS,
    CILCO and IP are generally supportive of the ICC order, they
    filed a request for rehearing with regard to the provision of
    the January 2006 order requiring an annual postauction prudence
    review to be performed by the ICC. In February 2006, they
    appealed the ICC’s denial of the request to the appellate
    court for the Fourth District in Illinois. CIPS, CILCO and IP
    asserted in their request for rehearing that there is no basis
    for such a prudence review. In their requests for rehearing of
    the January 2006 ICC order and their appeals of the ICC’s
    denial of their requests filed with the First District Illinois
    appellate court in March and April 2006, the Illinois attorney
    general, CUB and ELPC asserted that the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities power procurement auction should be dismissed on the
    basis of arguments generally similar to those that they
    previously raised. In June 2006, the Illinois attorney general
    filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Illinois seeking a
    direct and expedited review of appeals filed with Illinois
    district courts by various parties of the ICC’s January
    2006 order approving the Illinois power procurement auction and
    a stay on implementation of the order. In this petition, the
    Illinois attorney general raised similar arguments to those
    discussed above. In August 2006, the Supreme Court of Illinois
    denied the Illinois attorney general’s petition and ordered
    that the appeals be consolidated in the appellate court for the
    Second District in Illinois. The Second District appellate court
    granted a motion of the Illinois attorney general to dismiss
    CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s appeal regarding the need
    for an annual postauction prudence review claiming that it was
    filed prematurely. CIPS, CILCO and IP appealed that decision to
    the Illinois Supreme Court, where it is now pending. In
    addition, on December 21, 2006, the Illinois attorney
    general filed a motion to stay the effectiveness of the retail
    rates approved by the ICC in its January 2006 order. The motion
    was denied by the Second District appellate court on
    December 29, 2006, and upon appeal, denied by the Illinois
    Supreme Court in January 2007. The Illinois attorney
    general’s, CUB’s and ELPC’s



appeals at the Second District appellate court are still
    pending. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.

Delivery Service
    Rate Cases

CIPS, CILCO and IP filed rate cases with the ICC in December
    2005 to modify their electric delivery service rates effective
    January 2, 2007. CIPS, CILCO and IP requested to increase
    their annual revenues for electric delivery service by
    $202 million in the aggregate (CIPS –
    $14 million, CILCO – $43 million and
    IP – $145 million). In October 2006, the
    administrative law judges issued a proposed order, which
    included a recommended revenue increase for electric delivery
    service of $147 million in the aggregate (CIPS –
    $8 million, CILCO – $29 million and
    IP – $110 million). In November 2006, the ICC
    issued an order approving an annual revenue increase for
    electric delivery service of $97 million in the aggregate
    (CIPS – $8 million decrease, CILCO –
    $21 million increase and IP – $84 million
    increase). The ICC’s order was based on a return on equity
    of 10.08%, 10.08% and 10.12% for CIPS, CILCO and IP,
    respectively. In December 2006, the ICC granted the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities’ petition for rehearing of the November
    2006 order on the recovery of certain administrative and general
    expenses, totaling $50 million, that were disallowed. The
    ICC’s decision on the recovery of these expenses is due in
    May 2007. The ICC denied requests for rehearings filed by other
    parties to this case. Prior to January 2, 2007, most
    customers were taking service under a frozen bundled electric
    rate, which included the cost of power, so these delivery
    service revenue changes will not directly correspond to a change
    in CIPS’, CILCO’s or IP’s revenues or earnings
    under the new electric delivery service rates.

Potential Electric
    Rate Freeze and Recovery of

Post-2006

Power Supply Costs

In February 2006, legislation was introduced in the Illinois
    House of Representatives that would have extended the electric
    rate freeze in Illinois through 2010. On October 2, 2006,
    Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, Michael
    Madigan, sent a letter to Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich
    asking the governor to call a special session of the Illinois
    General Assembly to consider this rate freeze legislation. In
    response, the Illinois governor sent a letter indicating that
    once the votes to pass the legislation were in place, he would
    immediately call for a special session of the legislature. The
    governor’s letter further indicated that if a consensus
    among members of the general assembly was not reached in the
    near future, he would call a special session in that event as
    well. No special session was called. The governor’s letter
    stated that he continued to support legislation extending the
    rate freeze and would like to sign it into law as soon as
    possible. Copies of the speaker’s and governor’s
    letters appear as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, to
    the Current Report on

Form 8-K

dated October 4, 2006. During the Illinois General
    Assembly’s session that ended in January 2007, the Illinois
    House of Representatives passed legislation to freeze 2006 rates
    through 2010, and the Illinois Senate passed legislation
    containing an electric rate increase phase-in plan. The Illinois
    Senate bill provided for a mandatory phase-in of the 2007
    increase in residential electric rates over a three-year period.
    Neither piece of legislation was passed by the other chamber
    before the end of the session in early January 2007.

Any legislative measure will need to be approved by the Illinois
    House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate, and signed by
    the governor before it can become law. New rates for CIPS, CILCO
    and IP reflecting the power costs resulting from the
    ICC-approved September 2006 auction and the delivery service
    rates authorized by the November 2006 ICC order became effective
    January 2, 2007. A new Illinois General Assembly went into
    session in late January 2007. As a result, all previous bills
    expired. New bills have been introduced during the current
    legislative session, including legislation to rollback rates to
    2006 levels similar to previously proposed legislation.

CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP believe that legislation freezing
    electric rates at 2006 levels would have a material adverse
    effect on their results of operations, financial position, and
    liquidity, including the financial insolvency of CIPS, CILCORP,
    CILCO and IP. They believe it could cause significant job losses
    and, without governmental intervention, significant disruptions
    in electric and gas service. Ameren’s Illinois utilities
    own no generation facilities, so the companies must purchase
    power in the competitive market to meet their customers’
    energy needs. If electric rates were frozen at 2006 levels, the
    major credit rating agencies have stated that the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities’ credit ratings would be downgraded to
    deep junk (or speculative) status . Such a downgrade of
    CILCO’s ratings would also result in a similar downgrade of
    CILCORP’s ratings. We believe CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP
    would be faced with potential collateral and prepayment demands
    for products and services, such as natural gas, and would run
    out of cash and available credit and be unable to borrow. We
    believe this would cause the Ameren Illinois Utilities and
    CILCORP to become financially insolvent. In reaction to
    intensified political discussion in Illinois regarding electric
    rate freeze extension legislation, in October 2006 S&P
    downgraded the short- and long-term credit ratings of the Ameren
    Companies and kept the Ameren Companies on credit watch with
    negative implications. Moody’s placed the long-term debt
    credit ratings of the Ameren Companies under review for possible
    downgrade. Fitch placed the ratings of Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP,
    CILCO and IP on rating watch negative.

Electric Rate
    Increase Phase-in Plan

In December 2006, the ICC approved the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ Customer Elect Plan (Phase-in Plan) and related
    riders, which went into effect on January 2, 2007. The
    Phase-in Plan allows residential customers, eligible schools,
    local governments and small commercial customers to choose on an
    individual basis either to pay the full amount of higher
    electricity costs in 2007 or to phase in increases over a period
    of years. Under this plan, rate increases are phased in at an
    annual maximum increase of 14% over the prior year’s
    bundled rate, over three years

(2007-2009)

or until the full amount of the rate increase is



reached, whichever is earlier. At the end of the phase-in
    period, customers have three years

(2010-2012)

to repay the deferred costs at a carrying charge interest rate
    of 3.25%. Participation in the plan is voluntary and
    approximately 90% of the Ameren Illinois Utilities’
    customers are eligible. As part of this plan, CIPS, CILCO and IP
    made additional contributions of $4 million,
    $3 million, and $8 million, respectively, in December
    2006, to their Dollar More and Warm Neighbors programs, which
    provide bill paying assistance, energy conservation materials,
    and rebates for energy-efficient equipment. Customers have until
    August 21, 2007, to enroll in the plan. Those who enroll by
    April 10, 2007, will have deferred credits that are
    retroactive to January 2, 2007. On February 27, 2007,
    the Ameren Illinois Utilities announced that they intended to
    file an electric rate increase mitigation plan, with the ICC. As
    part of the plan which is subject to ICC approval, the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities would fund an approximate $20 million
    one-time reduction to active residential accounts that would
    appear on electric bills in March and April 2007. The rate
    mitigation plan is targeted to customers with high volume usage.
    As part of the filing the carrying charge of 3.25% in the
    current ICC-approved phase-in plan would be eliminated.

Summary

New electric rates for CIPS, CILCO and IP went into effect on
    January 2, 2007, reflecting delivery service tariffs
    approved by the ICC in November 2006 and full cost recovery of
    power procurement costs. Approximately 90% of the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities’ customers currently have the option to
    participate in the Phase-in Plan. We are unable to predict the
    results of the court appeals of the January 2006 ICC order
    approving CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s power
    procurement auction and the related tariffs, nor can we predict
    the actions the Illinois General Assembly and governor may take
    that might affect electric rates or the power procurement
    process for CIPS, CILCO and IP. Any decision or action that
    impairs the ability of CIPS, CILCO and IP to fully recover
    purchased power or distribution costs from their electric
    customers in a timely manner would result in material adverse
    consequences to Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP. These
    consequences could include a significant drop in credit ratings
    to deep junk (or speculative) status, a loss of access to the
    capital markets, higher borrowing costs, higher power supply
    costs, an inability to make timely energy infrastructure
    investments, significant risk of disruption in electric and gas
    service, significant job losses, and financial insolvency. In
    addition, Ameren, CILCORP and IP could be required to record a
    one-time charge for impairment of goodwill that was recorded
    when Ameren acquired these companies. As of December 31,
    2006, Ameren, CILCORP and IP had $830 million,
    $542 million and $213 million, respectively, of
    goodwill recorded on their balance sheets. Furthermore, if the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities are unable to recover their costs from
    customers, the utilities could be required to cease applying
    SFAS No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of
    Certain Types of Regulation,” which allows CIPS, CILCORP,
    CILCO and IP to defer certain costs pursuant to actions of rate
    regulators. This would result in the elimination of all
    regulatory assets recorded by CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP on
    their balance sheets and a one-time extraordinary charge on
    their and Ameren’s statements of income that could be
    material. As of December 31, 2006, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and
    IP had $146 million, $75 million, $75 million and
    $401 million, respectively, recorded as regulatory assets
    on their balance sheets.

Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP will continue to explore a
    number of legal and regulatory actions, strategies and
    alternatives to address these Illinois electric issues. CIPS,
    CILCORP, CILCO and IP expect to take whatever actions are
    necessary to protect their financial interests, including
    seeking the protection of the bankruptcy courts. However, there
    can be no assurance that Ameren and the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities will prevail over the stated opposition by certain
    Illinois legislators, the Illinois attorney general, the
    Illinois governor, and other stakeholders, or that the legal and
    regulatory actions, strategies and alternatives that Ameren and
    the Ameren Illinois Utilities are considering will be successful.

Federal

Regional
    Transmission Organization

In early 2004, UE received authorization from the MoPSC and FERC
    to participate in the MISO for a five-year period, with further
    participation subject to approvals by the MoPSC. Consistent with
    the orders issued by the MoPSC and FERC, the MoPSC continues to
    set the transmission component of UE’s rates to serve its
    bundled retail load.

On May 1, 2004, functional control, but not ownership, of
    UE’s and CIPS’ transmission systems was transferred to
    the MISO. On September 30, 2004, prior to the completion of
    Ameren’s acquisition of IP as required by FERC’s order
    approving the acquisition, IP transferred functional control,
    but not ownership, of its transmission system to the MISO. These
    transfers had no accounting impact on UE, CIPS and IP because
    they continue to own their transmission assets.

In 2004, as part of the transfer of functional control of
    UE’s and CIPS’ transmission system to the MISO, Ameren
    received $26 million, which represented the refund of the
    $13 million exit fee paid by UE and the $5 million
    exit fee paid by CIPS, both of which were expensed when they
    left the MISO in 2001, plus $1 million interest on the exit
    fees and the reimbursement of $7 million that was invested
    in the proposed Alliance RTO. These refunds resulted in aftertax
    gains of $11 million, $8 million, and $3 million
    for Ameren, UE, and CIPS respectively, which were recorded in
    other operations and maintenance expenses during the quarter
    ended June 30, 2004. As part of the transfer of functional
    control of IP’s transmission system to the MISO at the end
    of September 2004, predecessor IP also received a refund of its
    MISO exit fee, plus interest on the exit fee, and RTO
    development costs resulting in aftertax gains of $9 million
    during the quarter ended September 30, 2004.

Before Ameren’s acquisition of CILCO in 2003, CILCO was
    already a member of the MISO, and it had transferred functional
    control of its transmission system to the MISO.



Genco does not own transmission assets, but pays the MISO to use
    the transmission system to transmit power from the Genco
    generating plants.

Pursuant to a series of FERC orders, FERC put Seams Elimination
    Cost Adjustment (SECA) charges into effect on December 1,
    2004, subject to refund and hearing procedures. The SECA charges
    were a transition mechanism that was in place for 16 months
    from December 1, 2004, to March 31, 2006, to
    compensate transmission owners in the MISO and PJM for revenues
    lost when FERC eliminated the regional

through-and-out

rates previously applicable to transactions crossing the border
    between the MISO and PJM. The SECA charge was a nonbypassable
    surcharge payable by load-serving entities in proportion to the
    benefit they realized from the elimination of the regional

through-and-out

rates as of December 1, 2004. The MISO transmission owners
    (including UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP) and the PJM transmission
    owners filed their proposed SECA charges in November 2004 as
    compliance filings pursuant to the FERC order. A FERC
    administrative law judge issued an initial decision in August
    2006, recommending that FERC reject both of the SECA compliance
    filings (the filing for SECA charges made by the transmission
    owners in the MISO and the filing for SECA charges made by the
    transmission owners in PJM). FERC has not acted on the initial
    decision. Both before and after the initial decision, various
    parties (including UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP as part of the group
    of MISO transmission owners) filed numerous bilateral or
    multiparty settlements. FERC has approved many of the
    settlements. The more recently filed settlements are pending.
    Neither the MISO transmission owners, including UE, CIPS, CILCO
    and IP, nor the PJM transmission owners have been able to settle
    with all parties. During the transition period of
    December 1, 2004 to March 31, 2006, Ameren, UE, CIPS,
    and IP received net revenues from the SECA charge of
    $10 million, $3 million, $1 million, and
    $6 million, respectively. CILCO’s net SECA charges
    were less than $1 million. Until FERC acts on the pending
    settlements and issues a final order on the initial decision, we
    cannot predict the ultimate impact of the SECA proceedings on
    UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s costs and
    revenues.

Hydroelectric
    License Renewal

In May 2005, UE, the U.S. Department of the Interior and
    various state agencies reached a settlement agreement that is
    expected to lead to FERC’s relicensing of UE’s Osage
    hydroelectric plant for another 40 years. The settlement
    must be approved by FERC. The current FERC license expired on
    February 28, 2006. Operations are permitted to continue
    under the expired license until the license renewal is approved.

Joint Dispatch
    Agreement

See Note 13 – Related Party Transactions for a
    description of the JDA among UE, CIPS and Genco, which
    terminated on December 31, 2006.

January 2006 JDA
    Amendment

As a result of the February 2005 MoPSC order approving the
    transfer of UE’s Illinois service territory to CIPS that
    was completed on May 2, 2005, the provision in the JDA that
    determines the allocation between UE and Genco of margins from
    short-term sales of excess generation to third parties had to be
    modified. Specifically, the MoPSC order required an amendment so
    that margins on third-party short-term power sales of excess
    generation would be allocated between UE and Genco based on
    generation output, not on load requirements, as the agreement
    had provided. In March 2006, FERC approved the amendment filed
    by UE, CIPS and Genco, effective January 10, 2006. This
    change in the allocation methodology resulted in a
    $23 million transfer of electric margins from Genco to UE
    during the year ended December 31, 2006.

Termination of
    JDA

On July 7, 2006, UE, CIPS and Genco mutually consented to
    waive a one-year termination notice requirement of the JDA and
    agreed to terminate it on December 31, 2006. This action
    with respect to the JDA was accepted by FERC in September 2006.

The benefits of the JDA to UE and Genco changed due to the
    emergence of transparent wholesale markets, the dispatching of
    generation being conducted by the MISO, and changes to the
    Illinois regulatory framework, among other things. As a result,
    UE believed the benefit it would receive from retaining the
    power it was transferring under the JDA to Genco at incremental
    cost would exceed the benefit it would have received from being
    able to call upon Genco’s generation under the JDA at
    incremental cost. Since UE was prepared to immediately provide
    Genco with one-year notice of termination in June 2006, Genco
    believed the potential benefit it could receive from being able
    to call upon UE’s generation through June 2007 was
    outweighed by, among other things, the negative consequences
    associated with the continued existence of the JDA past
    December 31, 2006. In particular, Genco believed that the
    JDA was no longer necessary or effective for dispatching
    Genco’s generation jointly with that of UE, because of
    changes in the marketplace for the sale of electricity,
    including the MISO Day Two Energy Market, and the centralized
    dispatching of generation by MISO. Additionally, the JDA was
    based on a combined control area for the UE and CIPS
    transmission facilities located in Missouri and Illinois,
    respectively. This combined control area created operational
    inefficiencies for Genco to effectively participate through
    Marketing Company in the Illinois power procurement auction to
    supply power beginning January 1, 2007. In conjunction with
    terminating the JDA, Ameren’s transmission-owning entities
    restructured their control areas into two areas: one in Missouri
    for UE’s transmission facilities and one in Illinois for
    the transmission facilities of CIPS, CILCO and IP. In December
    of 2006, FERC authorized the restructuring of the control areas
    as requested.

As a result of the termination of the JDA on December 31,
    2006, UE and Genco no longer have the



obligation to provide power to each other. In 2006, Genco
    received from UE under the JDA net transfers of
    10.1 million megawatthours of power at an average price of
    $19 per megawatthour and generated 15.3 million
    megawatthours of power from its plants at an average cost of
    $20 per megawatthour. This power was used in 2006 to supply
    CIPS’ load and other wholesale and retail customers at an
    average selling price of $36 per megawatthour. In 2006,
    Genco also sold 2.1 million net megawatthours of power in
    the interchange market at an average price of $38 per
    megawatthour. Upon termination of the JDA, Genco no longer
    receives the margins on sales that were supplied with power from
    UE.

Ameren’s and UE’s earnings will be affected by the
    termination of the JDA when UE’s rates are adjusted by the
    MoPSC. As discussed under Missouri Electric in this Note, UE
    filed a request in July 2006 with the MoPSC to increase its
    electric rates by $361 million. UE’s requested
    increase is net of the decrease in its revenue requirement
    resulting from increased margins expected to result from the
    termination of the JDA.

The ultimate impact of the termination of the JDA and the
    MoPSC’s treatment of the effects of such termination in
    UE’s current rate case proceeding on the Ameren
    Companies’ results of operations, financial position, or
    liquidity cannot be predicted at this time.

Leveraged
    Leases

Ameren owns interests in certain assets that were acquired with
    the acquisition of CILCORP that have been financed as leveraged
    leases. By an order dated April 15, 2004, issued pursuant
    to PUHCA 1935, the SEC determined that certain nonutility
    interests and investments of CILCORP and its subsidiaries,
    including investments in several leveraged leases, were not
    retainable by Ameren. The April 2004 SEC order required that
    Ameren cause its subsidiaries to sell or otherwise dispose of
    the nonretainable interests. The nonretainable interests
    primarily consist of lease interests in commercial real estate
    properties and equipment. The SEC approved the divestiture
    transaction structure proposed by Ameren in December 2005.

Ameren also owns interests in certain assets, acquired through
    the acquisition of CIPSCO, that have been financed as leveraged
    leases. One of these is an investment by an Ameren subsidiary
    involving an aircraft leased to Delta Air Lines, Inc. In
    September 2005, Delta Air Lines filed for protection under
    Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Although
    Ameren continues in its ownership of the lease, Ameren cannot
    predict the ultimate ability of Delta Air Lines to service debt
    and pay future rentals required under the lease, or the outcome
    of the bankruptcy process. Accordingly, Ameren recorded a pretax
    impairment of $10 million in the third quarter of 2005. By
    an order dated December 13, 2005, issued pursuant to PUHCA
    1935, the SEC determined that CIPSCO’s interest in the
    Delta Air Lines leveraged lease should be divested. The SEC
    approved the divestiture transaction structure proposed by
    Ameren.

Ameren and several of its registrant and nonregistrant
    subsidiaries sold leveraged leases during 2006. The overall net
    gain (loss) before taxes from the sale of all these assets
    recognized by Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO was $3 million,
    ($7 million) and ($11 million), respectively.

Ameren is actively pursuing the sale of its interests in its
    remaining three leveraged lease assets.

Regulatory Assets

UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP continually assess the recoverability of
    their regulatory assets. Under current accounting standards,
    regulatory assets are written off to earnings when it is no
    longer probable that such amounts will be recovered through
    future revenues.

At December 31, 2006, Ameren and certain of its
    subsidiaries had $1.65 billion of committed credit
    facilities, consisting of two facilities described below, in the
    amounts of $1.15 billion and $500 million. The
    $1.15 billion facility and the 2006 $500 million
    facility mature in July 2010 and January 2010,
    respectively.

Ameren could directly borrow under the $1.15 billion
    facility up to the entire amount of the facility. UE could
    directly borrow under this facility up to $500 million on a

364-day

basis. Genco could directly borrow under this facility up to
    $150 million on a

364-day

basis. Until July 13, 2006, CIPS, CILCO and IP could also
    each directly borrow under this facility up to $150 million
    on a

364-day

basis. On July 14, 2006, the $1.15 billion credit
    facility was amended. The amended facility will terminate on
    July 14, 2010, with respect to Ameren. Effective
    July 13, 2006, the termination date for UE and Genco was
    extended to July 12, 2007. CIPS, CILCO and IP no longer had
    borrowing authority under this facility effective July 13,
    2006, but remained parties to the agreement until
    September 8, 2006, as discussed in the Indebtedness
    Provisions and Other Covenants section below. Under the amended
    facility, Ameren will continue to have $1.15 billion of
    borrowing availability. UE and Genco will continue to have
    $500 million and $150 million, respectively, of
    borrowing availability.

Under the amended $1.15 billion credit facility, the
    principal amount of each revolving loan under the facility will
    be due and payable no later than the final maturity of the
    facility in the case of Ameren and the last day of the
    then-applicable

364-day

period in the case of UE and Genco. The principal amount of each
    loan will be due and payable at the end of the interest period
    applicable to it, which shall not be later than the final
    maturity date of the facility. Swingline loans will be made on

same-day

notice and will mature five business days after they are made.

Ameren, UE and Genco will use the proceeds of any borrowings
    under the amended facility for general corporate purposes,
    including for working capital, commercial paper liquidity
    support, and to fund loans under the Ameren money pool
    arrangements. See Exhibit 10.1 to the Current Report on

Form 8-K,

dated July 18, 2006, for a copy of the amended facility
    agreement.

On July 14, 2006, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG entered
    into a $500 million multiyear, senior secured credit
    facility expiring in 2010 (the 2006 $500 million credit
    facility). Borrowing authority under this facility was effective
    immediately for AERG and CILCORP and effective for CIPS, CILCO
    and IP on September 8, 2006, upon the receipt of regulatory
    approvals and the issuance by CIPS, CILCO and IP of mortgage
    bonds as security as described below. Once CIPS, CILCO and IP
    were authorized to borrow under this new facility, they were
    removed as parties to the $1.15 billion credit facility.

On February 9, 2007, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG
    entered into another $500 million multiyear, senior secured
    credit facility (the 2007 $500 million credit facility),
    also expiring in January 2010. Borrowing authority under this
    facility was effective immediately for CILCORP and AERG. The
    ability of CIPS, CILCO and IP to borrow under this facility is
    subject to the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, and
    the issuance by CIPS, CILCO and IP of mortgage bonds as security
    as described below. The 2007 $500 million credit facility
    is in addition to the 2006 $500 million credit facility,
    which remains in effect.

The obligations of each borrower under the 2006
    $500 million credit facility and the 2007 $500 million
    credit facility are several and not joint, and are not
    guaranteed by Ameren or any other subsidiary of Ameren. The
    maximum amount available to each borrower under the 2006
    $500 million credit facility, including for issuance of
    letters of credit on its behalf, is limited as follows:
    CIPS – $135 million, CILCORP –
    $50 million, CILCO – $150 million,
    IP – $150 million and AERG –
    $200 million. Each of the companies has drawn various loans
    under this credit facility. Under the 2007 $500 million
    credit facility, the maximum amount available to each borrower,
    including for issuance of letters of credit on its behalf, is
    limited as follows: CILCORP – $125 million,
    IP – $200 million and AERG –
    $100 million. CIPS and CILCO have the option of permanently
    reducing their borrowing authority under the 2006
    $500 million credit facility and shifting, in one or more
    transactions, such capacity to the 2007 $500 million credit
    facility up to the same limits. The borrowing authority of CIPS
    and CILCO under the 2006 $500 million credit facility and
    the 2007 $500 million credit facility cannot at any time
    exceed $135 million and $150 million, respectively, in
    the aggregate. Until CIPS or CILCO elects to increase its
    borrowing capacity under the 2007 $500 million credit
    facility and issue first mortgage bonds as security for its
    obligations thereunder, as described below, it will not be
    considered a borrower under the 2007 $500 million credit
    facility and will not be subject to the covenants thereof
    (except as a subsidiary of a borrower). Borrowings by CIPS,
    CILCO and IP under the 2006 and 2007 $500 million credit
    facilities is on a

364-day

basis. The borrowing companies will use the proceeds of any
    borrowings for working capital and other general corporate
    purposes; however, a portion of the borrowings by AERG may be
    limited to financing or refinancing the development, management
    and operation of any of its projects or assets. The 2006 and
    2007 $500 million credit facilities will terminate on
    January 14, 2010.

The obligations of CIPS, CILCO and IP under the 2006
    $500 million facility are secured by the issuance on
    September 8, 2006, of mortgage bonds by each such utility
    under its respective mortgage indenture in the amounts of
    $135 million, $150 million and $150 million,
    respectively. Subject to the receipt of regulatory approval, the
    obligations of these companies under the 2007 $500 million
    credit facility will be secured by the issuance of mortgage
    bonds by each such utility under its respective mortgage
    indenture. If CIPS or CILCO elect to transfer borrowing
    authority from the 2006 $500 million credit facility to the
    2007 $500 million credit facility, that company will retire
    an appropriate amount of first mortgage bonds issued with
    respect to the 2006 $500 million credit facility and issue
    new bonds in an equal amount to secure its obligations under the
    2007 $500 million



credit facility. The obligations of CILCORP under both the 2006
    $500 million credit facility and the 2007 $500 million
    credit facility are secured by a pledge of the common stock of
    CILCO. The obligations of AERG under both the 2006
    $500 million credit facility and the 2007 $500 million
    credit facility are secured by a mortgage and security interest
    in its E.D. Edwards and Duck Creek power plants and related
    licenses, permits, and similar rights. See Exhibit 10.2 to
    the Current Report on

Form 8-K,

dated July 18, 2006, for a copy of the 2006
    $500 million credit facility agreement and see
    Exhibit 10.1 to the Current Report on

Form 8-K,

dated February 13, 2007, for a copy of the 2007
    $500 million credit facility agreement.

As a condition to the amendment of the $1.15 billion credit
    facility and the closing of the 2006 $500 million credit
    facility, effective July 14, 2006, Ameren terminated its
    $350 million credit facility. Ameren was the only borrower
    under this agreement, and there was no early termination penalty.

The $1.15 billion credit facility and the now-terminated
    $350 million credit facility were used to support the
    commercial paper programs that included all outstanding external
    short-term debt of Ameren and UE as of December 31, 2006
    and 2005. The $1.15 billion amended facility will continue
    to support Ameren’s and UE’s commercial paper
    programs. Access to the $1.15 billion credit facility, the
    2006 $500 million credit facility and the 2007
    $500 million credit facility for the Ameren Companies is
    subject to reduction as borrowings are made by affiliates. As a
    result of S&P’s downgrade of Ameren’s and
    UE’s short-term ratings to

A-3

in
    October 2006, Ameren and UE are currently limited in their
    access to the commercial paper market.

In April 2006, EEI’s $20 million bank credit facility
    expired and was not renewed.

Money
    Pools

Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries
    to coordinate and provide for certain short-term cash and
    working capital requirements. Separate money pools are
    maintained for utility and non-state-regulated entities. Ameren
    Services is responsible for operation and administration of the
    money pool agreements.

Utility

Through the utility money pool, the pool participants may access
    the committed credit facilities. CIPS, CILCO and IP borrow from
    each other through the utility money pool agreement subject to
    applicable regulatory

short-term

borrowing authorizations. Although UE and Ameren Services are
    parties to the utility money pool agreement, they are not
    currently borrowing or lending under the agreement. Ameren
    Services administers the utility money pool and tracks internal
    and external funds separately. Ameren and AERG may participate
    in the utility money pool only as lenders. Internal funds are
    surplus funds contributed to the utility money pool from
    participants. The primary source of external funds for the
    utility money pool is the 2006 $500 million and the 2007
    $500 million credit facilities. The total amount available
    to the pool participants from the utility money pool at any
    given time is reduced by the amount of borrowings by their
    affiliates, but increased to the extent that the pool
    participants have surplus funds or other external sources. The
    availability of funds is also determined by funding requirement
    limits established by regulatory authorizations. CIPS, CILCO and
    IP rely on the utility money pool to coordinate and provide for
    certain short-term cash and working capital requirements.
    Borrowers receiving a loan under the utility money pool
    agreement must repay the principal amount of such loan, together
    with accrued interest. The rate of interest depends on the
    composition of internal and external funds in the utility money
    pool. The average interest rate for borrowing under the utility
    money pool for the year ended December 31, 2006, was 5.03%
    (2005 – 3.25%).

Non-state-regulated
    subsidiaries

Ameren Services, Resources Company, Genco, AERG, Marketing
    Company, AFS, Ameren Energy and other non-state-regulated Ameren
    subsidiaries have the ability, subject to Ameren parent company
    authorization, to access funding from Ameren’s
    $1.15 billion credit facility through a

non-state-regulated

subsidiary money pool agreement subject to applicable regulatory
    short-term borrowing authorizations. However, the total amount
    available to the pool participants at any time is reduced by
    borrowings from Ameren made by its subsidiaries and is increased
    to the extent that other pool participants advance surplus funds
    to the

non-state-regulated

subsidiary money pool or other external sources. At
    December 31, 2006, $861 million was available through
    the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool, excluding
    additional funds available through excess cash balances. The

non-state-regulated

subsidiary money pool was established to coordinate and to
    provide for short-term cash and working capital requirements of
    Ameren’s

non-state-regulated

activities. It is administered by Ameren Services. Borrowers
    receiving a loan under the non-state-regulated subsidiary money
    pool agreement must repay the principal amount of such loan,
    together with accrued interest. The rate of interest depends on
    the composition of internal and external funds in the
    non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool. These rates are based
    on the cost of funds used for money pool advances. Ameren and
    CILCORP are authorized to act only as lenders to the

non-state-regulated

subsidiary money pool. The average interest rate for borrowing
    under the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 was 4.65% (2005 – 5.49%).

See Note 13 – Related Party Transactions for the
    amount of interest income and expense from the money pool
    arrangements recorded by the Ameren Companies for the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.

In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement exists between
    Ameren, IP, and Ameren Services, which enables IP to make
    short-term borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount
    of borrowings outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral
    borrowing agreement and the utility



money pool agreement, together with any outstanding external
    short-term borrowings by IP, may not exceed $500 million
    pursuant to authorization from the ICC. IP is not currently
    borrowing under the unilateral borrowing agreement. Ameren
    Services is responsible for operation and administration of the
    agreements.

Indebtedness
    Provisions and Other Covenants

The bank credit facilities described above contain provisions
    which, among other things, place restrictions on the ability to
    incur liens, sell assets, and merge with other entities. As
    discussed above, the $1.15 billion credit facility was
    amended effective July 14, 2006. The provisions in the
    amended facility are similar to those in the prior facility,
    including the covenant that limits total indebtedness of each of
    Ameren, UE and Genco to 65% of consolidated total capitalization
    pursuant to a calculation defined in the facility. Exceeding
    these debt levels would result in a default under the
    $1.15 billion credit facility.

The amended $1.15 billion credit facility also contains
    default provisions similar to those in the prior facility,
    including cross defaults, with respect to a borrower under the
    facility, that can result from the occurrence of an event of
    default under any other facility covering indebtedness of that
    borrower or certain of its subsidiaries in excess of
    $50 million in the aggregate. The obligations of Ameren, UE
    and Genco under the amended facility remain several and not
    joint, and except under limited circumstances, the obligations
    of UE and Genco are not guaranteed by Ameren or any other
    subsidiary. With the termination of CIPS, CILCO and IP as
    parties to this agreement on September 8, 2006, they are no
    longer considered subsidiaries for purposes of the cross-default
    or other provisions, nor are CILCORP or AERG.

Under the amended $1.15 billion credit facility,
    restrictions apply limiting investments in and other transfers
    to CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP, AERG and their subsidiaries by
    Ameren and certain subsidiaries. Additionally, CIPS, CILCORP,
    CILCO, IP, AERG and their subsidiaries are excluded for purposes
    of determining compliance with the 65% total consolidated
    indebtedness to total consolidated capitalization financial
    covenant that remains in the amended facility.

Both the 2006 $500 million credit facility and the 2007
    $500 million credit facility entered into by CIPS, CILCORP,
    CILCO, IP and AERG, discussed above, limit the indebtedness of
    each borrower to 65% of consolidated total capitalization
    pursuant to a calculation set forth in the facilities. Events of
    default under these facilities apply separately to each borrower
    (and, except in the case of CILCORP, to their subsidiaries), and
    an event of default under these facilities does not constitute
    an event of default under the amended $1.15 billion credit
    facility and vice versa. In addition, if CIPS’,
    CILCO’s or IP’s senior secured long-term debt
    securities or first mortgage bonds, or CILCORP’s senior
    unsecured long-term debt securities, have received a

below-investment-grade

credit rating by either Moody’s or S&P, then such
    borrower will be limited to capital stock dividend payments of
    $10 million per year each, while such

below-investment-grade

credit rating is in effect. On July 26, 2006, Moody’s
    downgraded CILCORP’s senior unsecured long-term debt credit
    rating to below investment-grade, causing it to be subject to
    this dividend payment limitation. A similar restriction applies
    to AERG if its

debt-to-operating

cash flow ratio, as set forth in the facility, is above a 3.0 to
    1.0 ratio. As of December 31, 2006, AERG failed to meet the

debt-to-operating

cash flow ratio test in the 2006 $500 million credit
    facility. AERG, therefore, is currently limited in its ability
    to pay dividends to a maximum of $10 million per fiscal
    year. As a result of the limitation, CILCO’s and
    AERG’s net assets restricted for dividend payments were
    $525 million and $321 million, respectively, as of
    December 31, 2006. CIPS, CILCO and IP are not currently
    limited in their dividend payments by this provision of the 2006
    $500 million or 2007 $500 million credit facilities.
    Ameren’s access to dividends from CILCO would be limited by
    dividend restrictions at CILCORP.

The 2006 $500 million credit facility and the 2007
    $500 million credit facility also limit the amount of other
    secured indebtedness issuable by each borrower as follows: for
    CIPS, CILCO and IP, other secured debt is limited to that
    permitted under their respective mortgage indentures. For
    CILCORP, other secured debt is limited to $550 million
    under the 2006 $500 million credit facility and
    $425 million under the 2007 $500 million credit
    facility, secured by the pledge of CILCO stock. For AERG, other
    secured debt is limited to $200 million under the 2006
    $500 million credit facility and $100 million under
    the 2007 $500 million credit facility secured on an equal
    basis with its obligations under the facilities.

The 2006 $500 million credit facility provides that CIPS,
    CILCO and IP will agree to reserve future bonding capacity under
    their respective mortgage indentures (that is, agree to forgo
    the issuance of additional mortgage bonds otherwise permitted
    under the terms of each mortgage indenture) in the following
    amounts: CIPS, prior to December 31, 2007 –
    $50 million, on and after December 31, 2007, but prior
    to December 31, 2008 – $100 million, on and
    after December 31, 2008 – $150 million;
    CILCO – $25 million; and IP –
    $100 million. In addition, the credit facility prohibits
    CILCO from issuing any preferred stock if, after giving effect
    to such issuance, the aggregate liquidation value of all CILCO
    preferred stock issued after July 14, 2006, would exceed
    $50 million.

The 2007 $500 million credit facility provides that CIPS,
    CILCO and IP will agree to reserve future bonding capacity under
    their respective mortgage indentures in the following amounts:
    CIPS, prior to December 31, 2007 –
    $50 million, on and after December 31, 2007, but prior
    to December 31, 2008 – $100 million, on and
    after December 31, 2008, but prior to December 31,
    2009 – $150 million, on and after

    prior to December 31, 2007 – $25 million, on
    and after December 31, 2007, but prior to December 31,
    2008 – $50 million, on and after
    December 31, 2008, but prior to December 31,
    2009 – $75 million, on and after
    December 31, 2009 – $150 million;



and IP, prior to December 31, 2008 –
    $100 million, on and after December 31, 2008, but
    prior to December 31, 2009 – $200 million,
    on and after December 31, 2009 –
    $350 million.

As of December 31, 2006, the ratio of total indebtedness to
    total consolidated capitalization, calculated in accordance with
    the provisions of the $1.15 billion credit facility for
    Ameren, UE and Genco was 50%, 48% and 46%, respectively. The
    ratios for CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG, calculated in
    accordance with the provisions of the 2006 $500 million
    credit facility, were 49%, 54%, 41%, 44% and 29%, respectively.

None of Ameren’s credit facilities or financing
    arrangements contain credit rating triggers that would cause an
    event of default or acceleration of repayment of outstanding
    balances. At December 31, 2006, the Ameren Companies were
    in compliance with their credit facility provisions and
    covenants.

All of the Ameren Companies expect to fund maturities of
    long-term debt and contractual obligations through a combination
    of cash flow from operations and external financing. See
    Note 5 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity for a
    discussion of external financing availability.

Ameren

In June 2004, the SEC declared effective a

Form S-3

shelf registration statement filed by Ameren and its subsidiary
    trusts covering the offering from time to time of up to
    $2 billion of various types of securities, including
    long-term debt, trust preferred securities, and equity
    securities. In July 2004, Ameren issued, pursuant to the June

Form S-3

shelf registration statement, 10.9 million shares of its
    common stock at $42.00 per share, for net proceeds of
    $445 million. The proceeds from this offering were used to
    pay the cash portion of the purchase price for Ameren’s
    acquisition of IP and Dynegy’s 20% interest in EEI and, as
    described below under IP, to reduce IP debt assumed as part of
    the acquisition and to pay related premiums.

The purchase of IP on September 30, 2004, included the
    assumption of IP debt and preferred stock at closing of
    $1.8 billion. The assumed debt and preferred stock included
    $936 million of mortgage bonds, $509 million of
    pollution control indebtedness supported by mortgage bonds,
    $352 million of TFNs issued by IP SPT, and $13 million
    of preferred stock not acquired and owned by Ameren. Upon
    acquisition, total IP debt was increased to fair value by
    $191 million. The adjustment to the fair value of each debt
    series is being amortized to interest expense over its remaining
    life, or to the expected redemption date. As of
    December 31, 2006, the unamortized balance of this fair
    market value adjustment was $32 million, as a result of
    amortization and the redemption of several of IP’s debt
    series. The following table presents the amortization of the
    fair value adjustment for the succeeding five years:

Amount is less than $1 million.

In March 2004, the SEC declared effective a

Form S-3

registration statement filed by Ameren, authorizing the offering
    of 6 million additional shares of its common stock under
    DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are, at
    Ameren’s option, newly issued shares or treasury shares, or
    shares purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated
    transactions. Ameren is currently selling newly issued shares of
    its common stock under DRPlus. Under DRPlus and its 401(k)
    plans, Ameren issued 1.9 million, 2.1 million, and
    2.3 million shares of common stock in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    respectively, which were valued at $96 million,
    $109 million, and $107 million for the respective
    years.

In March 2002, Ameren issued $345 million of adjustable
    conversion-rate equity security units. The $25 adjustable
    conversion-rate equity security units each consisted of an
    Ameren senior unsecured note with a principal amount of $25
    maturing on May 15, 2007, and a contract to purchase, for
    $25, a fraction of a share of Ameren common stock on
    May 15, 2005. In February 2005, the annual interest rate on
    the $345 million principal amount



of Ameren’s senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2007
    was reset from 5.20% to 4.263%. As part of this remarketing,
    Ameren also repurchased $95 million in principal amount of
    the senior unsecured notes, which it subsequently retired. In
    May 2005, settlement of the stock purchase contracts resulted in
    Ameren issuing 7.4 million shares of common stock in
    exchange for $345 million of proceeds.

In December 2006, Ameren terminated interest rate swap
    transactions that were entered into in March 2002 to effectively
    convert its 5.70% fixed-rate notes to variable rate. In February
    2007, $100 million of Ameren’s 5.70% notes
    matured and were retired.

UE

In January 2005, UE issued, pursuant to its then-effective
    September 2003 SEC

Form S-3

shelf registration statement, $85 million of
    5.00% senior secured notes due February 1, 2020, with
    interest payable semi-annually on February 1 and
    August 1 of each year, beginning in August 2005. UE
    received net proceeds of $83 million, which were used to
    repay short-term debt temporarily incurred to fund the maturity
    of UE’s $85 million 7.375% first mortgage bonds due
    2004.

In July 2005, UE issued, pursuant to its then-effective
    September 2003 SEC

Form S-3

shelf registration statement, $300 million of
    5.30% senior secured notes due August 1, 2037, with
    interest payable semi-annually on February 1 and
    August 1 of each year, beginning in February 2006. UE
    received net proceeds of $296 million, which were used to
    repay short-term debt.

On October 20, 2005, the SEC declared effective a

Form S-3

shelf registration statement filed by UE and its subsidiary
    trust on September 23, 2005, amended on October 12,
    2005, covering the offering from time to time of up to
    $1 billion of various forms of long-term debt and preferred
    securities.

In December 2005, UE issued, pursuant to its October 2005 SEC

Form S-3

shelf registration statement, $260 million of
    5.40% senior secured notes due February 1, 2016, with
    interest payable semi-annually on February 1 and
    August 1 of each year, beginning in August 2006. UE
    received net proceeds of $256 million, which were used to
    repay short-term debt.

UE’s debt increased $240 million in the first quarter
    of 2006 as a result of the capital lease assigned to it in
    connection with the acquisition from affiliates of NRG Energy,
    Inc., of a 640-megawatt CT facility located in Audrain County,
    Missouri. No capital was raised as a result of UE’s
    assumption of the lease obligations. See Note 2 –
    Acquisitions for further discussion of the CT facility purchase.

CIPS

In June 2005, $20 million of CIPS’ 6.49% first
    mortgage bonds matured and were retired.

In June 2006, CIPS issued and sold, pursuant to an effective SEC

Form S-3

registration statement, $61 million of 6.70% senior
    secured notes due June 15, 2036, with interest payable
    semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year,
    beginning in December 2006. These notes are secured by first
    mortgage bonds, which are subject to fallaway provisions, as
    defined in the related financing agreements. CIPS received net
    proceeds of $60 million, which were used, along with other
    funds, to repay in full CIPS’ intercompany note payable to
    UE.

Also in June 2006, $20 million of CIPS’ 7.05% first
    mortgage bonds matured and were retired.

In December 2006, CIPS repurchased all $17 million of its

Series B-1

Illinois Finance Authority bonds pursuant to a mandatory tender.
    Interest payments are being made monthly by CIPS beginning in
    January 2007. The receivable for this repurchased bond is in
    Other Current Assets on CIPS’ balance sheet.

See Note 5 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity
    regarding first mortgage bonds issued by CIPS in September 2006
    as security for its obligations under the 2006 $500 million
    credit facility.

Genco

In November 2005, $225 million of Genco’s
    7.75% senior notes matured and were retired with available
    cash and short-term borrowings.

CILCORP

In conjunction with Ameren’s acquisition of CILCORP,
    CILCORP’s long-term debt was recorded at fair value. This
    resulted in recognition of fair value adjustment increases of
    $71 million related to CILCORP’s 9.375% senior
    bonds due 2029 and $40 million related to its
    8.70% senior notes due 2009. Amortization related to these
    fair value adjustments was $6 million, $7 million, and
    $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005, and 2004, respectively, and costs related to repayments
    during the year were $2 million, $8 million, and
    $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005, and 2004, respectively. These amounts were included in
    interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income of
    Ameren and CILCORP.

In 2005, CILCORP repurchased $74 million in principal
    amount of its 8.70% senior notes due 2009.

In March 2006, CILCORP repurchased $2 million in principal
    amount of its 9.375% senior bonds due 2029, and in April
    2006, CILCORP repurchased an additional $7 million in
    principal amount of these bonds.

See Note 5 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity
    regarding CILCORP’s pledge of the common stock of CILCO as
    security for its obligations under the 2006 $500 million
    credit facility and the 2007 $500 million credit facility.

CILCO

In both July 2006 and July 2005, CILCO redeemed
    11,000 shares of its 5.85% Class A preferred stock at
    a redemption price of $100 per share plus accrued and
    unpaid dividends. These redemptions satisfied CILCO’s
    mandatory



sinking fund redemption requirement for this series of preferred
    stock for 2006 and 2005.

In December 2005, $16 million of CILCO’s 6.13% first
    mortgage bonds matured and were retired.

In June 2006, CILCO issued and sold, with registration rights in
    a private placement, $54 million of 6.20% senior
    secured notes due June 15, 2016, and $42 million of
    6.70% senior secured notes due June 15, 2036, both
    with interest payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15
    of each year, beginning in December 2006. These notes are
    secured by first mortgage bonds, which are subject to fallaway
    provisions as defined in the related financing agreements. CILCO
    received total net proceeds of $95 million, which were used
    to reduce short-term money pool borrowings and, in July 2006, to
    redeem CILCO’s $20 million 7.73% secured medium-term
    notes due 2025. CILCO commenced the offer to exchange registered
    secured notes for the outstanding unregistered senior secured
    notes under the related registration rights agreement on
    October 18, 2006, and all of the bonds were exchanged on or
    before November 16, 2006. In January 2007, $50 million
    of CILCO’s 7.50% first mortgage bonds matured and were
    retired. See Note 5 – Credit Facilities and
    Liquidity regarding first mortgage bonds issued by CILCO in
    September 2006 as security for its obligations under the 2006
    $500 million credit facility and the mortgage and security
    interest in its power plants issued by AERG as security for its
    obligations under the 2006 $500 million credit facility and
    the 2007 $500 million credit facility.

IP

In conjunction with Ameren’s acquisition of IP, IP’s
    long-term debt was increased to fair value by $195 million.
    Amortization related to fair value adjustments was
    $13 million, $16 million, and $14 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    respectively, and was included in interest expense in the
    consolidated statements of income of Ameren and IP.

In November 2004, pursuant to an equity clawback provision in
    the related bond indenture, IP redeemed $192.5 million
    principal amount of its 11.50% series mortgage bonds due 2010.
    The redemption price was equal to $1,115 per $1,000
    principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Also in
    November 2004, IP completed a cash tender offer for
    $351 million of these bonds. The tender offer consideration
    paid was $1,214 per $1,000 principal amount plus accrued
    and unpaid interest. This tender offer satisfied IP’s
    indenture obligation to offer to purchase the bonds resulting
    from the change of control of IP upon its acquisition by Ameren.
    In December 2004, IP repurchased an additional $6.5 million
    principal amount of these bonds at a redemption price of
    $1,207 per $1,000 principal amount plus accrued unpaid
    interest. On December 15, 2006, IP redeemed the remaining
    $33,000 principal amount of these bonds.

In March 2005, $70 million of IP’s 6.75% mortgage
    bonds matured and were retired with available cash.

In June 2006, IP issued and sold, with registration rights in a
    private placement, $75 million of 6.25% senior secured
    notes due June 15, 2016, with interest payable
    semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year,
    beginning in December 2006. These notes are secured by mortgage
    bonds, which are subject to fallaway provisions as defined in
    the related financing agreements. IP received net proceeds of
    $74 million, which were used to reduce short-term money
    pool borrowings. IP commenced the offer to exchange registered
    secured notes for the outstanding unregistered senior secured
    notes under the related registration rights agreement on
    October 18, 2006, and all of the bonds were exchanged on or
    before November 16, 2006.

See Note 5 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity
    regarding mortgage bonds issued by IP in September 2006 as
    security for its obligations under the 2006 $500 million
    credit facility.

In December 1998, the IP SPT issued $864 million of TFNs,
    as allowed under the Illinois Electric Utility Transition
    Funding Law. In accordance with the Transitional Funding
    Securitization Financing Agreement, IP must designate a portion
    of the cash received from customer billings to fund payment of
    the TFNs. The amounts received are remitted to the IP SPT and
    are restricted for the sole purpose of paying down the TFNs. Due
    to the adoption of FIN No. 46R and resulting
    deconsolidation of IP SPT, restricted cash associated with
    amounts collected is netted against the current portion of
    IP’s long-term debt payable to IP SPT on IP’s
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, consolidated balance sheets.

EEI

In December 2005, $8 million and $7 million of
    EEI’s 6.61% and 8.60% senior medium-term notes,
    respectively, matured and were retired.



Indenture
    Provisions and Other Covenants

UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s indenture
    provisions and articles of incorporation include covenants and
    provisions related to the issuances of first mortgage bonds and
    preferred stock. The following table includes the required and

In addition, UE’s mortgage indenture contains certain
    provisions that restrict the amount of common dividends that can
    be paid by UE. Under this mortgage indenture, $31 million
    of total retained earnings was restricted against payment of
    common dividends, except those dividends payable in common
    stock, which left $1.7 billion of free and unrestricted
    retained earnings at December 31, 2006.

The IP SPT TFNs contain restrictions that prohibit IP LLC from
    making any loan or advance to, or certain investments in, any
    other person. Also, as long as the TFNs are outstanding, the IP
    SPT shall not, directly or indirectly, pay any dividend or make
    any distribution (by reduction of capital or otherwise) to any
    owner of a beneficial interest in the IP SPT.

The restrictions on the ability of IP to declare and pay
    dividends on its common stock that were established by the ICC
    order approving Ameren’s acquisition of IP terminated in
    December 2006 with IP’s redemption of the remaining $33,000
    of its 11.50% series mortgage bonds due 2010.

Genco’s and CILCORP’s indentures include provisions
    that require the companies to maintain certain debt service
    coverage and

debt-to-capital

ratios in order for the companies to pay dividends, to make
    certain principal or interest payments, to make certain loans to
    affiliates, or to incur additional indebtedness. The following
    table summarizes these ratios for the 12 months ended
    December 31, 2006:

Genco’s ratio restrictions under its indenture may be
    disregarded if both Moody’s and S&P reaffirm the
    ratings of Genco in place at the time of the debt incurrence
    after considering the additional indebtedness. In the event
    CILCORP is not in compliance with these tests, CILCORP may make
    such payments of dividends or intercompany loans if its senior
    long-term debt rating is at least BB+ from S&P, Baa2 from
    Moody’s, and BBB from Fitch. At December 31, 2006,
    CILCORP’s senior long-term debt ratings from S&P,
    Moody’s and Fitch were BB+, Ba1, and BBB+, respectively.
    The common stock of CILCO is pledged as security to the holders
    of CILCORP’s senior notes, and credit facility obligations.



In order for the Ameren Companies to issue securities in the
    future, they will have to comply with any applicable tests in
    effect at the time of any such issuances.

Off-Balance-Sheet
    Arrangements

At December 31, 2006, none of the Ameren Companies had any
    off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, other than operating
    leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. None of
    the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant
    off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in the near future.

NOTE 8 –
    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in
    market prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity, and emission
    allowances. Price fluctuations in natural gas, fuel, and
    electricity cause any of the following:

•

an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted
    commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sale prices
    under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices;

•

market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased
    power that differ from the cost of those commodities in
    inventory; or

•

actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that
    differ from anticipated cash outlays.

The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by
    our risk management policies for forward contracts, futures,
    options, and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed
    within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new
    or offsetting transactions are required. The goal of the hedging
    program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring
    that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements.

Certain derivative contracts are entered into on a regular basis
    as part of our risk management program but do not qualify for
    hedge accounting or the normal purchase and sales exceptions
    under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended.
    Accordingly, such contracts are recorded at fair value with
    changes in the fair value charged or credited to the income
    statement in the period in which the change occurred. Contracts
    we enter into as part of our risk management program may be
    settled financially, by physical delivery, or net settled with
    the counterparty.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

Our risk management processes identify the relationships between
    hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk
    management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
    transactions. The

mark-to-market

value of cash flow hedges will continue to fluctuate with
    changes in market prices up to contract expiration.

We monitor and value derivative positions daily as part of our
    risk management processes. We use published sources for pricing
    when possible to mark positions to market. We rely on modeled
    valuations only when no other method exists.

The pretax net gain or loss on power hedges is included in
    Operating Revenues – Electric, and the pretax net gain
    or loss on hedges related to
    SO


emission allowances, fuel or power supply, and natural gas are
    included in Operating Expenses – Fuel and Purchased
    Power. This pretax net gain or loss represents the impact of
    discontinued cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of cash
    flow hedges, and the reversal of amounts previously recorded in
    OCI due to transactions being delivered or settled, resulting in
    a $7 million gain for Ameren, a $5 million gain for
    UE, a $2 million loss for IP and a $1 million loss for
    Genco for the year ended December 31, 2006
    (2005 – $6 million gain for Ameren, less than a
    $1 million gain for UE, and a $1 million gain for
    Genco); 2004 – $3 million gain for Ameren and
    Genco).



The following table presents the carrying value of all
    derivative instruments and the amount of pretax net gains on

Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO
    and IP have been granted FTRs associated with the MISO Day Two
    Energy Market. Marketing Company has acquired FTRs for its
    participation in the PJM-Northern Illinois portion of the
    market. The FTRs are intended to hedge electric transmission
    congestion charges related to our delivery of electricity.
    Depending on the congestion on the electric transmission grid
    and prices at various points on such grid, FTRs could result in
    either charges or credits. We use complex grid modeling tools to
    determine which FTRs we wish to nominate in the FTR allocation
    process. There is a risk that we may incorrectly model the
    amount of FTRs we need, and there is the potential that some of
    the FTR hedges could be ineffective. FTRs are considered
    derivatives. The valuation of FTRs is complex due to the lack of
    available historical market data. As of December 31, 2006,
    the net value of FTRs held by the Ameren Companies was
    determined to be immaterial.



NOTE 9 –
    STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN AND PREFERRED STOCK

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

Ameren’s board of directors has adopted a share purchase
    rights plan designed to assure stockholders of fair and equal
    treatment in the event of a proposed takeover. The rights are
    exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15% or more of
    Ameren’s outstanding common stock or announces a tender
    offer that would result in ownership by a person or group of 15%
    or more of the Ameren common stock. Each right will entitle the
    holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a newly issued preferred
    stock at an exercise price of $180. If a person or group
    acquires 15% or more of Ameren’s outstanding common stock,
    each right will entitle its holder (other than such person or
    members of such group) to purchase, at the right’s
    then-current exercise price, a number of Ameren’s common
    shares having a market value of twice such price. In addition,
    if Ameren is acquired in a merger or other business combination
    transaction after a person or group has acquired 15% or more of
    Ameren’s outstanding common stock, each right will entitle
    its holder to purchase, at the right’s then-current
    exercise price, a number of the acquiring company’s common
    shares having a market value of twice such price. The acquiring
    person or group will not be entitled to exercise these rights.
    These rights expire in 2008. One right will accompany each new
    share of Ameren common stock prior to such expiration date.

Preferred
    Stock

All classes of UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s
    preferred stock are entitled to cumulative dividends and have
    voting rights. Ameren has 100 million shares of
    $0.01 par value preferred stock authorized, with no shares
    outstanding. CIPS has 2.6 million shares of no par value
    preferred stock authorized, with no shares outstanding. UE has
    7.5 million shares authorized of $1 par value
    preference stock and CILCO has 2 million shares authorized
    of no par value preference stock, with no such preference stock
    outstanding. IP has 5 million shares authorized of no par
    value serial preferred stock and 5 million shares
    authorized of no par value preference stock, with no such serial
    preferred stock and preference stock outstanding. No shares of
    preference stock have been issued by any of the Ameren Companies.

The following table presents the outstanding preferred stock of
    UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP that is not subject to mandatory

NOTE 10 –
    RETIREMENT BENEFITS

We offer defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans
    covering substantially all employees of UE, CIPS, CILCORP,
    CILCO, IP, EEI and Ameren Services and certain employees of
    Resources Company and its subsidiaries, including Genco. Ameren
    uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and
    postretirement benefit plans.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006, signed by President Bush in
    August 2006, will affect the manner in which companies
    administer their pension plans. This legislation increases the
    funding target for qualified plans, increases the level of
    retirement benefit security over time and reduces the financial
    exposure of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC),
    among other things. Ameren does not anticipate a material impact
    on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity
    at this time.

We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),” effective
    December 31, 2006. SFAS No. 158 requires
    employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded positions
    of defined benefit postretirement plans, including pension
    plans, as an asset or liability in their balance sheets and to
    recognize as a component of OCI, net of tax, the gains or losses
    and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period
    but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit
    cost. The



following table presents the incremental effect of applying
    SFAS No. 158 to individual line items in Ameren’s
    consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006.

Ameren adopted FSP

SFAS 106-2

“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
    Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
    2003,” during the second quarter of 2004, retroactive to
    January 1, 2004, which resulted in the recognition of a
    federal subsidy for postretirement benefit costs related to
    prescription drug benefits. The effect of this subsidy was a
    reduction of various components of Ameren’s and principally
    UE’s net periodic postretirement benefit costs. Interest
    costs were reduced by $4 million, and amortization of
    losses was reduced by $7 million. The impact of the subsidy
    on the expected return on plan assets was minimal.

Investment
    Strategy and Return on Asset Assumption

The primary objective of the Ameren retirement plan and
    postretirement benefit plans is to provide eligible employees
    with pension and postretirement health care benefits. Ameren
    manages plan assets in accordance with the “prudent
    investor” guidelines contained in ERISA. Ameren’s goal
    is to earn the highest possible return on plan assets consistent
    with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates investment
    management to specialists in each asset class. Where
    appropriate, Ameren provides the investment manager with
    guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment
    types. Ameren regularly monitors manager performance and
    compliance with investment guidelines.

The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and
    projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes
    in the investment portfolio. Assumed projected rates of return
    for each asset class were selected after an analysis of
    historical experience, future expectations, and the volatility
    of the various asset classes. After considering the target asset
    allocation for each asset class, we adjusted the overall
    expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and
    expected experience of active portfolio management results
    compared to benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses
    paid from plan assets.

Pension benefits are based on the employees’ years of
    service and compensation. Our plans are funded in compliance
    with income tax regulations and federal funding requirements.
    Our policy for postretirement benefits is primarily to fund the
    Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts to
    match the annual postretirement expense.

Ameren’s current reconciliation of funded status shows
    certain amounts that will be recognized as a benefit cost in
    future years. The unrecognized losses are largely a result of
    declining discount rates over the past several years, higher
    than expected increases in medical costs, and market losses on
    plan assets.

The following table presents the cash contributions made to our
    defined benefit retirement plan qualified trusts and to our
    postretirement plans during 2006 and 2005.

(a)

Includes amounts for Ameren
    registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany
    eliminations.

Based on our assumptions at December 31, 2006, and the new
    contribution requirements in the Pension Protection Act of 2006,
    in order to maintain minimum funding levels for Ameren’s
    pension plans, we do not expect future contributions to be
    required until 2009, at which time we would expect a required
    contribution of $100 million to $150 million. Required
    contributions of $150 million to $200 million each
    year are also expected for 2010 and 2011. We expect UE’s,
    CIPS’, Genco’s, CILCO’s, and IP’s portion of
    the future funding requirements to be 61%, 10%, 11%, 7%, and
    11%, respectively. These amounts are estimates. They may change
    with actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates,
    any pertinent changes in government regulations, and any
    voluntary contributions.



Ameren uses plan actuaries to determine discount rate
    assumptions. Ameren’s actuaries have developed an interest
    rate yield curve to make judgments pursuant to EITF

No. D-36,

“Selection of Discount Rates Used for Measuring Defined
    Benefit Pension Obligations and Obligations of Postretirement
    Benefit Plans Other Than Pensions.” The yield curve is
    constructed based on the yields of more than 500 high-quality,
    noncallable corporate bonds with maturities between zero and
    30 years. A theoretical spot-rate curve constructed from
    this yield curve is then used to discount the annual benefit
    cash flows of the Ameren pension plan and postretirement plans
    and to develop a single-point discount rate matching the
    plans’ payout structure.

In determining the current year market-related asset value, the
    prior year market-related value of assets is adjusted by
    contributions, disbursements, and expected return, plus 25% of
    the actual return in excess of (or less than) expected return
    for the four prior years.

Ameren and CIPS sponsor 401(k) plans for eligible employees. The
    CIPS 401(k) plan is available only to employees represented by
    IBEW Local 702. All other CIPS employees are eligible to
    participate in the Ameren 401(k) plan. The former CIPS IUOE
    Local 148 plan was merged into the Ameren plan during the first
    quarter of 2005. IP employees began participating in the Ameren
    plan during the fourth quarter of 2004. The former CILCO plan
    was merged into the Ameren plan at the beginning of 2004. The
    plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their base pay
    in accordance with specific guidelines. Ameren and CIPS match a
    percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits.
    Ameren’s matching contribution to the 401(k) plan totaled
    $19 million and $18 million in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Ameren’s and IP’s matching contributions
    to the 401(k) plans totaled $15 million and $2 million
    (predecessor), respectively, in 2004. CIPS’ matching
    contributions to its 401(k) plan were less than $1 million
    annually in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

The following table presents the portion of the 401(k) matching
    contribution to the Ameren plan for each of the Ameren Companies

NOTE 11 –
    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Ameren’s long-term incentive plan for eligible employees,
    called the Long-term Incentive Plan of 1998 (1998 Plan) was
    replaced prospectively by the 2006 Omnibus Incentive
    Compensation Plan (2006 Plan) effective May 2, 2006. The
    2006 Plan provides for a maximum number of 4 million common
    shares available for grant to eligible employees and directors.
    No new awards may be granted under the 1998 Plan; however,
    previously granted awards continue to vest or to be exercisable
    in accordance with their original terms and conditions. The 2006
    Plan awards may be stock options, stock appreciation rights,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares,
    performance share units, cash-based awards, and other
    stock-based awards.

Includes 220,003 performance share
    units (share units) granted to certain executive and
    nonexecutive officers and other eligible employees in February
    2006 under the 1998 Plan and 130,637 share units granted in
    February 2006 under the 2006 Plan to certain executive officers
    subject to shareholder approval, which was obtained on
    May 2, 2006. The share units granted under the 2006 Plan
    were not considered as granted until approved by shareholders.
    Accordingly, compensation expense recognition for these awards
    commenced in May 2006.

(b)

Share units issued under the 1998
    Plan vested due to deaths of employees and attainment of
    retirement eligibility by certain employees. Actual shares
    issued for retirement-eligible employees will vary depending on
    actual performance over the three-year measurement period.

Ameren recorded compensation expense of $11 million,
    $6 million and $5 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and a
    related tax benefit of $1 million, $2 million and
    $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
    and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, total
    compensation cost of $19 million related to nonvested
    awards not yet recognized is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of three years.

Performance Share
    Units

A share unit will vest and entitle an employee to receive shares
    of Ameren common stock (plus accumulated dividends) if, at the
    end of the three-year performance period, Ameren has achieved
    certain performance goals and the individual remains employed by
    Ameren. The exact number of shares issued pursuant to a share
    unit will vary from 0% to 200% of the target award depending on
    actual company performance relative to the performance goals. If
    a share unit vests, Ameren will issue the related shares to the
    employee two years after vesting, but dividends on the shares
    will be paid to the employee at the same time they are paid to
    other shareholders.

The fair value of each share unit awarded in February 2006 under
    the 1998 Plan was determined to be $56.07 based on Ameren’s
    closing common share price of $50.69 per share at the grant
    date and lattice simulations used to estimate expected share
    payout based on Ameren’s attainment of certain financial
    measures relative to the designated peer group. The significant
    assumptions used to calculate fair value also included a
    three-year risk-free rate of 4.65%, dividend yields of 2.3% to
    4.6% for the peer group, volatility of 13.87% to 22.45% for the
    peer group, and Ameren’s maintenance of its $2.54 annual
    dividend over the performance period. The fair value of each
    share unit granted in May 2006 under the 2006 Plan was
    determined to be $56.07 based on assumptions similar to the
    February 2006 grant.

Restricted
    Stock

Restricted stock awards in Ameren common stock were granted
    under the 1998 Plan from 2001 to 2005. Restricted shares have
    the potential to vest over a seven-year period from the date of
    grant if the company achieves certain performance levels. An
    accelerated vesting provision included in this plan reduces the
    vesting period from seven years to three years if the earnings
    growth rate exceeds a prescribed level. During 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, 154,086 and 135,340 restricted stock awards were
    granted. The weighted-average fair value for restricted stock
    awards granted was $51.21 per share in 2005 and
    $46.34 per share in 2004. We record compensation expense
    over the vesting period.

Stock
    Options

Ameren

Options in Ameren common stock were granted under the 1998 Plan
    at a price not less than the fair-market value of the common
    shares at the date of grant. Granted options vest over a period
    of five years, beginning at the date of grant, and they permit
    accelerated exercising upon the occurrence of certain events,
    including retirement. There have not been any stock options
    granted since December 31, 2000. Outstanding options of
    106,212 at December 31, 2006, expire on various dates
    through 2010. Ameren applied APB Opinion No. 25 in
    accounting for our stock-based compensation for years prior to
    2003. Effective January 1, 2003, Ameren prospectively
    adopted accounting for our stock-based compensation plans using
    the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123.
    Options granted prior to the SFAS 123 adoption were fully
    expensed during 2004. Therefore, there is no expense from stock
    options for the years ended December 31, 2006, and
    December 31, 2005. See Note 1 – Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies for further information.

Ameren, Genco, CILCORP and IP have Illinois net operating loss
    carryforwards of $424 million, $2 million,
    $204 million and $203 million, respectively. These
    will begin to expire in 2016.

Upon Ameren’s acquisition of IP, IP’s net accumulated
    deferred income tax liabilities and unamortized accumulated
    investment tax credits were eliminated.

NOTE 13 —
    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Ameren Companies have engaged in, and may in the future
    engage in, affiliate transactions in the normal course of
    business. These transactions primarily consist of gas and power
    purchases and sales, services received or rendered, and
    borrowings and lendings. Transactions between affiliates are
    reported as intercompany transactions on their financial
    statements, but are eliminated in consolidation for
    Ameren’s financial statements. Below are the material
    related-party agreements.

Electric Power
    Supply Agreements

Under two electric power supply agreements, which expired or
    terminated December 31, 2006, Genco was obliged to supply
    power to Marketing Company. Marketing Company, in turn, was
    obliged to supply to CIPS all of the energy and capacity CIPS
    needed to offer service for resale to its native load customers
    at ICC-regulated rates and to fulfill its other obligations
    under all applicable federal and state tariffs or contracts. Any
    power not used by CIPS was sold by Marketing Company under
    various long-term wholesale and retail contracts. For native
    load, CIPS paid an annual capacity charge per megawatt for its
    forecasted peak demand or actual demand, whichever was greater,
    plus an energy charge per megawatthour to Marketing Company. For
    fixed-price retail customers outside of the tariff, CIPS paid
    Marketing Company the price it received under these contracts.
    The fees paid by CIPS to Marketing Company for native load and
    fixed-price retail customers and any other sales by Marketing
    Company under various long-term wholesale and retail contracts
    were passed through to



Genco. In addition, under the power supply agreement between
    Genco and Marketing Company, Genco bore all generation-related
    operating risks, including plant performance, operations,
    maintenance, efficiency, employee retention, and other matters.
    There were no guarantees, bargain purchase options, or other
    terms that conveyed to CIPS the right to use the property and
    plant of Genco.

In October 2003, in conjunction with CILCO’s transfer to
    AERG of substantially all of its generating assets, AERG entered
    into an electric power supply agreement to supply CILCO with
    sufficient power to meet its native load requirements. CILCO
    paid a monthly capacity charge per megawatt based on its system
    capacity requirements, plus an energy charge per megawatthour.
    This agreement expired on December 31, 2006. Also in
    conjunction with CILCO’s generating asset transfer, a
    bilateral power supply agreement was entered into between AERG
    and Marketing Company. This agreement provided for AERG to sell
    excess power to Marketing Company for sales outside the CILCO
    control area, and it also allowed Marketing Company to sell
    power to AERG to fulfill CILCO’s native load requirements.

In December 2006, Genco and Marketing Company entered into a new
    power supply agreement (Genco PSA) whereby Genco will sell and
    Marketing Company will purchase all of the capacity available
    from Genco’s generation fleet and such amount of associated
    energy. The Genco PSA provides that Marketing Company shall pay,
    for each megawatthour of associated energy delivered by Genco
    and purchased by Marketing Company during the month of delivery,
    an “energy charge.” The “energy charge” is
    calculated by taking Marketing Company’s gross revenues
    with respect to power purchased from Genco and AERG in a
    particular month and subtracting from these the monthly capacity
    charge assessed on Marketing Company by Genco and AERG pursuant
    to the Genco PSA and the AERG PSA (as defined below),
    respectively. This produces the monthly net revenues. From the
    monthly net revenues, all administrative and general,
    transmission, purchased power or other expenses are subtracted
    (excluding those expenses which do not support in whole or in
    part the gross revenue associated with Genco’s generation
    pursuant to the Genco PSA or AERG’s generation pursuant to
    the AERG PSA). This amount is then divided by the total number
    of megawatthours generated by Genco and AERG to determine the
    per megawatthour “energy charge.” The Genco PSA also
    provides that Marketing Company shall pay a “monthly
    capacity charge.” The formula for determining the
    “monthly capacity charge” is based on the monthly
    fixed cost of operating the generation fleet of Genco and AERG.

Also in December 2006, AERG and Marketing Company entered into a
    power supply agreement (AERG PSA) whereby AERG will sell and
    Marketing Company will purchase all of the capacity available
    from AERG’s generation fleet and such amount of associated
    energy. The calculations of the energy charge and the monthly
    capacity charge under this agreement are substantively identical
    to those described above with respect to the Genco PSA. Both the
    Genco PSA and the AERG PSA commenced on January 1, 2007,
    and will continue through December 31, 2022, and from year
    to year thereafter unless either party elects to terminate the
    agreement by providing the other party with no less than six
    months advance written notice.

In accordance with the January 2006 ICC order discussed in
    Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, an auction
    was held in September 2006 to procure power for CIPS, CILCO and
    IP after current power supply contracts expired on
    December 31, 2006. In conjunction with the auction, there
    was a limitation of 35% on the amount of power any single
    supplier could provide of the Ameren Illinois Utilities’
    expected annual load. Ameren-affiliated companies were
    considered one supplier for the purposes of this limitation.

Through the auction, Marketing Company contracted with CIPS,
    CILCO and IP to provide power for residential and small
    commercial customers (less than one megawatt of demand) as
    follows:

    follows. By the end of 2006, nearly all of these customers
    switched to other suppliers as a result of the auction price.

UE, CIPS, IP and a nonaffiliated company were parties to a power
    supply agreement with EEI to purchase and sell capacity and
    energy. This agreement expired on December 31, 2005. Under
    a separate agreement that also expired on December 31,
    2005, CIPS resold its entitlements under the agreement with EEI
    to Marketing Company. Marketing Company and certain
    nonaffiliated companies are parties to a power supply agreement
    with Midwest Electric Power, Inc., a subsidiary of EEI, to
    purchase capacity and energy. This agreement’s term is

year-to-year

on a calendar basis, unless the purchasing parties unanimously
    agree to terminate their participation. In December 2005,
    Marketing Company entered into a power supply agreement with
    EEI, effective January 2006, whereby EEI will sell 100% of its
    capacity and energy to Marketing Company. This agreement expires
    on December 31, 2015.



UE had a 150-megawatt power supply agreement with Marketing
    Company that expired May 31, 2005. Power supplied by
    Marketing Company to UE through this agreement was obtained from
    Genco.

In December 2004, Marketing Company and IP entered into an
    agency agreement that authorized Marketing Company, on behalf of
    IP, to sell or purchase, as necessary, electric energy and
    capacity in the wholesale market for 2005 and 2006.

IP had a contract that expired at the end of 2004 with a former
    affiliate, DMG, to supply power via purchase agreements. The
    purchased power agreement with DMG obliged DMG to provide power
    to IP up to the reservation amount, and at the same prices, even
    if DMG had individual units unavailable at various times.

IP was party to several commercial and industrial electric and
    gas sales agreements with DMG, which were entered into before
    Ameren’s acquisition of IP. These were typically yearly
    contracts that renewed automatically unless cancelled by either
    party with a

30-day

written notice.

Also before Ameren’s acquisition, IP purchased natural gas
    from Dynegy to serve its gas distribution business under a Gas
    Industry Standards Board master base contract that terminated
    October 1, 2004. One transaction was executed in 2004 to
    provide deliveries from January to March 2004.

Interconnection
    and Transmission Agreements

UE, CIPS and IP are parties to an interconnection agreement for
    the use of their respective transmission lines and other
    facilities for the distribution of power. In addition, CILCO and
    IP, and CILCO and CIPS, are parties to similar interconnection
    agreements. These agreements have no contractual expiration
    date, but may be terminated by any party with three years’
    notice.

IP was a party to transmission and interconnection sales
    agreements with DYPM, a former affiliate, for the use of
    IP’s transmission lines and other facilities. The
    transmission sales agreements expired in April and June 2005.
    The interconnection sales agreements expired January 1,
    2006. On October 1, 2004, pursuant to the sale of IP to
    Ameren, all continuing contracts with Dynegy and its affiliates
    became third-party agreements.

Joint Dispatch
    Agreement

Prior to December 31, 2006, UE and Genco jointly dispatched
    electric generation under a joint dispatch agreement among UE,
    CIPS and Genco. UE and Genco had the option to serve their load
    requirements from their own generation first, and then each
    could give its affiliates access to any available generation at
    incremental cost. Any excess generation not used by UE or Genco
    to serve load requirements was sold to third parties on a
    short-term basis through Ameren Energy, which served as each
    affiliate’s agent. To allocate power costs between UE and
    Genco, an intercompany sale was recorded by the company sourcing
    the power to the other company. Ameren Energy also acted as
    agent on behalf of UE and Genco to purchase power when they
    required it. As further discussed in Note 3 –
    Rate and Regulatory Matters, in January 2006, the allocation
    methodology in the JDA for margins on short-term sales of excess
    generation to third parties between UE and Genco was modified,
    and on July 7, 2006, UE, CIPS and Genco mutually consented
    to waive the one-year termination notice requirement of the JDA
    and agreed to terminate it on December 31, 2006. This
    action with respect to the JDA was accepted by the FERC in
    September 2006.

The following table presents the amount of gigawatthour sales
    under the JDA.

Support Services
    Agreements

Costs of support services provided by Ameren Services, Ameren
    Energy, and AFS to their affiliates, including wages, employee
    benefits, professional services, and other expenses are based
    on, or are an allocation of, actual costs incurred. Effective
    September 30, 2004, IP was added to the support services
    agreements with Ameren Services and AFS. Before that, IP
    operated under Dynegy’s consolidated group’s Services
    and Facilities Agreement, whereby other Dynegy affiliates
    exchanged with IP services such as financial, legal, information
    technology, and human resources, as well as shared facility
    space. IP services were exchanged at fully distributed costs,
    and revenues were not recorded under this agreement. This
    agreement was terminated in conjunction with IP’s sale to
    Ameren.

Executory
    Tolling, Gas Sales, and Transportation Agreements

Under an executory tolling agreement, CILCO purchases steam,
    chilled water, and electricity from Medina Valley. In connection
    with this agreement, Medina Valley purchases gas to fuel its
    generating facility from AFS under a fuel supply and services
    agreement.

Under a gas transportation agreement, Genco acquires gas
    transportation service from UE for its Columbia, Missouri, CTs.
    This agreement expires in February 2016.

Note Receivable
    from Former Affiliate

In September 2004, IP’s $2.3 billion note receivable
    from a former affiliate was eliminated in connection with the
    sale of IP to Ameren. In January 2004, IP received an additional
    interest prepayment of $43 million. These notes contained
    payment provisions pursuant to which semi-



annual interest payments of $86 million were due on
    April 1 and October 1 of each year.

Transitional
    Funding Securitization Financing Agreement

IP’s financial statements include related party
    transactions with IP SPT, its wholly owned unconsolidated
    subsidiary, which was deconsolidated in accordance with the
    adoption of FIN 46R effective on December 31, 2003. In
    accordance with the Transitional Funding Securitization
    Financing Agreement, IP must designate a portion of the cash
    received from customer billings to fund payment of the TFNs. The
    amounts received are remitted to the IP SPT and are
    restricted for the sole purpose of paying down the TFNs. Due to
    the adoption of FIN 46R and resulting deconsolidation of IP
    SPT, these amounts are netted against the current portion of
    IP’s long-term debt payable to IP SPT on IP’s
    December 31, 2006, Consolidated Balance Sheet. See
    Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies for further information.

Money
    Pools

See Note 5 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity for
    discussion of affiliate borrowing arrangements.

Intercompany
    Promissory Notes

In November 2004, Genco made a $75 million principal
    prepayment under its note payable to CIPS. The note payable to
    CIPS was issued in conjunction with the transfer of CIPS’
    electric generating assets and related liabilities to Genco. On
    May 1, 2005, Genco and CIPS amended the maturity date and
    interest rate of the subordinated note payable to CIPS. Genco
    issued to CIPS an amended and restated subordinated promissory
    note in the principal amount of $249 million with an
    interest rate of 7.125% per year, a

5-year

amortization schedule, and a maturity date of May 1, 2010.
    Interest income and expense for this note recorded by CIPS and
    Genco, respectively, was $12 million, $15 million, and
    $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005, and 2004, respectively.

Also on May 1, 2005, the remaining principal balance under
    Genco’s note payable to Ameren of $34 million was
    repaid. Genco recorded interest expense of $1 million and
    $2 million from this note payable to Ameren for the years
    ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

On May 2, 2005, CIPS issued to UE a subordinated promissory
    note in the principal amount of $67 million as
    consideration for 50% of UE’s Illinois-based utility assets
    transferred to CIPS on that date. The note bore interest at
    4.70% per year and had a five-year amortization schedule
    and a maturity date of May 2, 2010. In June 2006, CIPS
    repaid in full the remaining balance under this note. UE and
    CIPS recorded interest income and expense, respectively, of
    $1 million and $2 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2005, respectively.

CILCORP has been granted authority by the FERC in a 2006 order
    to borrow up to $250 million directly from Ameren. The
    outstanding borrowings were $73 million and
    $186 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The average interest rate on these borrowings was
    4.65% for the year ended December 31, 2006
    (2005 – 5.48%). CILCORP recorded interest expense of
    $7 million, $6 million, and $5 million for these
    borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
    2004 respectively.

Operating
    Leases

Under an operating lease agreement, Genco is leasing certain CTs
    at a Joppa, Illinois, site to its parent, Development Company,
    for an initial term of 15 years, expiring
    September 30, 2015. Development Company, upon satisfaction
    of certain conditions, has the option to renew this lease for up
    to two consecutive five-year renewal terms. Genco recorded
    operating revenues from the lease agreement of $11 million,
    $10 million, and $10 million for the three years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Under an
    electric power supply agreement with Marketing Company,
    Development Company supplies the capacity and energy from these
    leased units to Marketing Company, which in turn supplies the
    energy to Genco.



The following table presents the impact on UE, CIPS, Genco,
    CILCORP, CILCO, and IP of related party transactions for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. It is based
    primarily on the agreements discussed above and the money pool
    arrangements discussed in Note 5 – Credit
    Facilities and Liquidity.

NOTE 14 –
    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

As a result of issues generated in the course of daily business,
    we are involved in legal, tax and regulatory proceedings before
    various courts, regulatory commissions, and governmental
    agencies, some of which involve substantial amounts of money. We
    believe that the final disposition of these proceedings, except
    as otherwise disclosed in these notes to our financial
    statements, will not have an adverse material effect on our
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Callaway Nuclear
    Plant

The following table presents insurance coverage at UE’s
    Callaway nuclear plant at December 31, 2006. The property
    and liability coverages were renewed on October 1, 2005 and

Price-Anderson limits the liability for claims from an incident
    involving any licensed United States nuclear facility. The limit
    is based on the number of licensed reactors and is adjusted at
    least every five years to reflect changes in the Consumer Price
    Index. Utilities owning a nuclear reactor cover this exposure
    through a combination of private insurance and mandatory
    participation in a financial protection pool, as established by
    Price-Anderson.



If losses from a nuclear incident at the Callaway nuclear plant
    exceed the limits of, or are not subject to, insurance, or if
    coverage is unavailable, UE self-insures the risk. If a serious
    nuclear incident occurred, it could have a material but
    indeterminable adverse effect on our results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

(c)

At December 31, 2006, less
    than one million dollars of electric capacity contracts were
    executed for the Ameren Illinois Utilities with approximately
    23% of the capacity resources dedicated to CIPS, 7% to CILCO,
    and 70% to IP. These capacity purchases were made to serve
    real-time pricing customers (one megawatt of demand or higher).
    The majority of the electric capacity for the Illinois utilities
    was obtained through the Illinois power procurement auction. See
    below for additional information.

(d)

Commitments for natural gas
    purchases for CILCO and IP include projected synthetic natural
    gas purchases pursuant to a

20-year

supply contract beginning in April 2011.

Commencing January 1, 2007, CIPS, CILCO and IP are required
    to obtain all electric supply requirements for customers that do
    not purchase electric supply from third-party suppliers through
    the Illinois power procurement auction. See
    Note 3 – Rate and Regulatory Matters for
    information on the Illinois power procurement auction and
    related matters, including pending court appeals that challenge
    the auction process and the recovery by utilities through rates
    to customers of costs for power supply resulting from the
    auction.

CIPS, CILCO and IP entered into power supply contracts with
    winning bidders of the Illinois power procurement auction held
    in September 2006. As of January 1, 2007, the power supply
    contracts stipulate terms of 17 months, 29 months, and
    41 months to serve the electric load requirements of
    fixed-price residential and small commercial customers (with
    less than one megawatt of demand). CIPS, CILCO and IP obtained

17-month-term

electric power supply contracts with winning bidders in the
    auction to serve the load requirements of commercial and
    industrial fixed-price customers (with one megawatt or greater
    demand) commencing January 1, 2007. Under these contracts,
    the electric suppliers are responsible for providing to CIPS,
    CILCO and IP energy, capacity, certain transmission, volumetric
    risk management, and other services necessary for the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities to serve the load of customers at an
    all-inclusive fixed price.

Through the Illinois auction held in September 2006, CIPS, CILCO
    and IP contracted for their anticipated fixed-price loads for
    residential and small commercial customers (less than one
    megawatt of demand) as follows:

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations by
    federal, state and local authorities. From the beginning phases
    of siting and development to the ongoing operation of existing
    or new electric generating, transmission and distribution
    facilities, and natural gas storage plants, transmission and
    distribution facilities, our activities involve compliance with
    diverse laws and regulations. These laws and regulations address
    noise, emissions, and impacts to air and water, protected and
    cultural resources (such as wetlands, endangered species, and
    archeological and historical resources), and chemical and waste
    handling. Our activities often require complex and lengthy
    processes as we obtain approvals, permits or licenses for new,
    existing or modified facilities. Additionally, the use and
    handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials (including
    wastes) requires preparation of release prevention plans and
    emergency response procedures. As new laws or regulations are
    promulgated, we assess their applicability and implement the
    necessary modifications to our facilities or our operations, as
    required. The more significant matters are discussed below.



Clean Air
    Act

In May 2005, the EPA issued final regulations with respect to
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions
    (the Clean Air Mercury Rule) from coal-fired power plants. The
    new rules require significant reductions in these emissions from
    UE, Genco, AERG and EEI power plants in phases, beginning in
    2009. States are required to finalize rules to implement the
    federal Clean Air Interstate Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule.
    Although the federal rules mandate a specific cap for
    SO


,
    NO

x

and mercury emissions by state from utility boilers, the states
    have considerable flexibility in allocating emission allowances
    to individual utility boilers. In addition, a state may choose
    to hold back certain emission allowances for growth or other
    reasons, and it may implement a more stringent program than the
    federal program. Illinois has proposed rules to implement the
    federal Clean Air Interstate Rule program; however it is
    anticipated that the rules will not be finalized until the
    second quarter of 2007.

The Missouri Department of Natural Resources formally proposed
    rules to implement the federal Clean Air Mercury and Clean Air
    Interstate Rules in November 2006. These rules substantially
    follow the federal rules. In December 2006, the Missouri Air
    Conservation Commission held a public hearing on these proposed
    rules. The Missouri Air Conservation Commission approved the
    rules at their February 2007 meeting. The rules will be
    effective after publication in the Missouri Register targeted
    for April 2007. The rules will also need to be approved by the
    EPA. When they are fully implemented, it is estimated that these
    rules will reduce mercury emissions 81% by 2018 and reduce
    NO

x

emissions 30% and
    SO


emissions 75% by 2015.

The Illinois EPA proposed rules for mercury that are
    significantly stricter than the federal rules. Illinois has also
    proposed Clean Air Interstate Rule program rules for
    NO

x

that are more stringent than the federal program’s. In
    2006, Genco, CILCO, EEI, and the Illinois EPA entered into an
    agreement on Illinois’ mercury regulations. Under the
    agreement, Illinois generators may delay the compliance date for
    mercury reductions in exchange for accelerated installation of
    NO

x

and
    SO


controls. The agreement with the Illinois EPA also restricts
    purchasing
    SO


and
    NO

x

emission allowances to meet specific allowed emission rates set
    forth in the agreement. The Joint Committee on Administrative
    Review approved the Illinois mercury regulations in December
    2006, and the Illinois Pollution Control Board issued a final
    order adopting the mercury regulations in late December 2006.
    The final rule was published in the Illinois Register in January
    2007. The rule will also need to be approved by the EPA. When
    they are fully implemented, it is estimated that these rules
    will reduce mercury emissions 90%,
    NO

x

emissions 50% and
    SO


emissions 70% by 2015.

The table below presents estimated capital costs based on
    current technology to comply with both (1) the federal
    Clean Air Interstate Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule through
    2016, and (2) Illinois’ mercury regulations pursuant
    to the agreement described above. The estimates described below
    could change depending upon additional federal or state
    requirements, new technology, variations in costs of material or
    labor or alternative compliance strategies, among other reasons.
    The timing of estimated capital costs may also be influenced by
    whether emission credits are used to comply with the proposed
    rules, thereby deferring capital investment.

UE’s expenditures are expected

Illinois and Missouri must also develop attainment plans to meet
    the federal

eight-hour

ozone ambient standard by June 2007 and the federal fine
    particulate ambient standard by April 2008. The costs in the
    table assume that emission controls required for the Clean Air
    Interstate Rule regulations will be sufficient to meet this new
    standard in the St. Louis region. Should Missouri develop an
    alternative plan to comply with this standard, the cost impact
    could be material to UE. Illinois is planning to impose
    additional requirements beyond the Clean Air Interstate Rule as
    part of the attainment plans for ozone and fine particulate. At
    this time, we are unable to determine the impact such state
    actions would have on our results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity.

Emission
    Credits

Both federal and state laws require significant reductions in
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions that result from burning fossil fuels. The Clean Air
    Act and
    NO

x

Budget Trading Program created marketable commodities called
    allowances. Currently each allowance gives the owner the right
    to emit one ton of
    SO


or
    NO

x

.
    All existing generating facilities have been allocated
    allowances based on past production and the statutory emission
    reduction goals. If additional allowances are needed for new
    generating facilities, they can be purchased from facilities
    that have excess allowances or from allowance banks. Our
    generating facilities comply with the
    SO


limits through the use and purchase of allowances, through the
    use of low-sulfur fuels, and through the application of
    pollution control technology. The
    NO

x

Budget Trading Program limits emissions of
    NO

x

during the ozone season (May through September). The
    NO

x

Budget Trading Program has applied to all electric generating
    units in Illinois since the beginning of 2004; it was applied to
    the eastern third of Missouri, where UE’s coal-fired power
    plants are located, beginning in 2007. Our generating facilities
    are expected to comply with the
    NO

x

limits through the use and purchase of allowances or through the
    application of pollution control technology, including
    low-NO

x

burners, over-fire air systems, combustion optimization,
    rich-reagent injection, selective noncatalytic reduction, and

    SO


and
    NO

allowances for ongoing operations. New environmental
    regulations, including the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the timing
    of the installation of pollution control equipment and the level
    of operations will have a significant impact on the amount of
    allowances actually required for ongoing operations. The Clean
    Air Interstate Rule requires a reduction in
    SO


emissions by requiring a change in the way Acid Rain Program
    allowances are surrendered. The current Acid Rain Program
    requires the surrender of one
    SO


allowance for every ton of
    SO


that is emitted. The Clean Air Interstate Rule program will
    require that
    SO


allowances be surrendered at a ratio of two allowances for every
    ton of emission in 2010 through 2014. Beginning in 2015, the
    Clean Air Interstate Rule program will require
    SO


allowances to be surrendered at a ratio of 2.86 allowances
    for every ton of emission.

Global
    Climate

Future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global
    warming are the subjects of much debate. As a result of our
    diverse fuel portfolio, our contribution to greenhouse gases
    varies. Coal-fired power plants are significant sources of
    carbon dioxide, a principal greenhouse gas. Six electric power
    sector trade associations, including the Edison Electric
    Institute, of which Ameren is a member, and the TVA, signed a
    Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the DOE in December 2004
    calling for a 3% to 5% voluntary decrease in carbon
    intensity from the utility sector between 2002 and 2012.
    Currently, Ameren is considering various initiatives to comply
    with the MOU, including enhanced generation at our nuclear and
    hydroelectric power plants, increased efficiency measures at our
    coal-fired units, and investments in renewable energy and carbon
    sequestration projects.

Ameren has taken actions to address the global climate issue.
    These include implementing efficiency improvements at our power
    plants; participating in the PowerTree Carbon Company, LLC,
    whose purpose is to reforest acreage in the lower Mississippi
    valley to sequester carbon; using coal combustion by-products as
    a direct replacement for cement, thereby reducing carbon
    emissions at cement kilns; participating in “Missouri
    Schools Going Solar,” a project that will install
    photovoltaic solar arrays on school grounds; and partnering with
    other utilities, the Electric Power Research Institute, and the
    Illinois State Geological Survey in the DOE Illinois Basin
    Initiative, which will examine the feasibility and methods of
    storing carbon dioxide within deep unused coal seams, mature oil
    fields, and saline reservoirs.

The impact of future initiatives related to greenhouse gas
    emissions and global warming on us are unknown. Although
    compliance costs are unlikely in the near future, our costs of
    complying with any mandated federal greenhouse gas program could
    have a material impact on our future results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

Clean Water
    Act

In July 2004, the EPA issued under the Clean Water Act rules
    that require cooling-water intake structures to have the best
    technology available for minimizing adverse environmental
    impacts. These rules pertain to existing generating facilities
    that currently employ a cooling-water intake structure whose
    flow exceeds 50 million gallons per day. The rules may
    require us to install additional intake screens or other
    protective measures and to do extensive site-specific study and
    monitoring. There is also the possibility that the rules may
    lead to the installation of cooling towers on some of our
    facilities. We estimate our compliance costs associated with
    conducting field studies and installing fish collection systems
    to determine the aquatic impact of our intake structures to be
    $3 million to $4 million dollars over the next three
    to four years. These studies will determine what, if any,
    additional technology must be applied at nine of our existing
    power plants. On January 25, 2007, the federal Second
    Circuit Court of Appeals remanded many provisions of these rules
    to EPA for revision. Until EPA reissues these rules and the
    studies on the power plants are completed, we will be unable to
    estimate the costs of complying with these rules. Such costs are
    not expected to be incurred prior to 2008.



New Source
    Review

The EPA has been conducting an enforcement initiative to
    determine whether modifications at a number of coal-fired power
    plants owned by electric utilities in the United States are
    subject to New Source Review requirements or New Source
    Performance Standards under the Clean Air Act. The EPA’s
    inquiries focus on whether the best available emission control
    technology was or should have been used at such power plants
    when major maintenance or capital improvements were performed.

In April 2005, Genco received a request from the EPA for
    information pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air Act
    seeking detailed operating and maintenance history data with
    respect to its Meredosia, Hutsonville, Coffeen and Newton
    facilities, EEI’s Joppa facility, and AERG’s E.D.
    Edwards and Duck Creek facilities. In December 2006, the EPA
    issued a second Section 114(a) request to Genco regarding
    projects at the Newton facility. All of these facilities are
    coal-fired power plants. The information request required Genco
    to provide responses to specific EPA questions regarding certain
    projects and maintenance activities to determine compliance with
    certain Illinois air pollution and emissions rules and with the
    New Source Performance Standard requirements of the Clean Air
    Act. These information requests are being complied with, but we
    cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

Remediation

We are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up
    hazardous waste sites as required by federal and state law. Such
    statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation
    actions regardless of degree of fault, legality of original
    disposal, or ownership of a disposal site. UE, CIPS, CILCO and
    IP have each been identified by the federal or state governments
    as a potentially responsible party at several contaminated
    sites. Several of these sites involve facilities that were
    transferred by CIPS to Genco in May 2000 and facilities
    transferred by CILCO to AERG in October 2003. As part of each
    transfer, CIPS and CILCO have contractually agreed to indemnify
    Genco and AERG for remediation costs associated with preexisting
    environmental contamination at the transferred sites.

As of December 31, 2006, CIPS, CILCO and IP owned or were
    otherwise responsible for 14, four, and 25 former MGP sites,
    respectively, in Illinois. All of these sites are in various
    stages of investigation, evaluation and remediation. Under its
    current schedule, Ameren anticipates that remediation at these
    sites should be completed by 2015. The ICC permits each company
    to recover remediation and litigation costs associated with
    their former MGP sites in Illinois from their Illinois electric
    and natural gas utility customers through environmental
    adjustment rate riders. To be recoverable, such costs must be
    prudently and properly incurred, and costs are subject to annual
    reconciliation review by the ICC. As of December 31, 2006,
    CIPS, CILCO and IP had recorded liabilities of $25 million,
    $3 million and $66 million, respectively, to represent
    estimated minimum obligations.

In addition, UE owns or is otherwise responsible for 10 MGP
    sites in Missouri and one in Iowa. UE does not currently have in
    effect in Missouri a rate rider mechanism that permits
    remediation costs associated with MGP sites to be recovered from
    utility customers. See Note 3 – Rate and
    Regulatory Matters for information on a Missouri law enabling
    the MoPSC to put in place environmental cost recovery mechanisms
    for Missouri utilities. UE does not have any retail utility
    operations in Iowa that would provide a source of recovery of
    these remediation costs. Because of the unknown and unique
    characteristics of each site (such as amount and type of
    residues present, physical characteristics of the site, and the
    environmental risk) and uncertain regulatory requirements, we
    are not able to determine the maximum liability for the
    remediation of these sites. As of December 31, 2006, UE had
    recorded $8 million to represent its estimated minimum
    obligation for its MGP sites. UE also is responsible for four
    electric sites in Missouri that have corporate cleanup
    liability, most as a result of federal agency mandates. As of
    December 31, 2006, UE had recorded $5 million to
    represent its estimated minimum obligation for these sites. At
    this time, we are unable to determine what portion of these
    costs, if any, will be eligible for recovery from insurance
    carriers.

In June 2000, the EPA notified UE and numerous other companies
    that former landfills and lagoons in Sauget, Illinois, may
    contain soil and groundwater contamination. These sites are
    known as Sauget Area 2. From about 1926 until 1976, UE operated
    a power generating facility adjacent to Sauget Area 2. UE
    currently owns a parcel of property that was used as a landfill.
    Under the terms of an Administrative Order and Consent, UE has
    joined with other potentially responsible parties to evaluate
    the extent of potential contamination with respect to Sauget
    Area 2.

In October 2002, UE was included in a Unilateral Administrative
    Order issued by the EPA listing potentially liable parties for
    groundwater contamination for a portion of the Sauget Area 2
    site. The Unilateral Administrative Order encompasses the
    groundwater contamination releasing to the Mississippi River
    adjacent to Solutia’s former chemical waste landfill and
    the resulting impact area in the Mississippi River. UE was asked
    to participate in response activities that involve the
    installation of a barrier wall around a chemical waste site and
    three recovery wells to divert groundwater flow. The projected
    cost for this remedy method is $25 million to
    $30 million. In November 2002, UE sent a letter to the EPA
    asserting its defenses to the Unilateral Administrative Order
    and requesting its removal from the list of potentially
    responsible parties under the Unilateral Administrative Order.
    Solutia agreed to comply with the Unilateral Administrative
    Order. However, in December 2003, Solutia filed for bankruptcy
    protection; it is now seeking to discharge its environmental
    liabilities. In March 2004, Pharmacia Corporation, the former
    parent company of Solutia, confirmed its intent to comply with
    the EPA’s Unilateral Administrative Order.

The status of future remediation at Sauget Area 2 and compliance
    with the Unilateral Administrative Order is



uncertain, so we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of
    the Sauget Area 2 site on our results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity. Site investigation activities have been
    performed pursuant to the oversight of the EPA and are largely
    concluded. In December 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Cooper
    Industries, Inc., vs. Aviall Services, Inc., limited the
    circumstances under which potentially responsible parties could
    assert cost-recovery claims against other potentially
    responsible parties. As a result of this ruling, it is possible
    that UE may not be able to recover from other potentially
    responsible parties the costs it incurs in complying with EPA
    orders. Any liability or responsibility that may be imposed on
    UE as a result of this Sauget, Illinois, environmental matter
    was not transferred to CIPS as a part of UE’s May 2005
    Illinois utility service territory transfer to CIPS.

In December 2004, AERG submitted a comprehensive package to the
    Illinois EPA to address groundwater and surface water issues
    associated with the recycle pond, ash ponds, and reservoir at
    the Duck Creek power plant facility. Information submitted by
    AERG is currently under review by the Illinois EPA. CILCORP and
    CILCO both have a liability of $4 million at
    December 31, 2006, included on their Consolidated Balance
    Sheets for the estimated cost of the remediation effort, which
    involves treating and discharging recycle-system water in order
    to address these groundwater and surface water issues.

In addition, our operations, or those of our predecessor
    companies, involve the use, disposal and, in appropriate
    circumstances, the cleanup of substances regulated under
    environmental protection laws. We are unable to determine the
    impact these actions may have on our results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

Pumped-storage
    Hydroelectric Facility Breach

In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at
    UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility. This
    resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which
    damaged a state park. At the FERC’s direction, outside
    experts were hired by UE to review the cause of the incident.
    Their reports and reports by FERC staff indicated design,
    construction, and human error as causes of the breach. In their
    report, UE’s outside experts concluded that restoration of
    the upper reservoir, if undertaken, will require a complete
    rebuild of the entire dam with a completely different design
    concept, not simply a repair of the breached area. FERC agreed
    with this conclusion and rejected repair as an option.

The FERC investigation of the incident has been completed. In
    October 2006, the FERC approved a stipulation and consent
    agreement between UE and the FERC’s Office of Enforcement
    that resolves all issues arising from an investigation that the
    FERC’s Office of Enforcement conducted into alleged
    violations of license conditions and FERC regulations by UE as
    the licensee of the Taum Sauk hydroelectric facility that may
    have contributed to the breach of the upper reservoir. As part
    of the stipulation and consent agreement, UE agreed, among other
    things, (1) to pay a civil penalty of $10 million,
    (2) to pay $5 million into an interest-bearing escrow
    account to fund project enhancements at or near the Taum Sauk
    facility, and (3) to implement and comply with a new dam
    safety program developed in connection with the settlement.

In February 2007, UE submitted plans and an environmental report
    to FERC to rebuild the upper reservoir at its Taum Sauk Plant,
    assuming successful resolution of outstanding issues with
    authorities of the state of Missouri. Should the decision be
    made to rebuild the Taum Sauk plant, UE would expect it to be
    out of service through at least the middle of 2009, if not
    longer.

UE has accepted responsibility for the effects of the incident.
    At this time, UE believes that substantially all damages and
    liabilities (but not penalties) caused by the breach, plus the
    cost of rebuilding the plant, will be covered by insurance. UE
    expects the total cost for clean up, damage and liabilities,
    excluding costs to rebuild the facility, resulting from the Taum
    Sauk incident to range from $131 million to
    $151 million. As of December 31, 2006, UE had paid
    $65 million and accrued a $66 million liability,
    including costs resulting from the FERC stipulation and consent
    discussed above, while expensing $30 million and recording
    a $101 million receivable due from insurance companies. As
    of December 31, 2006, UE has received $16 million from
    insurance companies, which reduces the insurance receivable
    balance to $85 million. As of December 31, 2006, UE
    had a $10 million receivable due from insurance companies
    related to rebuilding the facility. Under UE’s insurance
    policies, all claims by or against UE are subject to review by
    its insurance carriers.

In December 2006, the state of Missouri through its attorney
    general and 10 business owners filed separate lawsuits regarding
    the Taum Sauk breach. The attorney general’s suit, which
    was filed in the Missouri circuit court in St. Louis, alleges
    negligence, violations of the Missouri Clean Water Act and
    various other statutory and common law claims. The business
    owners’ suit, which was filed in the Missouri circuit court
    in Reynolds County, contains similar allegations and seeks
    damages relating to business losses and lost profit. Both suits
    seek unspecified punitive damages. In January 2007, the Missouri
    Department of Natural Resources filed a petition to intervene as
    a plaintiff in the attorney general’s lawsuit.

Until the reviews conducted by state authorities have concluded,
    litigation has been resolved, the insurance review is completed,
    a final decision about whether the plant will be rebuilt is
    made, and future regulatory treatment for the facility is
    determined, among other things, we are unable to determine the
    impact the breach may have on Ameren’s and UE’s
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity beyond
    those amounts already recognized.

Waste
    Disposal

In July 2002, the Illinois Attorney General’s Office
    advised us that it would be commencing an enforcement action
    concerning an inactive waste disposal site near Coffeen,
    Illinois. This is the location of a disposal facility that is
    permitted by the Illinois EPA to receive fly ash from



Genco’s Coffeen power plant. The Illinois attorney general
    also notified the disposal facility’s current and former
    owners about the proposed enforcement action. The Attorney
    General’s Office advised us that it may initiate an action
    under CERCLA (Superfund) to recover past costs incurred at the
    site ($0.3 million) and to obtain a declaratory judgment as
    to liability for future costs. Neither Genco, the current owner
    of the Coffeen power plant, nor CIPS, the prior owner of the
    Coffeen power plant, owned or operated the disposal facility. We
    do not expect that this matter will have a material adverse
    effect on Ameren’s, CIPS’ or Genco’s results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Sustainable
    Energy Plan

In July 2005, the ICC entered a resolution affirming the
    Illinois governor’s Sustainable Energy Plan and an ICC
    staff report dated July 7, 2005. CIPS, CILCO and IP were
    asked to file documentation explaining how they intend to
    implement the plan. The Ameren Illinois Utilities continue to
    give consideration to this plan. The plan calls for, among other
    things, a renewable portfolio standard whereby 2% of the bundled
    retail load will be supplied by renewable energy resources in
    2007, 3% in 2008, 4% in 2009, 5% in 2010, 6% in 2011, 7% in
    2012, and 8% in 2013. It also sets an energy-efficiency
    portfolio standard whereby there will be a 10% reduction in
    projected annual load growth by

2007-2008,

15% by 2009 to 2011, 20% by 2012 to 2014, and 25% by 2015 to
    2017.

Asbestos-related
    Litigation

Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been named, along
    with numerous other parties, in a number of lawsuits filed by
    plaintiffs claiming varying degrees of injury from asbestos
    exposure. Most have been filed in the circuit court of Madison
    County, Illinois. The total number of defendants named in each
    case is significant; as many as 185 parties are named in some
    pending cases and as few as six in others. However, in the cases
    that were pending as of December 31, 2006, the average
    number of parties is 68.

The claims filed against Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP
    allege injury from asbestos exposure during the plaintiffs’
    activities at our present or former electric generating plants.
    Former CIPS plants are now owned by Genco, and former CILCO
    plants are now owned by AERG. Most of IP’s plants were
    transferred to a Dynegy subsidiary prior to Ameren’s
    acquisition of IP. As a part of the transfer of ownership of the
    CIPS and CILCO generating plants, CIPS or CILCO has
    contractually agreed to indemnify Genco or AERG for liabilities
    associated with asbestos-related claims arising from activities
    prior to the transfer. Each lawsuit seeks unspecified damages in
    excess of $50,000, which, if awarded, typically would be shared
    among the named defendants.

From October 1, 2006, through December 31, 2006, four
    additional asbestos-related lawsuits were filed against UE,
    CIPS, CILCO and IP, mostly in the circuit court of Madison
    County, Illinois. Two lawsuits were dismissed and seven were
    settled. The following table presents the status as of
    December 31, 2006, of the asbestos-related lawsuits that
    have been filed against the Ameren Companies:

Addition of the numbers in the
    individual columns does not equal the total column because some
    of the lawsuits name multiple Ameren entities as defendants.

As of December 31, 2006, five asbestos-related lawsuits
    were pending against EEI. The general liability insurance
    maintained by EEI provides coverage with respect to liabilities
    arising from asbestos-related claims.

The ICC order approving Ameren’s acquisition of IP
    effective September 30, 2004, also approved a tariff rider
    to recover the costs of asbestos-related litigation claims,
    subject to the following terms. Beginning in 2007, 90% of cash
    expenditures in excess of the amount included in base electric
    rates will be recovered by IP from a $20 million trust fund
    established by IP and financed with contributions of
    $10 million each by Ameren and Dynegy. If cash expenditures
    are less than the amount in base rates, IP will contribute 90%
    of the difference to the fund. Once the trust fund is depleted,
    90% of allowed cash expenditures in excess of base rates will be
    recovered through charges assessed to customers under the tariff
    rider.

The Ameren Companies believe that the final disposition of these
    proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on their
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Regulation

Regulatory changes enacted and being considered at the federal
    and state levels continue to change the structure of the utility
    industry and utility regulation, as well as to encourage
    increased competition. At this time, we are unable to predict
    the impact of these changes on our future results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity. See Note 3 –
    Rate and Regulatory Matters for further information.

NOTE 15 –
    CALLAWAY NUCLEAR PLANT

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is
    responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent
    nuclear fuel. The DOE currently charges one mill, or 1/10 of



one cent, per nuclear-generated kilowatthour sold for future
    disposal of spent fuel. Pursuant to this act, UE collects one
    mill from its electric customers for each kilowatthour of
    electricity that it generates and sells from its Callaway
    nuclear plant. Electric utility rates charged to customers
    provide for recovery of such costs. The DOE is not expected to
    have its permanent storage facility for spent fuel available
    until at least 2017. UE has sufficient installed storage
    capacity at its Callaway nuclear plant until 2020. It has the
    capability for additional storage capacity through the licensed
    life of the plant. The delayed availability of the DOE’s
    disposal facility is not expected to adversely affect the
    continued operation of the Callaway nuclear plant through its
    currently licensed life.

Electric utility rates charged to customers provide for the
    recovery of the Callaway nuclear plant’s decommissioning
    costs, which include decontamination, dismantling, and site
    restoration costs, over an assumed

40-year

life
    of the plant, ending with the expiration of the plant’s
    operating license in 2024. It is assumed that the Callaway
    nuclear plant site will be decommissioned based on immediate
    dismantlement method and removal from service. Ameren and UE
    have recorded an ARO for the Callaway nuclear plant
    decommissioning costs at fair value, which represents the
    present value of estimated future cash outflows. Decommissioning
    costs are charged to the costs of service used to establish
    electric rates for UE’s customers. These costs amounted to
    $7 million in each of the years 2006, 2005 and 2004. Every
    three years, the MoPSC requires UE to file an updated cost study
    for decommissioning its Callaway nuclear plant. Electric rates
    may be adjusted at such times to reflect changed estimates. The
    latest study was filed in 2005. Minor tritium contamination was
    discovered on the Callaway nuclear plant site in the summer of
    2006. Existing facts and regulatory requirements indicate that
    this discovery will not cause any significant increase in a
    decommissioning cost estimate when the next study is conducted.
    Costs collected from customers are deposited in an external
    trust fund to provide for the Callaway nuclear plant’s
    decommissioning. If the assumed return on trust assets is not
    earned, we believe that it is probable that any such earnings
    deficiency will be recovered in rates. The fair value of the
    nuclear decommissioning trust fund for UE’s Callaway
    nuclear plant is reported in Nuclear Decommissioning
    Trust Fund in Ameren’s and UE’s Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. This amount is legally restricted. It may be
    used only to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. Changes
    in the fair value of the trust fund are recorded as an increase
    or decrease to the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and to a
    regulatory asset.

NOTE 16 –
    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
    fair value of each class of financial instruments for which such
    estimates are practicable to estimate that value:

Cash, Temporary
    Investments and Short-term Borrowings

The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the
    short-term maturity of these instruments.

Marketable
    Securities

The fair value is based on quoted market prices obtained from
    dealers or investment managers.

Nuclear
    Decommissioning Trust Fund

The fair value estimate is based on quoted market prices for
    securities held in the trust fund.

Long-term
    Debt

The fair value estimate is based on the quoted market prices for
    same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the
    Ameren Companies for debt of comparable maturities.

Preferred Stock
    of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP

The fair value estimate is based on the quoted market prices for
    the same or similar issues.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Market prices used to determine fair value are primarily based
    on published indices and closing exchange prices. In addition,
    valuations must rely on management’s estimates, which take
    into account time value of money and volatility factors.



The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated

UE has investments in debt and equity securities that are held
    in a trust fund for the purpose of funding the nuclear
    decommissioning of its Callaway nuclear plant. See
    Note 15 – Callaway Nuclear Plant for further
    information. We have classified these investments in debt and
    equity securities as available for sale and have recorded all
    such investments at their fair market value at December 31,
    2006 and 2005. Investments by the nuclear decommissioning trust
    fund are allocated 60% to 70% to equity securities, with the
    balance invested in fixed-income securities.

The following table presents proceeds from the sale of
    investments in UE’s nuclear decommissioning trust fund and
    the gross realized gains and losses on those sales for the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004:

    consistent with the method we use to account for the
    decommissioning costs recovered in rates. Gains or losses on
    assets in the trust fund could result in lower or higher funding
    requirements for decommissioning costs, which we believe would
    be reflected in electric rates paid by UE’s customers.

NOTE 17 –
    SEGMENT INFORMATION

Prior to the third quarter of 2006, Ameren reported one segment,
    Utility Operations, which comprised electric generation and
    electric and gas transmission and distribution operations.
    Ameren holding company activity was listed in a category called
    Other. As a result of the following changes in circumstances,
    Ameren, UE, CILCORP and CILCO changed their segments in the
    third quarter of 2006:

•

the Ameren Companies’ chief operating decision-making group
    began to assess performance and to allocate resources based on a
    new segment structure, and the group made related organizational
    and management reporting changes in the third quarter of 2006;

•

electric generation deregulation in Illinois, which became
    effective January 1, 2007;

•

the expiration of affiliate power supply agreements for CIPS and
    CILCO and other supply agreements for IP on December 31,
    2006;

•

the July 2006 termination of the JDA among UE, Genco and CIPS,
    effective December 31, 2006; and

•

the September 2006 completion of a statewide auction to procure
    power for CIPS, CILCO and IP for 2007 and beyond and Marketing
    Company’s sale in that auction of power being acquired from
    Genco and AERG.

In the third quarter of 2006, Ameren determined that it had
    three reportable segments: Missouri Regulated, Illinois
    Regulated and Non-rate-regulated Generation. The Missouri
    Regulated segment for Ameren includes all the operations of
    UE’s business as described in Note 1 –
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, except for UE’s
    40% interest in EEI and other non-rate-regulated activities,
    which are included in Other. The Illinois Regulated segment for
    Ameren consists of the regulated electric and gas transmission
    and distribution businesses of CIPS, CILCO, and IP, as described
    in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies. The Non-rate-regulated Generation segment for Ameren
    primarily consists of the operations or activities of Genco, the



CILCORP parent company, AERG, EEI, and Marketing Company. Other
    primarily includes Ameren parent company activities and the
    leasing activities of CILCORP, AERG, Resources Company, and
    CIPSCO Investment Company.

UE determined it had one reportable segment:  Missouri
    Regulated. The Missouri Regulated segment for UE includes all
    the operations of UE’s business as described in
    Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies, except for UE’s 40% interest in EEI and other
    non-rate-regulated activities, which are included in Other.

CILCORP and CILCO determined they had two reportable segments:
    Illinois Regulated and Non-rate-regulated Generation. The
    Illinois Regulated segment for CILCORP and CILCO comprises the
    regulated electric and gas transmission and distribution
    businesses of CILCO. The Non-rate-regulated Generation segment
    for CILCORP and CILCO consists of the generation business of
    AERG. Other for CILCORP and CILCO comprises leveraged lease
    investments, parent company activity, and minor activities not
    reported in the Illinois Regulated or Non-rate-regulated
    Generation segments for CILCORP.

ITEM 9. CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES.

Only Ameren, as a “large accelerated filer” with
    respect to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, was
    required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations as to management’s
    assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the
    2006 fiscal year. UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP are not
    accelerated filers. They were therefore not required to comply
    with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
    related SEC regulations as to management’s assessment of
    internal control over financial reporting for the 2006 fiscal
    year.

(a)

Evaluation of
    Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2006, evaluations were performed, under
    the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including the principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer of each of the Ameren Companies, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of such
    registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon those
    evaluations, the principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer of each of the Ameren Companies have concluded
    that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
    provide assurance that information required to be disclosed in
    such registrant’s reports filed or submitted under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
    forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to
    its management, including its principal executive and principal
    financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

(b)

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a – 15(f) and
    15d – 15(f). Under the supervision and with the
    participation of management, including the principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation was
    conducted of the effectiveness of



Ameren’s internal control over financial reporting based on
    the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Upon making
    that evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
    COSO

,

management concluded that Ameren’s internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2006. Management’s assessment of the
    effectiveness of Ameren’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in its report herein under
    Part II, Item 8.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(c)

Change in Internal
    Controls

There has been no change in the Ameren Companies’ internal
    control over financial reporting during their most recent fiscal
    quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, their internal control over financial
    reporting.

ITEM 9B. OTHER
    INFORMATION.

The Ameren Companies have no information reportable under this
    item that was required to be disclosed in a report on SEC

Form 8-K

during the fourth quarter of 2006 that has not previously been
    reported on an SEC

Form 8-K.

PART III

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS,
    EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.

Information required by Items 401, 405 and 407(d)(4) and
    (d)(5) of SEC

Regulation S-K

for Ameren will be included in its definitive proxy statement
    for its 2007 annual meeting of shareholders filed pursuant to
    SEC Regulation 14A; it is incorporated herein by reference.
    Information required by these SEC

Regulation S-K

items for UE, CIPS and CILCO will be included in each
    company’s definitive information statement for its 2007
    annual meetings of shareholders filed pursuant to SEC
    Regulation 14C; it is incorporated herein by reference.
    Information required by these SEC

Regulation S-K

items for IP is identical to the information that will be
    contained in CIPS’ definitive information statement for
    CIPS’ 2007 annual meeting of shareholders filed pursuant to
    SEC Regulation 14C; it is incorporated herein by reference.
    With respect to Genco and CILCORP, this information is omitted
    in reliance on General Instruction I (2) of

Form 10-K.

Information concerning executive officers of the Ameren
    Companies required by Item 401 of SEC

Regulation S-K

is reported under a separate caption entitled “Executive
    Officers of the Registrants” in Part I of this report.

UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP do not have separately
    designated standing audit committees, but instead use
    Ameren’s audit committee to perform such committee
    functions for their boards of directors. This arrangement is
    permitted under exemptions provided in the NYSE listing
    standards for companies such as UE and CILCO, which list only
    preferred stock (nonconvertible and nonparticipating) on the
    NYSE. CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP have no securities listed on
    the NYSE and therefore are not subject to the NYSE listing
    standards. Douglas R. Oberhelman serves as chairman of
    Ameren’s audit committee and Stephen F. Brauer, Susan
    S. Elliott, Richard A. Liddy, and Richard A. Lumpkin serve as
    members. The board of directors of Ameren has determined that
    Douglas R. Oberhelman qualifies as an audit committee financial
    expert and that he is “independent” as that term is
    used in SEC Regulation 14A.

Also, on the same basis as reported above, the boards of
    directors of UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP use the
    nominating and corporate governance committee of Ameren’s
    board of directors to perform such committee functions. This
    committee is responsible for the nomination of directors and
    corporate governance practices. Ameren’s nominating and
    corporate governance committee will consider director
    nominations from shareholders in accordance with its Policy
    Regarding Nominations of Directors, which can be found on
    Ameren’s Web site: www.ameren.com.

To encourage ethical conduct in its financial management and
    reporting, Ameren has adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to
    the principal executive officer, the principal financial
    officer, the principal accounting officer and controller, and
    the treasurer of the Ameren Companies. Ameren has also adopted a
    Code of Business Conduct that applies to the directors, officers
    and employees of the Ameren Companies, referred to as the
    Corporate Compliance Policy. The Ameren Companies make available
    free of charge through Ameren’s Web site (www.ameren.com)
    the Code of Ethics and Corporate Compliance Policy. These
    documents are also available free in print upon written request
    to Ameren Corporation, Attention: Secretary, P.O. Box 66149, St.
    Louis, Missouri

63166-6149.

Any amendment to, or waiver of, the Code of Ethics and Corporate
    Compliance Policy will be posted on Ameren’s Web site
    within four business days following the date of the amendment or
    waiver.

    and the Ameren Corporation 2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation
    Plan, which was approved by shareholders in May 2006 and expires
    on May 2, 2016. Pursuant to grants of performance share
    units (PSUs) under the Long-term Incentive Plan of 1998 and the
    2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, 366,119 of the shares
    represent PSUs at the target level of awards (including accrued
    and reinvested dividends). The actual number of shares issued in
    respect of the PSUs will vary from 0% to 200% of the target
    level based on the achievement of total shareholder return
    objectives established for such awards.

(b)

PSUs are awarded when earned in
    shares of Ameren common stock on a one-for-one basis.
    Accordingly, the PSUs have been excluded for purposes of
    calculating the weighted-average exercise price.

UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP do not have separate
