FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS

Statements in this report not based on historical facts are
    considered “forward-looking” and, accordingly, involve
    risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
    differ materially from those discussed. Although such
    forward-looking statements have been made in good faith and are
    based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that the
    expected results will be achieved. These statements include
    (without limitation) statements as to future expectations,
    beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions, and
    financial performance. In connection with the “safe
    harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995, we are providing this cautionary statement
    to identify important factors that could cause actual results to
    differ materially from those anticipated. The following factors,
    in addition to those discussed under Risk Factors and elsewhere
    in this report and in our other filings with the SEC, could
    cause actual results to differ materially from management
    expectations suggested in such forward-looking statements:

•

regulatory or legislative actions, including changes in
    regulatory policies and ratemaking determinations, such as the
    outcome of pending CIPS, CILCO and IP rate proceedings or future
    legislative actions that seek to limit or reverse rate increases;

•

uncertainty as to the effect of implementation of the Illinois
    electric settlement agreement on Ameren, the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities, Genco and AERG, including implementation of the new
    power procurement process in Illinois beginning in 2008;

•

changes in laws and other governmental actions, including
    monetary and fiscal policies;

•

changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the ability
    of electric distribution companies and other purchasers of
    wholesale electricity to pay their suppliers, including UE and
    Marketing Company;

•

enactment of legislation taxing electric generators, in Illinois
    or elsewhere;

•

the effects of increased competition in the future due to, among
    other things, deregulation of certain aspects of our business at
    both the state and federal levels, and the implementation of
    deregulation, such as occurred when the electric rate freeze and
    power supply contracts expired in Illinois at the end of 2006;

•

the effects of participation in the MISO;

•

the availability of fuel such as coal, natural gas, and enriched
    uranium used to produce electricity; the availability of
    purchased power and natural gas for distribution; and the level
    and volatility of future market prices for such commodities,
    including the ability to recover the costs for such commodities;

•

the effectiveness of risk management strategies and the use of
    financial and derivative instruments;

•

prices for power in the Midwest, including forward prices;

•

business and economic conditions, including their impact on
    interest rates;

•

disruptions of the capital markets or other events that make the
    Ameren Companies’ access to necessary capital more
    difficult or costly;

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

GENERAL

Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public
    utility holding company under PUHCA 2005 administered by FERC.
    Ameren was formed in 1997 by the merger of UE and CIPSCO. Ameren
    acquired CILCORP in 2003 and IP in 2004. Ameren’s primary
    assets are the common stock of its subsidiaries, including UE,
    CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP. Ameren’s subsidiaries, which
    are separate, independent legal entities, operate rate-regulated
    electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses,
    rate-regulated natural gas transmission and distribution
    businesses, and non-rate-regulated electric generation
    businesses in Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Ameren’s
    common stock depend upon distributions made to it by its
    subsidiaries.

To streamline its organizational structure, during late 2007,
    Ameren dissolved, merged or consolidated various of its
    subsidiaries that were inactive or had minimal or ancillary
    business operations. Among the subsidiaries eliminated was
    Ameren Energy, Inc., which previously served as a power
    marketing and risk management agent for UE. UE now performs such
    functions for itself. To further streamline its organizational
    structure, in February 2008, Development Company was eliminated
    through merger and Ameren Energy Resources Company was merged
    into the newly created Resources Company. As a part of this
    internal reorganization, on February 29, 2008, UE’s
    40% ownership interest and Development Company’s 40%
    ownership interest in EEI were transferred to this newly created
    Resources Company.

The following table presents our total employees at
    December 31, 2007:

(a)

Total for Ameren includes Ameren
    registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries.

The IBEW, the IUOE, the NCF&O and the Laborers and Gas
    Fitters labor unions collectively represent about 61% of
    Ameren’s total employees. They represent 72% of the
    employees at UE, 81% at CIPS, 72% at Genco, 70% at CILCORP, 70%
    at CILCO, and 90% at IP. All collective bargaining agreements
    that expired in 2007 have been renegotiated and ratified, with
    the exception of the benefits provisions contained in the
    agreements between IP and IBEW locals 51, 309, 702, and 1306.
    Bargaining over these benefits provisions continues at this
    time, with existing provisions remaining in effect. The majority
    of the renegotiated agreements have four- or five-year terms,
    and expire in 2011 and 2012. Four collective bargaining
    agreements between IP and the Laborers and Gas Fitters labor
    unions, covering approximately 127 employees, expire
    June 30, 2008.

For additional information about the development of our
    businesses, our business operations, and factors affecting our
    operations and financial position, see Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report and
    Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report.



BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

Ameren has three reportable segments: Missouri Regulated,
    Illinois Regulated, and Non-rate-regulated Generation. CILCORP
    and CILCO have two reportable segments: Illinois Regulated and
    Non-rate-regulated Generation. See Note 16 –
    Segment Information to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional
    information on reporting segments.

RATES AND
    REGULATION

Rates

Rates that UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are allowed to charge for
    their utility services are the single most important influence
    upon their and Ameren’s consolidated results of operations,
    financial position, and liquidity. The utility rates charged to
    UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP customers are determined by governmental
    entities. Decisions by these entities are influenced by many
    factors, including the cost of providing service, the quality of
    service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, economic
    conditions, public policy, and social and political views.
    Decisions made by these governmental entities regarding rates
    could have a material impact on the results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity of UE, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP
    and Ameren.

The ICC regulates rates and other matters for CIPS, CILCO and
    IP. The MoPSC regulates UE. FERC regulates UE, CIPS, Genco,
    CILCO, IP and EEI as to their ability to charge market-based
    rates for the sale and transmission of energy in interstate
    commerce and various other matters discussed below under General
    Regulatory Matters.

About 37% of Ameren’s electric and 13% of its gas operating
    revenues were subject to regulation by the MoPSC in the year
    ended December 31, 2007. About 41% of Ameren’s
    electric and 87% of its gas operating revenues were subject to
    regulation by the ICC in the year ended December 31, 2007.
    Wholesale revenues for UE, Genco and AERG are subject to FERC
    regulation, but not subject to direct MoPSC or ICC regulation.

Missouri
    Regulated

About 83% of UE’s electric and 100% of its gas operating
    revenues were subject to regulation by the MoPSC in the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

If certain criteria are met, UE’s gas rates may be adjusted
    without a traditional rate proceeding. PGA clauses permit
    prudently incurred natural gas costs to be passed directly to
    the consumer. The ISRS permits prudently incurred gas
    infrastructure replacement costs to be passed directly to the
    consumer.

A Missouri law enacted in July 2005 enables the MoPSC to put in
    place fuel and purchased power and environmental cost recovery
    mechanisms for Missouri’s electric utilities. The law also
    includes rate case filing requirements, a 2.5% annual rate
    increase cap for the environmental cost recovery mechanism, and
    prudency reviews, among other things. Rules for the fuel and
    purchased power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the
    MoPSC in September 2006 and became effective that year. Rules
    for the environmental cost recovery mechanism were approved by
    the MoPSC in February 2008 and will be effective once published
    in the Missouri Register. UE will not be able to utilize the
    cost recovery mechanisms until the MoPSC authorizes them as part
    of a rate case proceeding. UE was denied use of a fuel and
    purchased power cost recovery mechanism in its last electric
    rate order, in May 2007. UE plans to request use of a fuel and
    purchased power cost recovery mechanism and, potentially an
    environmental cost recovery mechanism, in its next electric rate
    case filing, expected in the second quarter of 2008.

With the expiration of multiyear electric and gas rate
    moratoriums, effective July 1, 2006, UE filed requests with
    the MoPSC in July 2006 for an electric rate increase and for a
    natural gas delivery rate increase. In March 2007, a stipulation
    and agreement approved by the MoPSC authorized an increase in
    annual natural gas delivery revenues of $6 million
    effective April 1, 2007. As part of this stipulation and
    agreement, UE agreed not to file a natural gas delivery rate
    case before March 15, 2010. This agreement did not prevent
    UE from filing to recover gas infrastructure replacement costs
    through an ISRS during this three-year rate moratorium. In
    February 2008, the MoPSC approved UE’s petition requesting
    the establishment of an ISRS to recover annual revenues of
    $4 million effective March 29, 2008.

In May 2007, the MoPSC issued an order, which, as clarified,
    granted UE an increase in base rates for electric service,
    effective June 4, 2007. For further information on Missouri
    rate matters, including the Missouri law enabling fuel and
    purchased power and environmental cost recovery mechanisms, see
    Results of Operations and Outlook in Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations under Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II,
    Item 7A, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory
    Matters, and Note 13 – Commitments and
    Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report.

Illinois
    Regulated

The following table presents the approximate percentage of
    electric and gas operating revenues subject to regulation by the
    ICC for each of the Illinois Regulated companies for the year
    ended December 31, 2007:

(a)

AERG’s revenues are not subject to ICC regulation.

If certain criteria are met, CIPS’, CILCO’s and
    IP’s gas rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate
    proceeding. PGA clauses permit prudently incurred natural gas
    costs to be passed directly to the consumer.



Environmental adjustment rate riders authorized by the ICC
    permit the recovery of prudently incurred MGP remediation and
    litigation costs from CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s
    Illinois electric and natural gas utility customers. As a part
    of the order approving Ameren’s acquisition of IP, the ICC
    also approved a tariff rider that allows IP to recover the costs
    of asbestos-related litigation claims, subject to the following
    terms. Beginning in 2007, 90% of cash expenditures in excess of
    the amount included in base electric rates is recoverable by IP
    from a trust fund established by IP and financed with
    contributions of $10 million each by Ameren and Dynegy. At
    December 31, 2007, the trust fund balance was
    $22 million, including accumulated interest. If cash
    expenditures are less than the amount in base rates, IP will
    contribute 90% of the difference to the fund. Once the trust
    fund is depleted, 90% of allowed cash expenditures in excess of
    base rates will be recoverable through charges assessed to
    customers under the tariff rider.

New electric rates for CIPS, CILCO and IP went into effect on
    January 2, 2007, reflecting delivery service tariffs
    approved by the ICC in November 2006 and full cost recovery of
    power purchased on behalf of Ameren Illinois Utilities’
    customers in the September 2006 power procurement auction in
    accordance with a January 2006 ICC order. See Results of
    Operations and Outlook in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under
    Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A,
    and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, and
    Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report for further information on rate matters. This material
    summarizes actions taken by certain Illinois legislators, the
    Illinois governor, the Illinois attorney general, and others
    regarding the expiration of the rate freeze at the beginning of
    2007, opposition to the 2006 power procurement auction, and the
    Illinois electric settlement agreement and establishment of the
    IPA, as well as electric and gas delivery service rate cases
    filed by CIPS, CILCO and IP in November 2007.

General
    Regulatory Matters

UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP must receive FERC approval to issue
    short-term debt securities and to conduct certain acquisitions,
    mergers and consolidations involving electric utility holding
    companies having a value in excess of $10 million. In
    addition, these Ameren utilities must receive authorization from
    the applicable state public utility regulatory agency to issue
    stock and long-term debt securities (with maturities of more
    than 12 months) and to conduct mergers, affiliate
    transactions, and various other activities. Genco, AERG and EEI
    are subject to FERC’s jurisdiction when they issue any
    securities.

Under PUHCA 2005, FERC and any state public utility regulatory
    agencies may access books and records of Ameren and its
    subsidiaries that are determined to be relevant to costs
    incurred by Ameren’s rate-regulated subsidiaries with
    respect to jurisdictional rates. PUHCA 2005 also permits Ameren,
    the ICC, or the MoPSC to request that FERC review cost
    allocations by Ameren Services to other Ameren companies.

Operation of UE’s Callaway nuclear plant is subject to
    regulation by the NRC. Its facility operating license expires on
    June 11, 2024. UE intends to submit a license extension
    application with the NRC to extend its Callaway nuclear
    plant’s operating license to 2044. UE’s Osage
    hydroelectric plant and UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage
    hydroelectric plant, as licensed projects under the Federal
    Power Act, are subject to FERC regulations affecting, among
    other things, the general operation and maintenance of the
    projects. On March 30, 2007, FERC granted a new

40-year

license for UE’s Osage hydroelectric plant and approved a
    settlement agreement among UE, the U.S. Department of the
    Interior, and various state agencies that was submitted in May
    2005 in support of the license renewal. The license for
    UE’s Taum Sauk plant expires on June 30, 2010. UE
    intends to file with FERC an application for license renewal of
    the Taum Sauk facility no later than June 30, 2008. The
    Taum Sauk plant is currently out of service and being rebuilt
    due to a major breach of the upper reservoir in December 2005.
    UE’s Keokuk plant and its dam, in the Mississippi River
    between Hamilton, Illinois, and Keokuk, Iowa, are operated under
    open-ended authority granted by an Act of Congress in 1905.

For additional information on regulatory matters, see
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and
    Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report, which include a discussion about the December 2005
    breach of the upper reservoir at UE’s Taum Sauk
    pumped-storage hydroelectric plant.

Environmental
    Matters

Certain of our operations are subject to federal, state, and
    local environmental statutes or regulations relating to the
    safety and health of personnel, the public, and the environment.
    These matters include identification, generation, storage,
    handling, transportation, disposal, record keeping, labeling,
    reporting, and emergency response in connection with hazardous
    and toxic materials, safety and health standards, and
    environmental protection requirements, including standards and
    limitations relating to the discharge of air and water
    pollutants. Failure to comply with those statutes or regulations
    could have material adverse effects on us. We could be subject
    to criminal or civil penalties by regulatory agencies. We could
    be ordered to make payment to private parties by the courts.
    Except as indicated in this report, we believe that we are in
    material compliance with existing statutes and regulations.

SUPPLY FOR
    ELECTRIC POWER

Ameren operates an integrated transmission system that comprises
    the transmission assets of UE, CILCO, CIPS, and IP. Ameren also
    operates two balancing authority areas, AMMO (which includes UE)
    and AMIL (which includes CILCO, CIPS, IP, AERG and Genco).
    During 2007, the peak demand in AMMO was 8,606 MW and in
    AMIL was 9,386 MW. Factors that could cause us to purchase
    power include, among other things, absence of sufficient owned
    generation, plant outages, the failure of suppliers to meet
    their power supply obligations, extreme weather conditions, and
    the availability of power at a cost lower than the cost of
    generating it. The Ameren transmission system directly connects
    with 17 other balancing authority areas for the exchange of
    electric energy.

UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are transmission-owning members of
    MISO, and they have transferred functional control of their
    systems to MISO. Transmission service on the UE, CIPS, CILCO and
    IP transmission systems is provided pursuant to the terms of the
    MISO OATT on file with FERC. See Note 2 – Rate
    and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report for further
    information. EEI operates its own balancing authority area and
    its own transmission facilities in southern Illinois. The EEI
    transmission system is directly connected to MISO and TVA.
    EEI’s generating units are dispatched separately from those
    of UE, Genco and AERG.

The Ameren Companies and EEI are members of SERC, a regional
    electric reliability organization with NERC-delegated authority
    for proposing and enforcing reliability standards. SERC is
    responsible for the bulk electric power supply system in much of
    the southeastern United States, including all or portions of
    Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, North
    Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama,
    Louisiana, Virginia, Florida, Oklahoma, Iowa, and Texas. The
    Ameren membership covers UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP.

Missouri
    Regulated

Factors that could cause UE to purchase power include, among
    other things, absence of sufficient owned generation, plant
    outages, the failure of suppliers to meet their power supply
    obligations, extreme weather conditions, and the availability of
    power at a cost lower than the cost of generating it.

UE’s electric supply is obtained primarily from its own
    generation. In March 2006, UE completed the purchase of three CT
    facilities, totaling 1,490 megawatts of capacity at a price of
    $292 million. These purchases were designed to help meet
    UE’s increased generating capacity needs and to provide UE
    with additional flexibility in determining when to add future
    baseload generating capacity. UE expects these CT facilities to
    satisfy demand growth until 2018 to 2020. However, due to the
    significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and
    build a baseload power plant, UE is actively studying future
    plant alternatives, including those that would use coal or
    nuclear fuel. See Outlook in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under
    Part II, Item 7 and Note 13 –
    Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report. UE filed in February
    2008 an integrated resource plan with the MoPSC. The plan
    includes proposals to pursue energy efficiency programs, expand
    the role of renewable energy sources in UE’s overall
    generation mix, increase operational efficiency at existing
    power plants, and possibly retire some generating units that are
    older and less efficient.

Illinois
    Regulated

As of January 1, 2007, CIPS, CILCO and IP were required to
    obtain all electric supply requirements for customers who did
    not purchase electric supply from third-party suppliers through
    the Illinois reverse power procurement auction held in September
    2006. CIPS, CILCO and IP entered into power supply contracts
    with the winning bidders, including their affiliate, Marketing
    Company. Under these contracts, the electric suppliers are
    responsible for providing to CIPS, CILCO and IP energy,
    capacity, certain transmission, volumetric risk management, and
    other services necessary for the Ameren Illinois Utilities to
    serve their customers at an all-inclusive fixed price with
    one-third of the supply contracts expiring in each of May 2008,
    2009 and 2010. New electric rates for CIPS, CILCO and IP went
    into effect on January 2, 2007. The new rates reflected
    delivery service tariffs approved by the ICC in November 2006
    and full cost recovery of power purchased on behalf of Ameren
    Illinois Utilities’ customers in the September 2006 reverse
    power procurement auction.

A portion of the electric power supply required for the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities to satisfy their distribution customers’
    requirements is purchased from Marketing Company on behalf of
    Genco, AERG and EEI. As part of the Illinois electric settlement
    agreement reached in 2007, the reverse power procurement auction
    in Illinois was discontinued and will be replaced with a new
    process led by the IPA, beginning in 2009. In 2008, utilities
    will contract for necessary power and energy requirements not
    already supplied through the September 2006 auction contracts,
    primarily through a request-for-proposal process, subject to ICC
    review and approval. Existing supply contracts from the
    September 2006 reverse power procurement auction remain in
    place. Also as part of the Illinois electric settlement
    agreement, the Ameren Illinois Utilities entered into financial
    contracts with Marketing Company (for the benefit of Genco and
    AERG), to lock in energy prices for 400 to 1,000 megawatts
    annually of their around-the-clock power requirements during the
    period June 1, 2008, to December 31, 2012, at relevant
    market prices. These financial contracts do not include
    capacity, are not load-following products, and do not involve
    the physical delivery of energy. See Note 2 –
    Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 12 – Related
    Party Transactions to our financial



statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a
    discussion of the ICC-approved power procurement auction.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Factors that could cause Marketing Company to purchase power for
    the Non-rate-regulated Generation business segment include,
    among other things, absence of sufficient owned generation,
    plant outages, the failure of suppliers to meet their power
    supply obligations, and extreme weather conditions.

In December 2006, Genco and Marketing Company, and AERG and
    Marketing Company, entered into new power supply agreements
    whereby Genco and AERG sell and Marketing Company purchases all
    the capacity available from Genco’s and AERG’s
    generation fleets and such amount of associated energy
    commencing on January 1, 2007. All of Genco’s and
    AERG’s generating capacity now competes for the sale of
    energy and capacity in the competitive energy markets through
    Marketing Company. See Note 12 – Related Party
    Transactions to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for additional information.

On December 31, 2005, EEI’s power supply contract with
    its affiliates, including UE, CIPS and IP, expired. EEI entered
    into a power supply agreement with Marketing Company whereby EEI
    sells 100% of its capacity and energy to Marketing Company at
    market-based prices. All of EEI’s generating capacity now
    competes for the sale of energy and capacity in the competitive
    energy markets through Marketing Company. See
    Note 12 – Related Party Transactions to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report for additional information.

Coal

UE, Genco, AERG and EEI have agreements in place to
    purchase a portion of their coal needs and to transport it to
    electric generating facilities through 2012. UE, Genco, AERG and
    EEI expect to enter into additional contracts to purchase coal.
    Coal supply agreements typically have an initial term of five
    years, with about 20% of the contracts expiring annually. Ameren
    burned 40.6 million (UE – 22.4 million,
    Genco – 10.1 million, AERG –
    3.1 million, EEI – 5.0 million) tons of coal
    in 2007. See Part II, Item 7A – Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this report for
    additional information about coal supply contracts.

About 94% of Ameren’s coal (UE – 97%,
    Genco – 88%, AERG – 92%, EEI –
    100%) is purchased from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. The
    remaining coal is typically purchased from the Illinois Basin.
    UE, Genco, AERG and EEI have a policy to maintain coal inventory
    consistent with their projected usage. Inventory may be adjusted
    because of uncertainties of supply due to potential work
    stoppages, delays in coal deliveries, equipment breakdowns, and
    other factors. As of December 31, 2007, coal inventories
    for UE, Genco, AERG and EEI were adequate and in excess of
    historical levels, but below targeted levels. Disruptions in
    coal deliveries could cause UE, Genco, AERG and EEI to pursue a
    strategy that could include reducing sales of power during
    low-margin periods, buying higher-cost fuels to generate
    required electricity, and purchasing power from other sources.

Nuclear

Fuel assemblies for the 2008 fall refueling at UE’s
    Callaway nuclear plant will begin manufacture during the second
    quarter of 2008. Enriched uranium for such assemblies is already
    at the facility. UE also has agreements or inventories to
    price-hedge 87% of Callaway’s 2010 and 2011 refueling
    requirements. There is no refueling scheduled in 2009 or 2012.
    UE expects to enter into additional contracts to purchase
    nuclear fuel. UE is a member of Fuelco, which allows UE to join
    with other member



companies to increase its purchasing power and opportunities for
    volume discounts. The Callaway nuclear plant normally requires
    refueling at

18-month

intervals. The last refueling was completed in May 2007.

Natural Gas
    Supply for Power Generation

Ameren’s portfolio of natural gas supply resources includes
    firm transportation capacity and firm no-notice storage capacity
    leased from interstate pipelines to maintain gas deliveries to
    our gas-fired generating units throughout the year, especially
    during the summer peak demand. UE, Genco and EEI primarily use
    the interstate pipeline systems of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
    Company, Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of
    America, and Mississippi River Transmission Corporation to
    transport natural gas to generating units. In addition to
    physical transactions, Ameren uses financial instruments,
    including some in the NYMEX futures market and some in the OTC
    financial markets, to hedge the price paid for natural gas.

UE, Genco and EEI’s natural gas procurement strategy
    is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural
    gas to their generating units. UE, Genco and EEI do this in two
    ways. They optimize transportation and storage options and
    minimize cost and price risk through various supply and price
    hedging agreements that allow them to maintain access to
    multiple gas pools, supply basins, and storage. As of
    December 31, 2007, UE had hedged about 25% of its required
    gas supply for generation in 2008 and Genco about 90%. As of
    December 31, 2007, EEI did not have any of its required gas
    supply for generation hedged for price risk.

NATURAL GAS
    SUPPLY FOR DISTRIBUTION

UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are responsible for the purchase and
    delivery of natural gas to their gas utility customers. UE,
    CIPS, CILCO and IP develop and manage a portfolio of gas supply
    resources, including firm gas supply under term agreements with
    producers, interstate and intrastate firm transportation
    capacity, firm storage capacity leased from interstate
    pipelines, and on-system storage facilities to maintain gas
    deliveries to our customers throughout the year and especially
    during peak demand. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP primarily use the
    Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, the Trunkline Gas Company,
    the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, the Mississippi
    River Transmission Corporation, and the Texas Eastern
    Transmission Corporation interstate pipeline systems to
    transport natural gas to their systems. In addition to physical
    transactions, financial instruments, including those entered
    into in the NYMEX futures market and in the OTC financial
    markets, are used to hedge the price paid for natural gas.
    Prudently incurred natural gas purchase costs are passed on to
    customers of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP in Illinois and Missouri
    under PGA clauses, subject to prudency review by the ICC and the
    MoPSC.

INDUSTRY
    ISSUES

We are facing issues common to the electric and gas utility
    industry and the non-rate-regulated electric generation
    industry. These issues include:

•

political and regulatory resistance to higher rates;

•

the potential for changes in laws, regulation, and policies at
    the state and federal level, including those resulting from
    election cycles;

•

the potential for more intense competition in generation and
    supply;

•

the potential for reregulation in some states, which could cause
    electric distribution companies to build generation facilities
    and to purchase less power from electric generating companies
    like Genco, AERG and EEI;

•

changes in the structure of the industry as a result of changes
    in federal and state laws, including the formation of
    non-rate-regulated generating entities and RTOs;

•

fluctuations in power prices due to the balance of supply and
    demand and fuel prices;

•

the availability of fuel and increases in prices;

•

the availability of labor and material and rising costs;

•

regulatory lag;

•

negative free cash flows due to rising investments and the
    regulatory framework;

•

continually developing and complex environmental laws,
    regulations and issues, including new air-quality standards,
    mercury regulations, and increasingly likely greenhouse gas
    limitations;

•

public concern about the siting of new facilities;

•

construction of power generation and transmission facilities;

•

proposals for programs to encourage or mandate energy efficiency
    and renewable sources of power;

•

public concerns about nuclear plant operation and
    decommissioning and the disposal of nuclear waste;

•

uncertainty in the credit markets; and

•

consolidation of electric and gas companies.

We are monitoring these issues. Except as otherwise noted in
    this report, we are unable to predict what impact, if any, these
    issues will have on our results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity. For additional information, see Risk
    Factors under Part I, Item 1A, and Outlook and
    Regulatory Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under

    Regulatory Matters, and Note 13 – Commitments and
    Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report.

ITEM 1A.
    RISK FACTORS

The electric and gas rates that UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are
    allowed to charge are determined through regulatory proceedings
    and are subject to legislative actions, which are largely
    outside of our control. Any such events that prevent UE, CIPS,
    CILCO or IP from recovering their respective costs or from
    earning appropriate returns on their investments could have a
    material adverse effect on future results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

The rates that certain Ameren Companies are allowed to charge
    for their services are the single most important item
    influencing the results of operations, financial position, and
    liquidity of the Ameren Companies. The electric and gas utility
    industry is highly regulated. The regulation of the rates that
    we charge our customers is determined, in large part, by
    governmental entities outside of our control, including the
    MoPSC, the ICC, and FERC. Decisions made by these entities could
    have a material adverse effect on results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

Our electric and gas utility rates are typically established in
    a regulatory proceeding that takes up to 11 months to
    complete. Rates established in those proceedings are primarily
    based on historical costs and include an allowed return on our
    investments by the regulator.

Our company, and the industry as a whole, is going through a
    period of rising costs, including increases in fuel, purchased
    power, labor and material costs, coupled with significant
    increases in capital, operation and maintenance and financing
    costs targeted at enhanced distribution system reliability and
    environmental compliance. Due to rising costs and the fact that
    our rates are primarily based on historical costs, UE, CIPS,
    CILCO and IP are not earning the allowed return established by
    their regulators (often referred to as regulatory lag). As a
    result, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP expect to be entering a period
    where more frequent rate cases and



requests for cost recovery mechanisms will be necessary. A
    period of increasing rates to our customers could result in
    additional regulatory, legislative, political, economic and
    competitive pressures that could have a material adverse effect
    on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Illinois

Pending Delivery
    Service Rate Cases

Due to inadequate recovery of costs and low returns on equity
    experienced in 2007 and expected in 2008, CIPS, CILCO and IP
    filed requests with the ICC in November 2007 to increase their
    annual revenues for electric delivery service by
    $180 million in the aggregate (CIPS –
    $31 million, CILCO – $10 million, and
    IP – $139 million). In addition, CIPS, CILCO and
    IP filed requests with the ICC in November 2007 to increase
    their annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by
    $67 million in the aggregate (CIPS –
    $15 million increase, CILCO – $4 million
    decrease and IP – $56 million increase). The ICC
    has until the end of September 2008 to render a decision in
    these rate cases. It could materially reduce the amount of the
    increase requested, or even reduce rates.

Illinois Electric
    Settlement Agreement

Due to the magnitude of rate increases that went into effect
    following the end of a rate freeze on January 2, 2007 under
    the Illinois Customer Choice Law, various legislators supported
    legislation that would have reduced and frozen the electric
    rates of CIPS, CILCO and IP at the level in effect prior to
    January 2, 2007, or would have imposed a tax on electric
    generation in Illinois to help fund customer assistance
    programs. The Illinois governor also supported rate rollback and
    freeze legislation. The rate rollback and freeze legislation
    would have prevented the Ameren Illinois Utilities from
    recovering from retail customers substantial portions of the
    cost of electric energy that the Ameren Illinois Utilities are
    obligated to purchase under wholesale contracts, and would also
    have caused the Ameren Illinois Utilities to under-recover their
    delivery service costs until the ICC could approve higher
    delivery service rates.

In order to address these concerns, the Illinois electric
    settlement agreement was reached in 2007. Ameren, on behalf of
    Marketing Company, Genco and AERG, the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities, Exelon, on behalf of Exelon Generation Company LLC,
    Commonwealth Edison Company, Exelon’s Illinois electric
    utility subsidiary, Dynegy Holdings, Inc., Midwest Generation,
    LLC, and MidAmerican Energy Company agreed to contribute an
    aggregate of $1 billion over four years to fund both rate
    relief programs and a new power procurement agency, the IPA.
    Approximately $488 million of the funding is earmarked as
    rate relief for customers of the Ameren Illinois Utilities. The
    Ameren Illinois Utilities, Genco and AERG agreed to make
    aggregate contributions of $150 million over a four-year
    period, which commenced in 2007, with $60 million coming
    from the Ameren Illinois Utilities (CIPS –
    $21 million; CILCO – $11 million;
    IP – $28 million), $62 million from Genco
    and $28 million from AERG. The Illinois electric settlement
    agreement provides that if legislation freezing or reducing
    retail electric rates or imposing or authorizing a new tax,
    special assessment or fee on generation of electricity is
    enacted before August 1, 2011, then the remaining funding
    commitments will expire. Any funds set aside in support of those
    commitments will be refunded to the utilities and electric
    generators. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory
    Matters to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for additional information on the
    Illinois electric settlement agreement.

The following factors resulting from implementation of the
    Illinois electric settlement agreement could have a material
    adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position
    or liquidity of Ameren, the Ameren Illinois Utilities, Genco or
    AERG:

•

uncertainty as to the implementation of the new power
    procurement process in Illinois for 2008 and 2009, including ICC
    review and approval requirements, the role of the IPA, timely
    procurement of power and recovery of costs from the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities’ customers, and the ability of the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities or other electric distribution
    companies to lease or invest in generation facilities;

•

the extent to which the IPA may exercise its statutory authority
    to build or invest in generation facilities;

•

the increase in short-term or long-term borrowings by the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities, Genco and AERG to fund contributions under
    the Illinois electric settlement agreement or to pay for or
    collateralize their obligations under future power purchase
    agreements;

•

the failure by the electric generators that are party to the
    settlement agreement to perform in a timely manner under their
    respective funding agreements, which permit the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities to seek reimbursement for a portion of the rate relief
    that will be provided to certain of their electric
    customers; and

•

the extent to which Genco and AERG will be successful in making
    future sales to meet a portion of Illinois’ total electric
    demand through the revised power procurement mechanism.

If, notwithstanding the Illinois electric settlement agreement,
    any decision is made or any action occurs that impairs the
    ability of CIPS, CILCO and IP to fully recover purchased power
    or distribution costs from their electric customers in a timely
    manner, and such decision or action is not promptly enjoined, it
    could result in material adverse consequences to Ameren, CIPS,
    CILCORP, CILCO and IP.

Missouri

With the expiration of multiyear electric and gas rate
    moratoriums, effective July 1, 2006, UE filed requests with
    the MoPSC in July 2006 for an electric rate increase of
    $361 million and for a natural gas delivery rate increase
    of $11 million. In March 2007, a stipulation and agreement
    approved by the MoPSC authorized an increase in annual natural
    gas delivery revenues of $6 million, effective
    April 1, 2007. As part of this stipulation and agreement,
    UE agreed not to file a natural gas delivery rate case before
    March 15,



2010. This agreement did not prevent UE from filing to recover
    infrastructure costs through an ISRS during this three-year rate
    moratorium. In February 2008, the MoPSC approved UE’s
    petition requesting the establishment of an ISRS to recover
    annual revenues of $1 million effective March 29, 2008.

In May 2007, the MoPSC issued an order authorizing a
    $43 million increase in UE’s base rates for electric
    service based on a return on equity of 10.2%. Certain aspects of
    the MoPSC decision have been appealed by UE, the Office of
    Public Counsel and the Missouri attorney general to the Court of
    Appeals for the Western District of Missouri. In its order, the
    MoPSC denied UE the use of a fuel and purchased power cost
    recovery mechanism. UE expects to incur significant increases in
    fuel and related transportation costs over the next three years.
    Without a rate recovery mechanism, UE may experience regulatory
    lag and not fully recover these costs.

Increased federal and state environmental regulation will
    cause UE, Genco, CILCO (through AERG) and EEI to incur large
    capital expenditures and increased operating costs. Future
    limits on greenhouse gas emissions would likely require UE,
    Genco, CILCO (through AERG) and EEI to incur significant
    additional increases in capital expenditures and operating
    costs. Such expenses, if excessive, could result in the closures
    of coal-fired generating plants.

About 61% of Ameren’s (UE – 54%,
    Genco – 60%, AERG – 95%, EEI –
    95%) generating capacity is coal-fired. About 84%
    (UE – 76%, Genco – 96%, AERG –
    99%, EEI – 100%) of its electric generation was
    produced by its coal-fired plants in 2007. The remaining
    electric generation comes from nuclear, gas-fired,
    hydroelectric, and oil-fired power plants. The EPA has issued
    final regulations with respect to
    SO


,
    NOx, and mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. These
    regulations require significant additional reductions in the
    emissions from UE, Genco, AERG and EEI power plants in phases,
    beginning in 2009, and significant capital expenditures.
    Missouri has adopted rules that substantially follow the federal
    regulations.

Illinois has adopted rules for mercury emissions that are
    significantly stricter than the federal regulations. In 2006,
    Genco, AERG, EEI, and the Illinois EPA entered into an agreement
    that was incorporated into Illinois’ mercury emission
    regulations. Under the regulations, Illinois generators may
    defer until 2015 the requirement to reduce mercury emissions by
    90% in exchange for accelerated installation of NOx and
    SO


controls. In 2009, Genco, AERG and EEI will begin putting into
    service equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions.

In February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
    Columbia issued a decision that effectively vacated the federal
    Clean Air Mercury Rule. The court ruled that the EPA erred in
    the method used to remove electric generating units from the
    list of sources subject to the maximum available control
    technology requirements under the Clean Air Act. The
    Court’s decision is subject to appeal, and it is uncertain
    how the EPA will respond. At this time, we are unable to
    determine the impact that this action would have on our
    estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental rules,
    our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Ameren’s estimated capital costs based on current
    technology to comply with both the federal Clean Air Interstate
    Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule and related state implementation
    plans range from $4 billion to $5 billion by 2017
    (UE – $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion;
    Genco – $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion,
    AERG – $620 million to $760 million,
    EEI – $310 million to $410 million).

Future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global
    warming are subject to active consideration in the
    U.S. Congress. Ameren believes that currently proposed
    legislation can be classified as moderate to extreme depending
    upon proposed
    CO


emission limits, the timing of implementation of those limits,
    and the method of allocating allowances. The moderate scenarios
    include provisions for a “safety valve” that provides
    a ceiling price for emission allowance purchases. As a result of
    our diverse fuel portfolio, our contribution to greenhouse gases
    varies among our generating facilities, but coal-fired power
    plants are significant sources of
    CO


,
    a principal greenhouse gas. Ameren’s current analysis shows
    that under some policy scenarios being considered in Congress,
    household costs and rates for electricity could rise
    significantly. The burden could fall particularly hard on
    electricity consumers and the Midwest economy because of the
    region’s reliance on electricity generated by coal-fired
    power plants. When consumed natural gas emits about half the
    amount of
    CO


as coal. As a result, economy-wide shifts favoring natural gas
    as a fuel source for electric generation also would affect the
    cost of nonelectric transportation, heating for our customers
    and many industrial processes. Under some policy scenarios being
    considered by Congress, Ameren believes that wholesale natural
    gas costs could rise significantly as well. Higher costs for
    energy could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and
    natural gas.

Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate
    limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in
    significant increases in capital expenditures and operating
    costs. Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or
    regulations might force Ameren and other similarly-situated
    electric power generators to close some coal-fired facilities.
    Mandatory limits could have a material adverse impact on
    Ameren’s, UE’s, Genco’s, AERG’s and
    EEI’s results of operations, financial position, or
    liquidity.

The EPA has been conducting an enforcement initiative to
    determine whether modifications at a number of coal-fired power
    plants owned by electric utilities in the United States are
    subject to New Source Review requirements or New Source
    Performance Standards under the Clean Air Act. The EPA’s
    inquiries focus on whether the best available emission control
    technology was or should have been used at such power plants
    when major maintenance or capital improvements were made.

In April 2005, Genco received a request from the EPA for
    information pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air



Act seeking detailed operating and maintenance history data with
    respect to its Meredosia, Hutsonville, Coffeen and Newton
    facilities, EEI’s Joppa facility, and AERG’s E.D.
    Edwards and Duck Creek facilities. In December 2006, the EPA
    issued a second Section 114(a) request to Genco regarding
    projects at the Newton facility. All of these facilities are
    coal-fired power plants. We are currently in discussions with
    the EPA and the state of Illinois regarding these matters, but
    we are unable to predict the outcome of these discussions.
    Resolution of the matters could have a material adverse impact
    on the future results of operations, financial position, or
    liquidity of Ameren, Genco, AERG and EEI. A resolution could
    result in increased capital expenditures, increased operations
    and maintenance expenses, and fines or penalties. We believe
    that any potential resolution would probably require the
    installation of emission control technology, some of which has
    already been planned for compliance with other regulatory
    requirements, such as the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the
    Illinois mercury emission rules.

New environmental regulations, voluntary compliance guidelines,
    enforcement initiatives, or legislation could result in a
    significant increase in capital expenditures and operating
    costs, decreased revenues, increased financing requirements,
    penalties and closure of power plants for UE, Genco, AERG and
    EEI. Although costs incurred by UE would be eligible for
    recovery in rates over time, subject to MoPSC approval in a rate
    proceeding, there is no similar mechanism for recovery of costs
    by Genco, AERG or EEI. We are unable to predict the ultimate
    impact of these matters on our results of operations, financial
    position or liquidity.

The construction of, and capital improvements to, UE’s,
    CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s electric and gas utility
    infrastructure as well as to Genco’s, CILCO’s (through
    AERG) and EEI’s non-rate-regulated power generation
    facilities involve substantial risks, particularly as the Ameren
    Companies expect to incur significant capital expenditures over
    the next five years and beyond for compliance with environmental
    regulations and to make significant investments in our utility
    infrastructure to improve overall system reliability. Should
    construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, it
    could have a material adverse impact on Ameren’s,
    UE’s, CIPS’, Genco’s, CILCORP’s,
    CILCO’s and IP’s results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity.

The Ameren Companies will incur significant capital expenditures
    over the next five years for compliance with environmental
    regulations and to make significant investments in their
    electric and gas utility infrastructure and their
    non-rate-regulated power generation facilities. The Ameren
    Companies estimate that they will incur up to $10.6 billion
    (UE – up to $4.9 billion; CIPS – up to
    $505 million; Genco – up to $2.1 billion;
    CILCO (Illinois Regulated) – up to $425 million;
    CILCO (AERG) – up to $870 million; IP –
    up to $1.1 billion; EEI – up to
    $555 million, Other – up to $205 million) of
    capital expenditures during the period from 2008 through 2012,
    including construction expenditures, capitalized interest and
    allowance for funds used during construction (except for Genco,
    which has no allowance for funds used during construction), and
    estimated expenditures for compliance with EPA and state
    regulations regarding
    SO


and NOx emissions and mercury emissions from coal-fired power
    plants. Costs for these types of projects continue to escalate.

Investment in Ameren’s regulated operations is expected to
    be recoverable from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts
    expended in non-rate-regulated operations will depend on whether
    market prices for power adjust as a result of market conditions
    reflecting increased costs generally for generators.

The ability of the Ameren Companies to successfully complete
    those facilities currently under construction, and those
    projects yet to begin construction within established estimates
    is contingent upon many variables and are subject to substantial
    risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project
    management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor
    and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits,
    shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and
    contractors not performing as required under their contracts,
    changes in the scope and timing of projects, and other events
    beyond our control may occur that may materially affect the
    schedule, cost and performance of these projects. With respect
    to capital expenditures related to the installation of pollution
    control equipment, there is a risk that such electric generating
    plants would not be permitted to continue to operate if
    pollution control equipment is not installed by prescribed
    deadlines or does not perform as expected. Should any such
    construction efforts be unsuccessful, the Ameren Companies could
    be subject to additional costs and the loss of their investment
    in the project or facility. The Ameren Companies may also be
    required to purchase additional electricity or gas to supply its
    customers until the projects are completed. All of these risks
    may have a material adverse effect on the Ameren Companies’
    results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Our counterparties may not meet their obligations to us.

We are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various
    arrangements who owe us money, energy, coal or other commodities
    or services will not be able to perform their obligations.
    Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform,
    we might be forced to replace or to sell the underlying
    commitment at then-current market prices. In such event, we
    might incur losses, or our results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected.

Certain of the Ameren Companies have obligations to other Ameren
    Companies or other Ameren subsidiaries because of transactions
    involving energy, coal, or other commodities and services and
    because of hedging transactions. If one Ameren entity failed to
    perform under any of these arrangements, other Ameren entities
    might incur losses. Their results of operations, financial
    position or liquidity could be adversely affected, resulting in
    such nondefaulting Ameren entity being unable to meet its
    obligations to unrelated third parties. Hedging activities are
    generally undertaken with a view



to the Ameren-wide exposures. Some Ameren Companies may
    therefore be more or less hedged than if they were to engage in
    such hedging alone.

Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit
    retirement plans, health care plans, and other employee-related
    benefits may adversely affect our results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

We offer defined benefit and postretirement plans that cover
    substantially all of our employees. Assumptions related to
    future costs, returns on investments, interest rates, and other
    actuarial matters have a significant impact on our earnings and
    funding requirements. In May 2007, the MoPSC issued an electric
    rate order that allows UE to recover through customer rates
    pension expense incurred under GAAP. Ameren expects to fund its
    pension plans at a level equal to the pension expense. Based on
    Ameren’s assumptions at December 31, 2007, and
    reflecting this pension funding policy, Ameren expects to make
    annual contributions of $40 million to $65 million in
    each of the next five years. We expect UE’s, CIPS’,
    Genco’s, CILCO’s, and IP’s portion of the future
    funding requirements to be 65%, 8%, 11%, 5%, and 11%,
    respectively. These amounts are estimates. They may change with
    actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates, any
    pertinent changes in government regulations, and any voluntary
    contributions.

In addition to the costs of our retirement plans, the costs of
    providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees
    have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that
    our employee benefit costs, including costs of health care plans
    for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.
    The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with
    our defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans, and
    other employee benefits may adversely affect our results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity.

UE’s, Genco’s, AERG’s, Medina Valley’s
    and EEI’s electric generating facilities are subject to
    operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant
    outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses,
    liability, and increased purchased power costs.

UE, Genco, AERG, Medina Valley, and EEI own and operate
    coal-fired, nuclear, gas-fired, hydroelectric, and oil-fired
    generating facilities. Operation of electric generating
    facilities involves certain risks that can adversely affect
    energy output, efficiency levels, operating costs, and
    investment levels. Among these risks are:

•

increased prices for fuel and fuel transportation;

•

facility shutdowns due to operator error or a failure of
    equipment or processes;

•

longer-than-anticipated maintenance outages;

•

disruptions in the delivery of fuel and lack of adequate
    inventories;

•

lack of water for cooling plant operations;

•

labor disputes;

•

inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements;

•

disruptions in the delivery of electricity;

•

increased capital expenditure requirements, including those due
    to environmental regulation;

•

unusual or adverse weather conditions, including
    drought; and

•

catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods, or other
    similar occurrences affecting electric generating facilities.

Even though agreements have been reached with state and
    federal authorities, the breach of the upper reservoir of
    UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility could
    continue to have an adverse effect on Ameren’s and
    UE’s results of operations, liquidity, and financial
    condition.

In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at
    UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility. This
    resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which
    damaged a state park.

In October 2006, FERC approved a stipulation and consent
    agreement between UE and FERC’s Office of Enforcement that
    resolves all issues arising from an investigation by FERC’s
    Office of Enforcement into alleged violations of license
    conditions and FERC regulations by UE, as the licensee of the
    Taum Sauk hydroelectric facility, that may have contributed to
    the breach of the upper reservoir. In November 2007, UE entered
    into a settlement agreement with the state of Missouri
    represented by the Missouri attorney general, the Missouri
    Conservation Commission and the Missouri Department of Natural
    Resources. The agreement resolved the state of Missouri’s
    lawsuit and claims for damages and other relief related to the
    December 2005 Taum Sauk breach. A business owners’ suit,
    which was filed in the Missouri Circuit Court of Reynolds County
    and remains pending, seeks damages relating to business losses
    and lost profit and unspecified punitive damages.

In February 2007, UE submitted to FERC an environmental report
    to rebuild the upper reservoir at Taum Sauk. UE received
    approval from FERC in August 2007 and hired a contractor in
    November 2007. The estimated cost to rebuild the upper reservoir
    is in the range of $450 million. The Taum Sauk plant is
    expected to be out of service at least through the fall of 2009.

As part of the settlement agreement with the state of Missouri,
    UE agreed not to attempt to recover from ratepayers in any
    future rate increase any in-kind or monetary payments to the
    state parties required by the settlement agreement or any costs
    incurred in the rebuilding of the upper reservoir (expressly
    excluding, however, enhancements, costs incurred due to
    circumstances or conditions that are currently not reasonably
    foreseeable, and costs that would have been incurred absent the
    December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at the Taum Sauk
    plant).

If UE needs to purchase power because of the unavailability of
    the Taum Sauk facility during the rebuild of the upper
    reservoir, UE has committed to not seek these additional costs
    from ratepayers. The Taum Sauk incident is expected to reduce
    Ameren’s and UE’s 2008 pretax earnings by
    $15 million to $20 million. UE expects to face
    higher-cost sources of



power, reduced interchange sales, and increased expenses, net of
    insurance reimbursement for replacement power costs.

UE believes that substantially all damages and liabilities
    caused by the breach, including costs related to the settlement
    agreement with the state of Missouri, the cost of rebuilding the
    plant, and the cost of replacement power, up to $8 million
    annually, will be covered by insurance. Insurance will not cover
    lost electric margins and penalties paid to FERC. Under
    UE’s insurance policies, all claims by or against UE are
    subject to review by its insurance carriers. Until litigation
    has been resolved and the insurance review is completed, among
    other things, we are unable to determine the total impact the
    breach may have on Ameren’s and UE’s results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity beyond those
    amounts already recognized.

The Missouri Parks Association and the Missouri Coalition for
    the Environment initiated legal proceedings over FERC’s
    decision to authorize the rebuilding of the upper reservoir at
    Taum Sauk. They seek injunctive and other relief. If they obtain
    injunctive relief, it could delay the construction of the
    rebuild and could delay the return of the plant to service.

Genco’s, AERG’s, and EEI’s electric generating
    facilities must compete for the sale of energy and capacity,
    which exposes them to price risks.

In December 2006, Genco and Marketing Company, and AERG and
    Marketing Company, entered into new power supply agreements
    whereby Genco and AERG sell and Marketing Company purchases all
    the capacity available from Genco’s and AERG’s
    generation fleets and such amount of associated energy
    commencing on January 1, 2007. All of Genco’s and
    AERG’s generating capacity now competes for the sale of
    energy and capacity in the competitive energy markets through
    Marketing Company.

On December 31, 2005, EEI’s power supply contract with
    its affiliates, including UE, CIPS and IP, expired. EEI entered
    into a power supply agreement with Marketing Company whereby EEI
    sells 100% of its capacity and energy to Marketing Company. All
    of EEI’s generating capacity now competes for the sale of
    energy and capacity in the competitive energy markets through
    Marketing Company.

To the extent that electricity generated by these facilities is
    not under a fixed-price contract to be sold, the revenues and
    results of operations of these non-rate-regulated subsidiaries
    generally depend on the prices that they can obtain for energy
    and capacity in Illinois and adjacent markets. Among the factors
    that could influence such prices (all of which are beyond our
    control to a significant degree) are:

•

current and future delivered market prices for natural gas, fuel
    oil, and coal and related transportation costs;

•

current and forward prices for the sale of electricity;

•

the extent of additional supplies of electric energy from
    current competitors or new market entrants;

•

the regulatory and pricing structures developed for evolving
    Midwest energy markets and the pace at which regional markets
    for energy and capacity develop outside of bilateral contracts;

•

changes enacted by the Illinois legislature, the ICC, the IPA or
    other government agencies with respect to power procurement
    procedures;

•

the potential for reregulation of generation in some states;

•

future pricing for, and availability of, services on
    transmission systems, and the effect of RTOs and export energy
    transmission constraints, which could limit our ability to sell
    energy in our markets;

•

the growth rate in electricity usage as a result of population
    changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of
    conservation programs;

•

climate conditions in the Midwest market; and

•

environmental laws and regulations.

UE’s ownership and operation of a nuclear generating
    facility creates business, financial, and waste disposal
    risks.

UE owns the Callaway nuclear plant, which represents about 12%
    of UE’s generation capacity and produced 19% of UE’s
    2007 generation. Therefore, UE is subject to the risks of
    nuclear generation, which include the following:

•

potential harmful effects on the environment and human health
    resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the
    storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;

•

the lack of a permanent waste storage site;

•

limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially
    available to cover losses that might arise in connection with UE
    or other U.S. nuclear operations;

•

uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment
    amounts if insurance coverage is inadequate;

•

increased public and governmental concerns over the adequacy of
    security at nuclear power plants;

•

uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial
    aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their
    licensed lives (UE’s facility operating license for the
    Callaway nuclear plant expires in 2024);

•

limited availability of fuel supply; and

•

costly and extended outages for scheduled or unscheduled
    maintenance.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose
    licensing and safety requirements for nuclear generation
    facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the
    authority to impose fines, shut down a unit, or both, depending
    upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until
    compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated
    by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at
    nuclear plants such as UE’s. In addition, if a serious
    nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material but
    indeterminable adverse effect on UE’s results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity. A major incident
    at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC
    to limit or prohibit the operation or relicensing of any
    domestic nuclear unit.



UE’s Callaway nuclear plant’s next scheduled refueling
    and maintenance outage is in the fall of 2008. During an outage,
    which occurs approximately every 18 months, maintenance and
    purchased power costs increase, and the amount of excess power
    available for sale decreases, compared with non-outage years.

Operating performance at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant has
    resulted in unscheduled or extended outages. The operating
    performance at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant declined both in
    comparison with its past operating performance and in comparison
    with the operating performance of other nuclear plants in the
    United States. Ameren and UE are actively working to address the
    factors that led to the decline in Callaway’s operating
    performance. Management and supervision of operating personnel,
    equipment reliability, maintenance worker practices, engineering
    performance, training, and overall organizational effectiveness
    have been reviewed. Some actions have been taken. However,
    Ameren and UE cannot predict whether such efforts will result in
    an overall improvement of operations at Callaway. Any additional
    actions taken are expected to result in incremental operating
    costs at Callaway. Further, additional unscheduled or extended
    outages at Callaway could have a material adverse effect on the
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity of
    Ameren and UE.

Our energy risk management strategies may not be effective in
    managing fuel and electricity procurement and pricing risks,
    which could result in unanticipated liabilities or increased
    volatility in our earnings and cash flows.

We are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas,
    fuel, electricity, emission allowances, and transmission
    congestion. Prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity, and
    emission allowances may fluctuate substantially over relatively
    short periods of time and expose us to commodity price risk. We
    use long-term purchase and sales contracts in addition to
    derivatives such as forward contracts, futures contracts,
    options, and swaps to manage these risks. We attempt to manage
    our risk associated with these activities through enforcement of
    established risk limits and risk management procedures. We
    cannot ensure that these strategies will be successful in
    managing our pricing risk or that they will not result in net
    liabilities because of future volatility in these markets.

Although we routinely enter into contracts to hedge our exposure
    to the risks of demand, weather, and changes in commodity
    prices, we do not hedge the entire exposure of our operations
    from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, our ability to
    hedge our exposure to commodity price volatility depends on
    liquid commodity markets. To the extent that commodity markets
    are illiquid, we may not be able to execute our risk management
    strategies, which could result in greater unhedged positions
    than we would prefer at a given time. To the extent that
    unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can
    adversely affect our results of operations, financial position,
    or liquidity.

Our facilities are considered critical energy infrastructure
    and may therefore be targets of acts of terrorism.

Like other electric and gas utilities, our power generation
    plants, fuel storage facilities, and transmission and
    distribution facilities may be targets of terrorist activities
    that could result in disruption of our ability to produce or
    distribute some portion of our energy products. Any such
    disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues or
    significant additional costs for repair, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity.

Our businesses are dependent on our ability to access the
    capital markets successfully. We may not have access to
    sufficient capital in the amounts and at the times needed.

We use short-term and long-term capital markets as a significant
    source of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not
    satisfied by our operating cash flow, including requirements
    related to future environmental compliance. As a result of
    rising costs and increased capital and operations and
    maintenance expenditures, coupled with near-term regulatory lag,
    we expect to need more short-term and long-term debt financing.
    The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly
    during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could
    negatively affect our ability to maintain and to expand our
    businesses. Our current credit ratings cause us to believe that
    we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However,
    events beyond our control, such as the recent collapse of the
    subprime mortgage market may create uncertainty that could
    increase our cost of capital or impair our ability to access the
    capital markets. Certain of the Ameren Companies rely in part on
    Ameren for access to capital. Circumstances that limit
    Ameren’s access to capital, including those relating to its
    other subsidiaries, could impair its ability to provide those
    Ameren Companies with needed capital. See the Credit Ratings
    section in Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report for a
    discussion of credit rating changes in response to actions in
    Illinois with respect to the matter of power procurement
    commencing in 2007.

Our other properties include office buildings, warehouses,
    garages, and repair shops.

With only a few exceptions, we have fee title to all principal
    plants and other units of property material to the operation of
    our businesses, and to the real property on which such
    facilities are located (subject to mortgage liens securing our
    outstanding first mortgage bond and credit facility indebtedness
    and to certain permitted liens and judgment liens). The
    exceptions are as follows:

•

A portion of UE’s Osage plant reservoir, certain facilities
    at UE’s Sioux plant, most of UE’s Peno Creek and
    Audrain CT facilities, Genco’s Columbia CT facility,
    AERG’s Indian Trails generating facility, Medina
    Valley’s generating facility, certain of Ameren’s
    substations, and most of our transmission and distribution lines
    and gas mains are situated on lands we occupy under leases,
    easements, franchises, licenses or permits.

•

The United States or the state of Missouri may own or may have
    paramount rights to certain lands lying in the bed of the Osage
    River or located between the inner and outer harbor lines of the
    Mississippi River on which



certain of UE’s generating and other properties are located.

•

The United States, the state of Illinois, the state of Iowa, or
    the city of Keokuk, Iowa, may own or may have paramount rights
    with respect to certain lands lying in the bed of the
    Mississippi River on which a portion of UE’s Keokuk plant
    is located.

Substantially all of the properties and plant of UE, CIPS, CILCO
    and IP are subject to the direct first liens of the indentures
    securing their mortgage bonds. In July 2006 and February 2007,
    AERG recorded open-ended mortgages and security agreements with
    respect to its E.D. Edwards and Duck Creek power plants. These
    plants serve as collateral to secure its obligations under
    multiyear, senior secured credit facilities entered into on
    July 14, 2006 and February 9, 2007, along with other
    Ameren subsidiaries. See Note 4 – Credit
    Facilities and Liquidity for details of the credit facilities.

UE has conveyed most of its Peno Creek CT facility to the city
    of Bowling Green, Missouri, and leased the facility back from
    the city through 2022. Under the terms of this capital lease, UE
    is responsible for all operation and maintenance
    responsibilities for the facility. Ownership of the facility
    will transfer to UE at the expiration of the lease, at which
    time the property and plant will become subject to the lien of
    any outstanding UE first mortgage bond indenture.

In March 2006, UE purchased a CT facility located in Audrain
    County, Missouri, from NRG Audrain Holding, LLC, and NRG Audrain
    Generating LLC, affiliates of NRG Energy, Inc. (collectively,
    NRG). As a part of this transaction, UE was assigned the rights
    of NRG as lessee of the CT facility under a long-term lease with
    Audrain County and assumed NRG’s obligations under the
    lease. The lease term will expire December 1, 2023. Under
    the terms of this capital lease, UE has all operation and
    maintenance responsibilities for the facility, and ownership of
    the facility will be transferred to UE at the expiration of the
    lease. When ownership of the Audrain County CT facility is
    transferred to UE by the county, the property and plant will
    become subject to the lien of any outstanding UE first mortgage
    bond indenture.

See Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to
    our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for information on mechanics’ liens filed
    against CILCO’s Duck Creek plant.

ITEM 3.
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

We are involved in legal and administrative proceedings before
    various courts and agencies with respect to matters that arise
    in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve
    substantial amounts of money. We believe that the final
    disposition of these proceedings, except as otherwise disclosed
    in this report, will not have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Risk of
    loss is mitigated, in some cases, by insurance or contractual or
    statutory indemnification. We believe that we have established
    appropriate reserves for potential losses.

In December 2007, Caterpillar Inc., in conjunction with other
    industrial customers as a coalition, intervened in the 2007 rate
    cases filed by CILCO and IP with the ICC to modify their
    electric and natural gas delivery service rates. Douglas R.
    Oberhelman is an executive officer of Caterpillar Inc. and a
    member of the board of directors of Ameren. Mr. Oberhelman
    did not participate in Ameren Corporation’s board and
    committee deliberations relating to these matters.

For additional information on legal and administrative
    proceedings, see Rates and Regulation under Item 1,
    Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, above. See also
    Liquidity and Capital Resources and Regulatory Matters in
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, and
    Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report.

ITEM 4.

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders

ITEM 7.
    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

Ameren Executive
    Summary

Operations

In 2007, we accomplished some key objectives that we believe
    will bring significant long-term benefits to our customers and
    shareholders. In Illinois, the Ameren Illinois Utilities, Genco
    and AERG reached a comprehensive settlement that will help
    Ameren Illinois Utilities customers’ transition to higher
    electric rates and bring stability to the power procurement
    process. Rate rollback and freeze legislation in response to
    higher electric rates in Illinois, driven by deregulation of
    that market, would have had severe negative operational and
    financial consequences for Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP,
    as well as significantly impacted the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service to their
    customers. Major stakeholders involved with this issue,
    including the Illinois governor’s office, leaders of the
    House of Representatives and Senate in Illinois, and the
    Illinois attorney general’s office, agreed to the Illinois
    electric settlement agreement. As a result, the Illinois
    electric settlement agreement provides significantly greater
    levels of legislative, regulatory and legal certainty. It also
    enables a viable competitive power supply market to continue to
    develop in Illinois.

In late 2007, the Ameren Illinois Utilities requested to
    increase annual revenues for electric and gas delivery services
    by $247 million in the aggregate. The Ameren Illinois
    Utilities also requested ICC approval to implement rate
    adjustment mechanisms for bad debt expenses, certain electric
    infrastructure investments and the decoupling of natural gas
    revenues from sales volumes. The ICC has until the end of
    September 2008 to render a decision in these rate cases. UE also
    expects to file an electric rate increase request in Missouri in
    the second quarter of 2008 to mitigate higher cost and
    investment levels. Constructive outcomes for the rate cases in
    Illinois and Missouri are very important to UE and the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP need to recover their
    costs to continue investing in their energy infrastructure on a
    timely basis and provide their customers with safe and reliable
    service.

In Missouri, we were able to settle all state and federal issues
    associated with the December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir
    at UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility. UE
    has begun rebuilding the upper reservoir and expects the plant
    to be out of service until the fall of 2009, if not longer. The
    cost of the rebuild is expected to be in the range of
    $450 million. UE believes that substantially all damages
    and liabilities (but not fines and penalties) caused by the
    breach, including costs related to the settlement agreement with
    the state of Missouri, the cost of rebuilding the plant, and the
    cost or replacement power, up to $8 million annually, will
    be covered by insurance.

In February 2008, UE filed an integrated resource plan with the
    MoPSC. The integrated resource plan outlines support for energy
    efficiency measures to reduce demand growth, expand renewable
    generation and increase existing power plant efficiency. Some of
    UE’s coal-fired power plants are aging, and an analysis
    will be completed in 2009 to determine which units are likely
    candidates for retirement. The integrated resource plan
    concludes that a new baseload plant is expected to be required
    in our regulated Missouri operations in the 2018 to 2020
    timeframe. For that reason, UE is preserving the option to
    develop additional nuclear generation, while researching clean
    coal and carbon sequestration technologies. UE expects to file
    in 2008 a



construction and operating license application with the NRC for
    a new unit at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant site. While this
    filing will not represent a final decision, it preserves the
    option to build a nuclear unit. UE will not proceed on any new
    baseload power plant unless construction costs are recoverable
    through rates in Missouri. In addition to considering a new unit
    at Callaway, UE also began the process in 2008 to extend through
    2044 the existing unit license at Callaway, which currently
    expires in 2024.

In 2007, Ameren’s Non-rate-regulated Generation business
    segment continued to execute its plan for investing in its power
    plants to improve their future productivity, as well as to
    effectively market their generation, consistent with their risk
    management framework. Non-rate-regulated Generation has also
    begun significant work on some of its coal-fired plants to begin
    installing additional environmental controls.

Earnings

Ameren reported net income of $618 million, or
    $2.98 per share, for 2007 compared to net income of
    $547 million, or $2.66 per share, in 2006. Earnings in
    2007 principally benefited from, among other things,
    higher-priced power sales contracts in Ameren’s
    Non-rate-regulated Generation business segment, the June 2007
    implementation of a Missouri electric rate order and greater
    demand for electricity and natural gas caused by warmer summer
    and cooler winter weather than in 2006.

Ameren’s 2007 earnings were reduced by 21 cents per share
    for the net cost of the Illinois electric settlement agreement.
    Storm-related costs in 2006 reduced net income by 26 cents per
    share. The impact of storm restoration efforts was less in 2007,
    but still significant. Ameren’s 2007 earnings were reduced
    by

9 cents

per share as a result of the cost of restoration efforts
    associated with a severe ice storm in January 2007. In addition,
    a FERC order retroactively adjusting prior years’ RTO costs
    reduced 2007 earnings by

6 cents

per share. Other items that unfavorably impacted earnings were,
    among other things, higher fuel costs and bad debt expenses,
    lower emission allowance sales, increased expenditures to
    improve reliability in Ameren’s regulated business segments
    and higher depreciation and financing costs due to greater
    energy infrastructure investment. In addition, there were fewer
    sales of noncore properties in 2007.

Liquidity

Cash flows from operations of $1.1 billion in 2007 at
    Ameren, along with other funds, were used to pay dividends to
    common shareholders of $527 million and to fund capital
    expenditures of $1.4 billion. Financing activities in 2007
    primarily consisted of refinancing debt and funding capital
    investment with borrowings under credit facilities.

Outlook

Over the next few years, we expect to make significant
    investments in our electric and gas infrastructure to improve
    the reliability of our distribution systems and to comply with
    environmental regulations. These investments are consistent with
    our customers’ and regulators’ expectations. We expect
    that earnings growth in our rate-regulated businesses will come
    from updating existing customer rates to better reflect these
    investments and the current levels of costs UE and the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities are experiencing. However, in the near-term,
    the returns experienced in 2007 and expected to be experienced
    in 2008 by UE and the Ameren Illinois Utilities are below levels
    allowed by the respective state utility commissions in their
    last rate cases. That is due to the fact that UE’s and the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities’ current rates are significantly
    below the cost and investment levels they are incurring in their
    businesses today. In a rising cost environment, earnings will be
    negatively impacted due to regulatory lag until appropriate
    levels of rate relief are granted. Our plan to address this
    shortfall and to achieve earnings growth is very
    straightforward: UE and the Ameren Illinois Utilities will file
    more frequent rate cases requesting moderate rate increases, as
    well as seek appropriate cost recovery mechanisms to mitigate
    regulatory lag.

In addition, we will continue to optimize Ameren’s
    Non-rate-regulated Generation’s assets, focusing on
    improving the output of these plants and related energy
    marketing. While we currently believe that rising costs,
    including fuel, depreciation and financing costs will largely
    offset these productivity gains, we believe our plants will be
    well positioned for earnings growth in the future should energy
    and capacity prices improve.

The EPA has issued more stringent emission limits on all
    coal-fired power plants. Between 2008 and 2017 Ameren expects
    that certain Ameren Companies will be required to invest between
    $4 billion and $5 billion to retrofit their power
    plants with pollution control equipment. Costs for these types
    of projects continue to escalate. These investments will also
    result in decreased plant availability during construction and
    significantly higher ongoing operating expenses. Approximately
    45% of this investment will be in Ameren’s regulated UE
    operations, and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from
    ratepayers.

Future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global
    warming are subject to active consideration in the
    U.S. Congress. Ameren believes that currently proposed
    legislation can be classified as moderate to extreme depending
    upon proposed
    CO


emission limits, the timing of implementation of those limits,
    and the method of allocating allowances. We support public
    policy that will result in substantial reductions in
    CO


emission. However,
    CO


policy must take into account the profound economic implications
    of moving toward a carbon constrained economy. We believe any
    legislation should include the following principles in order to
    limit the negative impact on our customers, economy and company:

•

Recognition of the significant economic impact of greenhouse gas
    policies on consumers and businesses in regions now dependent on
    coal.

•

Compliance timelines consistent with development of advanced
    technologies.



•

Provisions for significant research funding.

•

Provisions for an effective cap and trade program.

•

Allowances for greenhouse gas offsets, such as reforestation.

•

Removal of potential regulatory and financial barriers to
    improvement in existing infrastructure.

•

Broad-based
    CO


regulation across all industries.

•

A national and global policy approach.

Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate
    limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in
    significant increases in capital expenditures and operating
    costs. The costs to comply with future legislation or
    regulations could be so expensive that Ameren and other
    similarly situated electric power generators may be forced to
    close some coal-fired facilities. Mandatory limits could have a
    material adverse impact on Ameren’s, UE’s,
    Genco’s, AERG’s and EEI’s results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

The Ameren Companies will incur significant capital expenditures
    over the next five years as they comply with environmental
    regulations and make significant investments in their electric
    and gas utility infrastructure to improve overall system
    reliability. Expenditures not funded with operating cash flows
    are expected to be funded primarily with debt.

General

Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public
    utility holding company. Ameren’s primary assets are the
    common stock of its subsidiaries. Ameren’s subsidiaries are
    separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses,
    assets and liabilities. These subsidiaries operate
    rate-regulated electric generation, transmission and
    distribution businesses, rate-regulated natural gas transmission
    and distribution businesses, and non-rate-regulated electric
    generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois, as discussed
    below. Dividends on Ameren’s common stock are dependent on
    distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. See
    Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for a detailed description of our
    principal subsidiaries.

•

UE operates a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission
    and distribution business, and a rate-regulated natural gas
    transmission and distribution business in Missouri. Before
    May 2, 2005, UE also operated those businesses in Illinois.

•

CIPS operates a rate-regulated electric and natural gas
    transmission and distribution business in Illinois.

•

Genco operates a non-rate-regulated electric generation business.

•

CILCO, a subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company), operates a
    rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and
    distribution business and a non-rate-regulated electric
    generation business (through its subsidiary, AERG) in Illinois.

•

IP operates a rate-regulated electric and natural gas
    transmission and distribution business in Illinois.

The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a
    consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its
    majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
    transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts
    are expressed in millions, unless otherwise indicated.

In addition to presenting results of operations and earnings
    amounts in total, we present certain information in cents per
    share. These amounts reflect factors that directly affect
    Ameren’s earnings. We believe this per share information
    helps readers to understand the impact of these factors on
    Ameren’s earnings per share. All references in this report
    to earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares
    outstanding during the applicable year.

RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Earnings
    Summary

Our results of operations and financial position are affected by
    many factors. Weather, economic conditions, and the actions of
    key customers or competitors can significantly affect the demand
    for our services. Our results are also affected by seasonal
    fluctuations: winter heating and summer cooling demands. The
    vast majority of Ameren’s revenues are subject to state or
    federal regulation. This regulation has a material impact on the
    price we charge for our services. Non-rate-regulated Generation
    sales are also subject to market conditions for power. We
    principally use coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil in our
    operations. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate
    significantly due to the global economic and political
    environment, weather, supply and demand, and many other factors.
    We do not currently have a fuel and purchased power cost
    recovery mechanism in Missouri for our electric utility
    business. We do have natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for
    our Illinois and Missouri gas delivery businesses and purchased
    power cost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois electric
    delivery businesses. See Note 2 – Rate and
    Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, for a discussion of pending and
    recently decided rate cases and the Illinois electric settlement
    agreement. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our cost of
    borrowing and our pension and postretirement benefits costs. We
    employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure
    to commodity risk and other risks inherent in our business. The
    reliability of our power plants and transmission and
    distribution systems, the level of purchased power costs,
    operating and administrative costs, and capital investment are
    key factors that we seek to control to optimize our results of
    operations, financial position, and liquidity.

Ameren’s net income was $618 million ($2.98 per share)
    for 2007, $547 million ($2.66 per share) for 2006, and
    $606 million ($3.02 per share) for 2005. In 2005,
    Ameren’s net income included a net cumulative effect
    aftertax loss of $22 million (11 cents per share)
    associated with recording liabilities for conditional AROs as a
    result of our adoption of FIN 47, “Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.” The net

Ameren’s net income increased $71 million and earnings
    per share increased 32 cents in 2007 compared with 2006.

Compared with 2006 earnings, 2007 earnings were favorably
    affected by:

•

higher margins in the Non-rate-regulated Generation segment due
    to the replacement of below-market power sales contracts, which
    expired in 2006, with higher-priced contracts;

•

favorable weather conditions (estimated at 14 cents per share);

•

the absence of costs in 2007 that were incurred in 2006 related
    to the reservoir breach at UE’s Taum Sauk plant (15 cents
    per share);

•

higher electric rates, lower depreciation expense, decreased
    income tax expense and $5 million in
    SO


emission allowance sales in the Missouri Regulated segment
    pursuant to the MoPSC electric rate order for UE issued in May
    2007 (21 cents per share); and

•

decreased costs associated with outages caused by severe storms
    (17 cents per share).

Compared with 2006 earnings, 2007 earnings were negatively
    affected by:

•

electric rate relief and customer assistance programs provided
    to certain Ameren Illinois Utilities’ electric customers
    under the Illinois electric settlement agreement (21 cents per
    share) described in Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory
    Matters to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report;

•

the combined effect of the elimination of the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’ bundled tariffs, implementation of new delivery
    service tariffs effective January 2, 2007, and the
    expiration of below-market power supply contracts;

•

higher fuel and related transportation prices (31 cents per
    share);

•

higher labor and employee benefit costs (18 cents per
    share);

•

increased depreciation and amortization expense (13 cents
    per share);

•

higher financing costs (17 cents per share);

•

a planned refueling and maintenance outage at UE’s Callaway
    nuclear plant net of an unplanned outage at Callaway in 2006
    (9 cents per share);

•

increases in distribution system reliability expenditures (15
    cents per share);

•

higher bad debt expenses (8 cents per share);

•

lower emission allowance sales (16 cents per
    share); and

•

reduced gains on the sale of noncore properties, including
    leveraged leases (15 cents per share).

The cents per share information presented above is based on
    average shares outstanding in 2006.

Ameren’s net income before cumulative effect of the
    adoption of FIN 47 decreased $81 million and earnings
    per share decreased 47 cents in 2006 compared with 2005.

Compared with 2005 earnings, 2006 earnings were negatively
    affected by:

•

costs and lost electric margins associated with outages caused
    by severe storms (26 cents per share);

•

milder weather conditions (estimated at 17 cents per share);

•

costs associated with the reservoir breach at UE’s Taum
    Sauk plant (20 cents per share);

•

an unscheduled outage at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant
    (7 cents per share);

•

higher depreciation expense (11 cents per share);

•

increased taxes other than income taxes (8 cents per share);

•

contributions made in association with the Illinois Customer
    Elect electric rate increase phase-in plan (5 cents per
    share);

•

increased fuel and purchased power costs; and

•

higher financing costs.

An increase in the number of common shares outstanding also
    reduced Ameren’s earnings per share in 2006 compared with
    2005.

Compared with 2005, earnings in 2006 were favorably affected by:

•

higher margins on interchange sales (33 cents per share);

•

increased net gains on the sale of noncore properties, including
    leveraged leases, compared with 2005 (9 cents per share);

•

the lack of a refueling and maintenance outage at UE’s
    Callaway nuclear plant in 2006 (18 cents per share);

•

increased sales of emission allowances (5 cents per
    share); and

•

other factors including improved plant operations, lack of coal
    conservation efforts, industrial electric customers switching
    back to the Ameren Illinois Utilities, lower bad debt expenses,
    and organic growth.

The cents per share information presented above is based on
    average shares outstanding in 2005.



Because it is a holding company, Ameren’s net income and
    cash flows are primarily generated by its principal
    subsidiaries: UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP. The following
    table presents the contribution by Ameren’s principal
    subsidiaries to Ameren’s consolidated net income for the

Margins

The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable)
    variations in the registrants’ electric and gas margins
    from the previous year. Electric margins are defined as electric
    revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. Gas margins are
    defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale. The table
    covers the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005.
    We consider electric, interchange and gas margins useful
    measures to analyze the change in profitability of our electric
    and gas operations between periods. We have included the
    analysis below as a complement to the financial information we
    provide in accordance with GAAP. However, these margins may not
    be a presentation defined under GAAP, and they may not be
    comparable to other companies’ presentations or more useful
    than the GAAP information we provide elsewhere in this report.

2007 versus

Ameren

Ameren’s electric margin increased by $296 million, or
    9%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Factors contributing to an
    increase in Ameren’s electric margin were as follows:

•

More power sold by Non-rate-regulated Generation at market-based
    prices in 2007. These 2007 sales compared favorably with 2006
    sales at below-market prices, pursuant to cost-based power
    supply agreements that expired on December 31, 2006.

•

Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 19% increase in
    cooling

degree-days,

increased electric margin by $35 million.

•

UE’s electric rate increase, effective June 4, 2007,
    which increased electric margin by $29 million.

•

An increase in margin on interchange sales, primarily because of
    the termination of the JDA on December 31, 2006. This
    termination of the JDA provided UE with the ability to sell its
    excess power, originally obligated to Genco under the JDA at
    cost, in the spot market at higher prices. This increase was
    reduced by higher purchased power costs of $12 million
    associated with an agreement with Entergy Arkansas, Inc. See
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report, for more information on the UE power purchase agreement
    with Entergy Arkansas, Inc.

•

A 67% increase in hydroelectric generation because of improved
    water levels, which allowed additional generation to be used for
    interchange sales and reduced utilization of higher priced
    energy sources, increased Ameren’s electric margin by
    $27 million.

•

Increased Non-rate-regulated Generation capacity sales of
    $11 million.

•

Reduced severe storm-related outages in 2007 compared to those
    that occurred in 2006, which negatively impacted electric sales
    and resulted in a net reduction in overall electric margin of
    $9 million in 2006.

•

Insurance recoveries of $8 million related to power
    purchased to replace Taum Sauk generation. See
    Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report, for more information.

Factors contributing to a decrease in electric margin for 2007
    as compared with 2006 were as follows:

•

The combined effect on the Ameren Illinois Utilities’ of
    the elimination of bundled tariffs, implementation of new
    delivery service tariffs effective January 2, 2007, and the
    expiration of below-market power supply contracts.

•

A 14% increase in fuel prices.

•

Rate relief and customer assistance programs under the Illinois
    electric settlement agreement, which reduced electric margin by
    $73 million.

•

The loss of wholesale margins at Genco from power acquired
    through the JDA, which terminated in 2006.

•

Decreased emission allowance sales of $53 million, offset
    by lower emission allowance costs of $15 million.

•

Purchased power costs that were $18 million higher for the
    year because of a March 2007 FERC order that resettled costs
    among market participants retroactive to 2005.

•

Reduced plant availability. Ameren’s baseload nuclear and
    coal-fired generating plants’ average capacity and
    equivalent availability factors were approximately 78% and 86%,
    respectively, in 2007 compared with 80% and 88%, respectively,
    in 2006.

Ameren’s gas margin increased by $15 million, or 4%,
    in 2007. The primary causes of the increase were favorable
    weather conditions, as evidenced by an 8% increase in heating

degree-days,

which increased gas margin by an estimated $10 million, and
    the UE gas rate increase that went into effect in April 2007,
    which increased gas margin by $4 million.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

UE’s electric margin increased $76 million, or 4%, in
    2007 compared with 2006. The following items had a favorable
    impact on UE’s electric margin:

•

An increase in margin on interchange sales, primarily because of
    the termination of the JDA on December 31, 2006. The
    termination of the JDA allowed UE to sell its



excess power, originally obligated to Genco under the JDA at
    cost, in the spot market at higher prices. This increase was
    reduced by higher purchased power costs of $12 million
    associated with an agreement with Entergy Arkansas, Inc. See
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report, for more information.

•

The electric rate increase that went into effect June 4,
    2007, which increased electric margin by $29 million.

•

A 67% increase in hydroelectric generation because of improved
    water levels. This allowed additional generation to be used for
    interchange sales and reduced UE’s use of higher priced
    energy sources, which increased electric margin by
    $27 million.

•

Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 19% increase in
    cooling

degree-days,

which increased electric margin by $22 million.

•

Replacement power insurance recoveries of $20 million,
    including $8 million associated with Taum Sauk. See
    Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report, for more information.

•

Increased transmission service revenues of $18 million due
    to the ancillary service agreement with CIPS, CILCO, and IP. See
    Note 12 – Related Party Transactions to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report, for more information.

•

Decreased fuel costs due to the lack of $4 million in fees
    levied by FERC in 2006 upon completion of its cost study for
    generation benefits provided to UE’s Osage hydroelectric
    plant, and the May 2007 MoPSC rate order, which directed UE to
    transfer $4 million of the total fees to an asset account,
    which is being amortized over 25 years.

•

Reduced severe storm-related outages in 2007 compared with 2006,
    which negatively impacted electric sales that year and resulted
    in a net reduction in overall electric margin of $7 million
    in 2006.

Items that had an unfavorable impact on electric margin in 2007
    as compared with 2006 were as follows:

•

A 21% increase in fuel prices.

•

Decreased emission allowance sales of $29 million.

•

MISO purchased power costs that were $11 million higher due
    to the March 2007 FERC order.

•

Other MISO purchased power costs, excluding the effect of the
    March 2007 FERC order, that were $20 million higher.

•

Reduced power plant availability because of planned maintenance
    activities. UE’s baseload nuclear and coal-fired generating
    plants’ average capacity and equivalent availability
    factors were approximately 81% and 89%, respectively, in 2007
    compared with 84% and 90%, respectively, in 2006.

UE’s gas margin increased by $10 million, or 17%, in
    2007 compared with 2006. The following items had a favorable
    impact on gas margins:

•

The UE gas rate increase effective in April 2007, which
    increased gas margin by $4 million.

•

Unrecoverable purchased gas costs totaling $4 million in
    2006 that did not recur in 2007.

•

Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by an 8% increase in
    heating

degree-days,

which increased gas margin by $2 million.

Illinois
    Regulated

Illinois Regulated’s electric margin decreased by
    $64 million, or 8%, and gas margin increased by
    $10 million, or 3%, in 2007 compared with 2006. See below
    for explanations of electric and gas margin variances for the
    Illinois Regulated segment.

CIPS

CIPS’ electric margin decreased by $12 million, or 5%,
    in 2007 compared with 2006. The following items had an
    unfavorable impact on electric margin:

•

The combined effect of the elimination of bundled tariffs,
    implementation of new delivery service tariffs on
    January 2, 2007, and the expiration of below-market power
    supply contracts.

•

The Illinois electric settlement agreement, which reduced
    electric margin by $11 million.

•

MISO purchased power costs that increased $8 million
    because of the March 2007 FERC order.

The following items had a favorable impact on electric margin in
    2007 as compared with 2006:

•

Other MISO purchased power costs, excluding the effect of the
    March 2007 FERC order, that were $19 million lower, partly
    because of customers switching to third party suppliers and the
    termination of the JDA agreement at the end of 2006.

•

Reduced severe storm-related outages in 2007 compared to those
    that occurred in 2006, which negatively affected electric sales
    and resulted in a net reduction in overall electric margin of
    $3 million in 2006.

•

Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 20% increase in
    cooling

degree-days,

which increased native load electric margin by $6 million.

CIPS’ gas margin was comparable in 2007 and 2006.

    prices at EEI in 2007.

2006 versus

Ameren

Ameren’s electric margin increased by $41 million, or
    1%, in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to an
    increase in Ameren’s electric margin were as follows:

•

A $162 million, or 67%, increase in margin on interchange
    sales. The expiration of EEI’s affiliate cost-based power
    supply contract on December 31, 2005, the expiration of
    several large Marketing Company power supply contracts in 2006,
    and an increase in plant availability provided Ameren with
    additional power to sell in the spot market. The increase in
    margin on interchange sales from these items was reduced by
    lower power prices, resulting from declining market prices for
    natural gas, and the significant impact of hurricanes and coal
    delivery disruptions on prices in 2005.

•

Plant efficiencies, primarily at CILCO (AERG), as Ameren’s
    baseload electric generating plants’ average capacity and
    equivalent availability factors were approximately 80% and 88%,
    respectively, in 2006 compared with 76% and 86%, respectively,
    in 2005.

•

The lack of a UE Callaway nuclear plant refueling and
    maintenance outage in 2006, which resulted in an increased
    electric margin of $25 million.

•

Capacity upgrades performed during the refueling and maintenance
    outage in 2005, which increased Callaway’s output and
    electric margin by $22 million.

•

Organic growth and the movement of industrial customers back to
    below-market Illinois tariff rates because of the expiration of
    power contracts with suppliers.

•

Lower purchased power costs at IP.

•

Sales to Noranda, which began receiving power on June 1,
    2005, resulting in increased electric margin of $20 million
    at UE.

•

Increased sales of emission allowances, totaling
    $17 million, and lower emission allowance costs, totaling
    $11 million, in 2006 compared with 2005.

Factors contributing to a decrease in Ameren’s electric
    margin were as follows:

•

Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 9% decline in
    cooling

degree-days,

which reduced the native load electric margin by
    $33 million in 2006 compared with 2005.

•

Severe storm-related outages in 2006, which reduced overall
    electric margin by $9 million as less electricity was sold
    for native load. This was partially offset by an increase in
    margin on the sales of this power on the interchange market.

•

An increase in fuel and purchased power costs for native load at
    UE and Genco due to the expiration of a cost-based power supply
    contract with EEI.

•

A 12% increase in coal and transportation prices.

•

A $25 million reduction in margin because of the
    unavailability of UE’s Taum Sauk hydroelectric plant in
    2006 compared with 2005.

•

An $11 million reduction in native load margin from
    UE’s other hydroelectric generation in 2006 compared with
    2005.

•

An unscheduled outage in 2006 at UE’s Callaway nuclear
    plant, which reduced electric margin by an estimated
    $20 million.

•

Reduced transmission service revenues, primarily due to the
    elimination of interim cost recovery mechanisms and reduced
    revenues associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market.

Ameren’s gas margin decreased by $24 million, or 6%,
    in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily because of the following
    factors:

•

Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 9% decrease in
    heating

degree-days,

which reduced the gas margin by $15 million in 2006 from
    2005. Weather-sensitive residential and commercial gas sales
    volumes decreased by 8% each, in 2006 compared with 2005.

•

Unrecoverable purchased gas costs, together with unfavorable
    customer sales mix, totaling $19 million.

Factors contributing to an increase in Ameren’s gas margin
    were as follows:

•

An IP rate increase effective in May 2005, which added revenues
    of $6 million in 2006.

•

Increased sales to customers, excluding the impact from weather,
    of 2%, or $4 million.



Missouri
    Regulated

UE

UE’s total electric margin increased by $21 million in
    2006 compared with 2005. UE’s Missouri Regulated electric
    margin increased by $9 million in 2006 compared with 2005.
    The following items had a favorable impact on UE’s electric
    margin:

•

Sales to Noranda that increased electric margin by
    $20 million and other organic growth.

•

Increased sales of emission allowances, totaling
    $30 million.

•

The lack of a scheduled Callaway nuclear plant refueling and
    maintenance outage in 2006.

•

Capacity upgrades at the Callaway plant performed during the
    refueling and maintenance outage in 2005.

UE’s other electric margin increased by $12 million as
    a result of the adoption of Staff Accounting Bulletin 108.
    See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies, Accounting Changes and Other Matters, to our financial
    statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for
    further information.

Items that had an unfavorable impact on electric margin in 2006
    as compared to 2005 were as follows:

•

Unfavorable weather conditions, which reduced native load
    electric margin by $11 million, as evidenced by an 8%
    decline in cooling

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005.

•

Severe storm-related outages in 2006, which reduced electric
    native load sales and resulted in an estimated net reduction in
    electric margin of $7 million.

•

Lower margin on nonaffiliated interchange sales in 2006 compared
    with 2005, which resulted from reduced power prices. The average
    realized power prices on UE’s interchange sales decreased
    from $48 per megawatt hour in 2005 to $37 per megawatt hour in
    2006. However, the margin on interchange sales benefited from
    the January 10, 2006, amendment of the JDA. The
    MoPSC-required and FERC-approved change in the JDA methodology
    (to basing the allocation of third-party short-term power sales
    of excess generation on generation output instead of load
    requirements) resulted in $23 million in incremental margin
    on interchange sales for UE in 2006 compared with 2005.

•

The transfer of UE’s Illinois service territory in May 2005
    to CIPS, which decreased electric margin by an estimated
    $22 million in 2006 compared with 2005.

•

A 9% increase in coal and related transportation prices.

•

Fees of $4 million levied by FERC in 2006 for prior
    years’ generation benefits provided to UE’s Osage
    hydroelectric plant.

•

The unavailability of UE’s Taum Sauk hydroelectric plant.

•

UE’s other hydroelectric generation was lower due to
    drought-like conditions across the central and southern portions
    of Missouri.

•

An unscheduled

20-day

outage at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant in the second quarter
    of 2006, which reduced electric margin (maintenance expenses
    were covered under warranty).

•

MISO Day Two Energy Market costs, which were $6 million
    higher in 2006, as this market did not begin operating until the
    second quarter of 2005.

•

The expiration of a cost-based power supply contract with EEI on
    December 31, 2005.

•

Reduced transmission service revenues of $13 million,
    primarily due to elimination of interim cost recovery mechanisms
    and reduced revenues associated with the MISO Day Two Energy
    Market.

UE’s gas margin decreased by $13 million, or 18%, in
    2006 compared with 2005. The following items had an unfavorable
    impact on UE’s gas margin:

•

Mild winter weather conditions that reduced gas margin by
    $2 million, as evidenced by an 8% decrease in heating

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005.

•

The transfer of UE’s Illinois service territory in May 2005
    to CIPS, which reduced gas margin by $4 million.

•

A reduction in gas sales to customers, excluding the impacts
    from weather.

•

Unrecoverable purchased gas costs totaling $4 million.

Illinois
    Regulated

Illinois Regulated’s electric margin decreased by
    $5 million, or 1%, and its gas margin decreased by
    $8 million, or 3%, in 2006 compared with 2005. See below
    for explanations of electric and gas margin variances for the
    Illinois Regulated segment.

CIPS

CIPS’ electric margin increased by $3 million, or 1%,
    in 2006 compared with 2005. The following items had a favorable
    impact on electric margin:

•

The transfer to CIPS of UE’s Illinois service territory in
    May 2005, which increased electric margin by $7 million.

•

Customers, (primarily industrial), who switched back to CIPS
    from Marketing Company in 2006 because tariff rates were below
    market rates for power.

•

A decrease in MISO Day Two Energy Market costs of
    $7 million.

•

Increased miscellaneous revenues of $2 million.

The following items had an unfavorable impact on electric margin
    in 2006 as compared to 2005:

•

Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 9% decrease in
    cooling

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005, which reduced native load electric
    margin by $7 million.

•

Severe storm-related outages in 2006, which reduced electric
    sales and reduced the electric margin by $3 million.

•

Reduced transmission service revenues, primarily due to
    elimination of interim cost recovery mechanisms, and reduced
    revenues associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market.



Due to the expiration of CIPS’ cost-based power supply
    agreement with EEI in December 2005, pursuant to which CIPS sold
    its entitlements under the agreement to Marketing Company, both
    interchange revenues and purchased power expenses decreased by
    $34 million in 2006 compared with 2005.

CIPS’ gas margin increased by $1 million, or 1%, in
    2006, compared with 2005, primarily because the transfer to CIPS
    of UE’s Illinois service territory in May 2005 added
    $4 million to gas margin. CIPS’ increase in gas margin
    was reduced by mild winter weather, as evidenced by a 10%
    decrease in heating

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005, which reduced gas margin by
    $3 million.

CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated)

The following table provides a reconciliation of CILCO’s
    change in electric margin by segment to CILCO’s total
    change in electric margin for 2006 compared with 2005:

See Non-rate-regulated Generation under Results of Operations
    for a detailed explanation of CILCO’s (AERG) change in
    electric margin in 2006 compared with 2005.

CILCO’s Illinois Regulated electric margin increased by
    $7 million, or 5%, in 2006 compared with 2005. The
    following items had a favorable impact on electric margin:

•

Increased native load growth, primarily in the industrial sector.

•

Increased miscellaneous revenues totaling $2 million.

•

A decrease in MISO Day Two Energy Market costs totaling
    $2 million.

The following items had an unfavorable impact on electric margin
    in 2006 as compared to 2005:

•

Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by an 18% decrease
    in cooling

degree-days

in 2006, which reduced native load electric margin by
    $7 million.

•

Reduced transmission service revenues, primarily due to
    elimination of interim cost recovery mechanisms and reduced
    revenues associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market.

CILCO’s (Illinois Regulated) gas margin decreased by
    $10 million, or 10%, in 2006 compared with 2005. The
    following items had an unfavorable impact on gas margin:

•

Mild winter weather conditions in CILCO’s service
    territory, as evidenced by a 7% decrease in heating

degree-days

in 2006, which reduced gas margin by $3 million.

•

Lower transportation volumes, together with unfavorable customer
    sales mix.

IP

IP’s electric margin decreased by $15 million, or 4%,
    in 2006 compared with 2005. The following items had an
    unfavorable impact on electric margin:

•

Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 10% decrease
    in cooling

degree-days

in 2006, which reduced native load electric margin by
    $9 million.

•

Severe storm-related outages in 2006, which resulted in reduced
    electric sales, decreasing electric margin by $2 million.

•

Reduced transmission service revenues of $17 million,
    primarily due to the elimination of interim cost recovery
    mechanisms and reduced revenues associated with the MISO Day Two
    Energy Market.

The following items had a favorable impact on electric margin in
    2006 compared with 2005:

•

A net increase in electric margin as a result of customers,
    (primarily industrial), who switched back to IP because tariff
    rates were below market rates for power. The increase in
    revenues more than offset an increase in purchased power costs.

•

Lower transmission expenses included in purchased power costs
    due, in part, to a $6 million favorable settlement of
    disputed ancillary charges with MISO.

•

Lower MISO Day Two Energy Market costs totaling $4 million.

•

Increased rental and miscellaneous revenues totaling
    $5 million.

IP’s gas margin increased by $1 million, or 1%, in
    2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to an increase in
    IP’s gas margin were as follows:

•

A rate increase effective in May 2005 that added revenues of
    $6 million in 2006.

•

Organic growth, primarily in the industrial sector.

The increase in gas margin was reduced by mild winter weather
    conditions, as evidenced by a 9% decrease in heating

degree-days

in 2006 compared with 2005, which reduced gas margin by
    $7 million.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Non-rate-regulated Generation’s electric margin increased
    by $53 million, or 8%, in 2006 compared with 2005. See
    below for explanations of electric margin variances for the
    Non-rate-regulated Generation segment.

Genco

Genco’s electric margin decreased by $103 million, or
    22%, in 2006 compared with 2005. The following items had an
    unfavorable impact on electric margin:

•

A lower wholesale sales margin, as Genco purchased additional
    power at higher costs to supply Marketing Company after the
    expiration of the cost-based power supply contract between EEI
    and its affiliates on December 31, 2005.



•

Lower emission allowance sales, because of a $21 million
    gain at Genco in the third quarter of 2005, which resulted from
    the nonmonetary swap of certain earlier vintage-year
    SO


emission allowances for later vintage-year allowances.

•

A 9% increase in coal and transportation prices.

•

A lower margin on interchange sales in 2006 compared with 2005,
    primarily because of lower power prices, and a $23 million
    reduction in 2006 due to the January 2006 amendment of the JDA
    among UE, Genco and CIPS discussed above. The average realized
    power prices on Genco’s interchange sales decreased from
    $47 per megawatthour in 2005 to $38 per megawatthour in
    2006.

•

Higher MISO Day Two Energy Market costs, totaling
    $12 million in 2006 compared with 2005. The market did not
    begin operating until the second quarter of 2005.

Genco’s decrease in electric margin was reduced by
    increased sales to CIPS as a result of the May 2005 transfer of
    UE’s Illinois service territory to CIPS.

CILCO (AERG)

AERG’s electric margin increased by $22 million, or
    25%, in 2006 compared with 2005. The following items had a
    favorable impact on electric margin:

•

Lower purchased power costs due to improved power plant
    availability.

•

A decrease in emission allowance utilization expenses of
    $8 million in 2006.

•

An increase in margin on interchange sales due to improved plant
    availability. AERG’s electric generating plants’
    average capacity and equivalent availability factors were
    approximately 69% and 81%, respectively, in 2006 compared with
    61% and 73%, respectively, in 2005.

AERG’s electric margin was reduced by a 31% increase in
    coal and transportation prices in 2006 over 2005.

EEI

EEI’s electric margin increased by $194 million in
    2006 compared with 2005. The following items had a favorable
    impact on electric margin:

•

An increase in margin on interchange sales, which resulted from
    the expiration of an affiliate cost-based power supply agreement
    on December 31, 2005, and its replacement with an affiliate
    market-based power supply agreement.

•

Sales of emission allowances.

Other Operations
    and Maintenance Expenses

2007 versus

Ameren

Ameren’s other operations and maintenance expenses
    increased $132 million in 2007 compared with 2006.
    Maintenance and labor costs associated with the Callaway nuclear
    plant refueling and maintenance outage in the second quarter of
    2007 added $35 million. Distribution system reliability
    expenditures increased $49 million and employee benefits
    and non-Callaway labor costs were higher by $55 million in
    2007 compared with 2006. Bad debt expenses increased
    $25 million in 2007, primarily as a result of the
    transition to higher electric rates in Illinois. Increases in
    maintenance at coal-fired power plants and injuries and damages
    reserves also contributed to higher other operations and
    maintenance expenses in 2007. We recognized reduced gains on
    sales of noncore property in 2007 of $4 million as compared
    to gains of $16 million in 2006. Additionally, other
    operations and maintenance expenses in 2007 included a payment
    of $4.5 million made to the IPA as part of the Illinois
    electric settlement agreement.

Reducing the effect of these items was the reversal in 2007 of
    an accrual of $15 million established in 2006 for
    contributions to assist customers through the Illinois Customer
    Elect electric rate increase phase-in plan. In 2006, we also
    recognized costs of $25 million related to the December
    2005 Taum Sauk plant reservoir breach. Costs associated with
    storms in the spring and summer of 2006 and a major ice storm in
    the fourth quarter of 2006 exceeded the costs associated with an
    ice storm in January 2007 by $42 million, thereby reducing
    other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007 compared with
    2006.

Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses for the
    Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren
    Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased in 2007
    compared with 2006. Maintenance and labor costs associated with
    the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in
    2007 added $35 million to other operations and maintenance
    expenses compared with 2006. Higher distribution system
    reliability expenditures of $34 million, increased
    non-Callaway related labor costs of $22 million, and
    insurance premiums of $19 million for replacement power
    coverage paid to a risk insurance affiliate also increased other
    operations and maintenance expenses in 2007 compared with 2006.
    Reducing the effect of these items was the absence in 2007 of
    costs recorded in 2006 related to the Taum Sauk plant reservoir
    breach as discussed above. Costs associated with storms in the
    spring and summer of 2006 and a major ice storm in the fourth
    quarter of 2006 exceeded the costs associated with an ice storm
    in January 2007 by $13 million, thereby reducing other
    operations and maintenance expenses in 2007 compared with 2006.



Illinois
    Regulated

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $15 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2007
    compared with 2006.

CIPS

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $11 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because
    of increased bad debt expenses, higher distribution system
    reliability expenditures, and increased injuries and damages
    reserves. The reversal in 2007 of the Illinois Customer Elect
    electric rate increase phase-in plan accrual of $4 million
    established in 2006 reduced the effect of these increases. Costs
    associated with storms in the spring and summer of 2006 and a
    major ice storm in the fourth quarter of 2006 were comparable
    with the costs associated with an ice storm in January 2007.

CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated)

Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable
    between 2007 and 2006, as an increase in bad debt expenses was
    offset by the reversal of the Illinois Customer Elect electric
    rate increase phase-in plan accrual of $3 million
    established in 2006. Costs associated with storms had a minimal
    impact on CILCO (Illinois Regulated) other operations and
    maintenance expenses each year.

IP

IP’s other operations and maintenance expenses were
    comparable between 2007 and 2006. Higher employee benefit costs
    increased other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007. Bad
    debt expenses increased $10 million in 2007, primarily as a
    result of the transition to higher electric rates in Illinois.
    Offsetting the effect of these items was the reversal in 2007 of
    the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase-in plan
    accrual of $8 million established in 2006 and a reduction
    of $24 million in storm repair costs between years.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $30 million in the Non-rate-regulated Generation segment in
    2007 compared with 2006.

Genco

Genco’s other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $10 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because
    of higher labor costs, the IPA payment of $3 million, and
    insurance premiums for replacement power coverage paid to a risk
    insurance affiliate.

CILCORP (Parent
    Company only)

Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable
    between 2007 and 2006. Increased employee benefit costs in 2007
    were offset by the absence in 2007 of a write-off that occurred
    in 2006, of an intangible asset established in conjunction with
    Ameren’s acquisition of CILCORP.

CILCO (AERG)

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $11 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because
    of higher power plant maintenance costs due to plant outages and
    the IPA payment of $1.5 million.

EEI

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $3 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of
    higher power plant maintenance costs.

2006 versus

Ameren

Ameren’s other operations and maintenance expenses
    increased $69 million in 2006 compared with 2005. We
    experienced the most damaging storms in the Ameren
    utilities’ history in our service territory during the
    summer of 2006, resulting in the loss of power to about 950,000
    electric customers and expenses of $28 million. Severe ice
    storms in the fourth quarter of 2006 resulted in the loss of
    power to about 520,000 electric customers and expenses of
    $42 million. Additionally, other operations and maintenance
    expenses increased because of $25 million in costs related
    to the December 2005 reservoir breach at UE’s Taum Sauk
    plant and $15 million of contributions to assist
    residential customers in association with the Illinois Customer
    Elect electric rate increase phase-in plan accepted by the ICC
    in December 2006. In addition, there were higher maintenance
    expenses at our coal-fired power plants due to the timing of
    maintenance outages, and an increase in legal fees for
    environmental issues and general litigation. The effect on other
    operations and maintenance expenses from transactions related to
    noncore properties, including the impairment of a Delta Air
    Lines, Inc. lease in 2005, was comparable between years.

Reducing the unfavorable impact of the above items were lower
    labor costs and a decrease in bad debt expense of
    $17 million in 2006. An anticipated increase in
    uncollectible accounts due to higher natural gas prices was
    mitigated by mild winter weather. In 2005, a Callaway nuclear
    plant refueling and maintenance outage resulted in other
    operations and maintenance expenses of $31 million; there
    was no refueling and maintenance outage in 2006.

Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses for the
    Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren
    Companies between 2006 and 2005 are discussed below.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased in 2006 over
    2005, primarily because of storm repair



expenditures of $38 million, incremental costs associated
    with the Taum Sauk plant incident of $25 million, as noted
    above, and higher maintenance expenses at UE’s coal-fired
    power plants. Reducing the impact of these unfavorable items
    were decreased injury and damage expenses, decreased bad debt
    expenses, lower labor and employee benefit costs, and the lack
    of a scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage in
    2006, which resulted in other operations and maintenance
    expenses of $31 million in 2005. Additionally, other
    operations and maintenance expenses decreased $7 million in
    2006 as a result of the transfer of UE’s Illinois service
    territory to CIPS in May 2005.

Illinois
    Regulated

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $45 million in 2006 compared with 2005 in the Illinois
    Regulated segment, as detailed below.

CIPS

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $13 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of storm
    repair expenditures of $6 million and the transfer of
    UE’s Illinois service territory to CIPS in May 2005, which
    resulted in additional other operations and maintenance expenses
    of $7 million. Additionally, other operations and
    maintenance expenses increased because of contributions of
    $4 million associated with the Illinois Customer Elect
    electric rate increase phase-in plan in 2006. The negative
    impact of these items was reduced by lower bad debt expense.

CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated)

Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased
    $4 million in 2006 from 2005, primarily because of lower
    employee benefit costs and reduced bad debt expenses. Reducing
    the benefit of these items were $3 million of contributions
    associated with the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate
    increase phase-in plan and $5 million of storm repair and
    tree trimming expenditures in 2006.

IP

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $46 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of storm
    repair expenditures of $24 million and contributions
    associated with the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate
    increase phase-in plan of $8 million in 2006, along with
    higher rental expenses, and higher injury and damage expenses.
    The negative effect of these items was reduced by lower labor
    costs and employee benefit costs.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $28 million in 2006 compared with 2005 in the
    Non-rate-regulated Generation segment, as detailed below.

Genco

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $13 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of higher
    maintenance expenses resulting from more scheduled power plant
    maintenance outages in 2006.

CILCO (AERG)

Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable
    between 2006 and 2005, as decreased maintenance costs were
    offset by increased legal and environmental expenses.

CILCORP (Parent
    Company only) & EEI

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $8 million at CILCORP (Parent Company only) and
    $3 million at EEI in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of
    increased employee benefit costs.

Depreciation and
    Amortization

2007 versus

Ameren

Ameren’s depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $20 million in 2007 over 2006. The increases were primarily
    because of amortization of a regulatory asset in 2007 at IP, as
    discussed below, and capital additions in 2006 and 2007. A
    decrease in depreciation expenses as a result of a MoPSC
    electric rate order somewhat mitigated that effect. The MoPSC
    order extended the lives of UE’s Callaway nuclear plant and
    coal-fired generation plant for purposes of calculating
    depreciation expense, beginning in June 2007.

Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses for the
    Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren
    Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Depreciation and amortization expenses in 2007 were comparable
    with 2006. Increased expenses associated with capital additions
    in 2006 and 2007 were offset by a reduction in depreciation as a
    result of the MoPSC electric rate order noted above.

Illinois
    Regulated

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $25 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2007
    compared with 2006.

CIPS &
    CILCO (Illinois Regulated)

Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable between
    2007 and 2006.



IP

Depreciation and amortization expenses, including amortization
    of regulatory assets on IP’s statement of income, increased
    $19 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because
    of the start of amortization in 2007 of a regulatory asset
    associated with acquisition integration costs, as required by an
    ICC order, and capital additions.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable between
    2007 and 2006 in the Non-rate-regulated Generation segment and
    for Genco, CILCORP (Parent Company only), CILCO (AERG) and EEI.

2006 versus

Ameren

Ameren’s depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $29 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of capital
    additions.

Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses for the
    Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren
    Companies between 2006 and 2005 were as follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $25 million in 2006 over 2005. The increases were primarily
    because of capital additions, which included new steam
    generators and turbine rotors installed during the refueling and
    maintenance outage at the Callaway nuclear plant in 2005, as
    well as CTs purchased in the first quarter of 2006.
    Additionally, depreciation increased because CTs were
    transferred to UE from Genco in May 2005. Reducing depreciation
    expense was the property transfer to CIPS as part of the
    Illinois service territory transfer in May 2005.

Illinois
    Regulated

Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable in the
    Illinois Regulated segment, CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and IP
    in 2006 and 2005. Depreciation and amortization expenses
    increased $3 million at CIPS primarily because of property
    transferred from UE to CIPS as part of the Illinois service
    territory transfer in May 2005.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable in 2006
    and 2005 in the Non-rate-regulated Generation segment and for
    CILCORP (Parent Company only), Genco, CILCO (AERG), and EEI.

Taxes Other Than
    Income Taxes

2007 versus

Ameren

Ameren’s taxes other than income taxes decreased
    $10 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because
    of lower gross receipts and property taxes.

Variations in taxes other than income taxes for the Ameren,
    CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies
    between 2007 and 2006 were as follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Taxes other than income taxes increased $4 million in 2007
    over 2006, primarily because of increased gross receipts taxes.

Illinois
    Regulated

Taxes other than income taxes decreased $16 million in 2007
    compared with 2006 in the Illinois Regulated segment. Taxes
    other than income taxes decreased $7 million at CIPS,
    $2 million at CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and
    $7 million at IP in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily as a
    result of reduced property taxes and excise taxes.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Taxes other than income taxes were comparable between 2007 and
    2006 for the Non-rate-regulated Generation segment and for
    Genco, CILCORP (Parent Company only), CILCO (AERG), and EEI.

2006 versus

Ameren

Ameren’s taxes other than income taxes increased
    $26 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily as a result of
    higher gross receipts, and higher excise taxes and property
    taxes.

Variations in taxes other than income taxes for the Ameren,
    CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies
    between 2006 and 2005 were as follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Taxes other than income taxes were comparable in 2006 and 2005.

Illinois
    Regulated

In the Illinois Regulated segment, taxes other than income taxes
    increased $18 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Taxes
    other than income taxes increased $8 million at CIPS,
    $5 million at CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and
    $5 million at IP in 2006 over 2005, primarily as a result
    of higher property taxes and excise taxes.



Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

In the Non-rate-regulated Generation segment, taxes other than
    income taxes increased $7 million in 2006 compared with
    2005, primarily because of higher property taxes at Genco. A
    court decision in the first quarter of 2005 favorably affected
    taxes that year. Taxes other than income taxes were comparable
    in 2006 and 2005 at CILCORP (Parent Company only), CILCO (AERG),
    and EEI.

Other Income and
    Expenses

2007 versus

Ameren

Miscellaneous income increased $27 million in 2007 compared
    with 2006, primarily because of increased interest and
    investment income. Cash balances were higher because of
    uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of legislative and
    regulatory issues in Illinois. Miscellaneous expense increased
    $6 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because we
    made contributions to our charitable trust and because Illinois
    Regulated made contributions of $5 million for energy
    efficiency and customer assistance programs as part of the
    Illinois electric settlement agreement. See
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report.

Variations in other income and expenses for the Ameren, CILCORP
    and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between
    2007 and 2006 were as follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Other income and expenses were comparable in 2007 with 2006.

Illinois
    Regulated

Other income and expenses increased $6 million in the
    Illinois Regulated segment in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily
    because of increased interest income at IP. Other income and
    expenses were comparable between periods at CIPS and CILCO
    (Illinois Regulated).

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Other income and expenses were comparable between 2007 and 2006
    for the Non-rate-regulated Generation segment and for Genco,
    CILCORP (Parent Company only), CILCO (AERG), and EEI.

2006 versus

Ameren

Miscellaneous income increased $21 million in 2006 over
    2005, primarily because of $24 million of interest income
    on a taxable industrial development revenue bond acquired by UE
    in conjunction with its purchase of a CT in the first quarter of
    2006. This amount was offset by an equivalent amount of interest
    expense on Ameren’s and UE’s statements of income.
    Miscellaneous expense decreased $8 million, primarily
    because of decreased donations in 2006 and the write-off of
    unrecoverable natural gas costs in 2005.

Variations in other income and expenses for the Ameren, CILCORP
    and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between
    2006 and 2005 were as follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Miscellaneous income increased $16 million in 2006 over
    2005, primarily as a result of interest income on a taxable
    industrial development revenue bond acquired by UE in
    conjunction with its purchase of a CT as noted above. This
    favorable impact was partially offset by lower capitalization of
    equity funds used during construction in 2006. In 2005, UE
    replaced steam generators and turbine rotors at the Callaway
    nuclear plant. Miscellaneous expense was comparable in 2006 and
    2005.

Illinois
    Regulated

Other income and expenses were comparable for Illinois
    Regulated, CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and IP in 2006 and
    2005.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Other income and expenses were comparable for Non-rate-regulated
    Generation, Genco, CILCORP (Parent Company only), CILCO (AERG),
    and EEI in 2006 and 2005.

Interest

2007 versus

Ameren

Interest expense increased $73 million in 2007 compared
    with 2006, primarily because of increased short-term borrowings,
    higher interest rates due to reduced credit ratings, and other
    items noted below. With the adoption of FIN 48 in 2007, we
    also began to record interest associated with uncertain tax
    positions as interest expense in 2007 rather than income tax
    expense. These interest charges were $10 million for 2007.
    Reducing the effect of the above unfavorable items were
    maturities of $350 million of long-term debt in the first
    half of 2007 at Ameren and redemptions/maturities at the Ameren
    Companies as noted below.

Variations in interest expense for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO
    business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and
    2006 were as follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Interest expense increased $23 million in 2007 over 2006,
    primarily because of increased short-term borrowings, higher
    interest rates due to reduced credit ratings, and the issuance
    of $425 million of senior secured notes in June



2007. Interest expense recorded in conjunction with uncertain
    tax positions was $3 million in 2007.

Illinois
    Regulated

Interest expense increased $37 million in the Illinois
    Regulated segment and increased at CIPS and IP in 2007 compared
    with 2006, primarily because of increased short-term borrowings
    and higher interest rates due to reduced credit ratings and the
    issuance of senior secured notes in 2007 and 2006. IP issued
    $250 million and $75 million of senior secured notes
    in November 2007 and June 2006, respectively. CIPS and CILCO
    (Illinois Regulated) issued $61 million and
    $96 million of senior secured notes, respectively, in June
    2006. Reducing the effect of the above items was the maturity of
    $50 million of first mortgage bonds at CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated) in January 2007 and payments made on IP’s note
    payable to IP SPT in 2007 and 2006.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

Interest expense increased $4 million in the
    Non-rate-regulated Generation segment in 2007 compared with 2006.

CILCORP (Parent
    Company only) & CILCO (AERG)

Interest expense increased $3 million at CILCORP (Parent
    Company only) and $5 million at CILCO (AERG) in 2007 over
    2006, primarily because of increased short-term borrowings and
    higher interest rates due to reduced credit ratings.

Genco

Interest expense decreased $5 million in 2007 compared with
    2006, primarily because of reduced intercompany borrowings.
    Partially reducing this benefit was increased interest expense
    of $3 million recorded in conjunction with uncertain tax
    positions in 2007.

EEI

Interest expense was comparable in 2007 and 2006.

2006 versus

Ameren

Ameren’s interest expense increased $49 million in
    2006 over 2005, primarily because of items noted below for the
    Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for each of the
    Ameren Companies individually.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

Interest expense increased $55 million in 2006 over 2005.
    UE issued $300 million of senior secured notes in July 2005
    and $260 million of senior secured notes in December 2005.
    It also increased its short-term borrowings, partly in
    connection with the purchase of CTs in the first quarter of
    2006. Interest expense of $24 million was recognized on
    UE’s capital lease associated with one of these CTs. This
    amount was offset by an equivalent amount of interest income on
    industrial revenue bonds in Ameren’s and UE’s
    statements of income.

Illinois
    Regulated

In the Illinois Regulated segment, interest expense increased
    $9 million in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily because of
    the issuance of $75 million of senior secured notes in June
    2006 and increased money pool borrowings at IP. Interest expense
    at CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated) was comparable in 2006
    and 2005.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

In the Non-rate-regulated Generation segment, interest expense
    decreased $16 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Interest
    expense decreased $13 million at Genco resulting from the
    maturity of $225 million of its senior notes in 2005.
    Interest expense at CILCORP (Parent Company only), CILCO (AERG),
    and EEI was comparable in 2006 and 2005.

Income
    Taxes

2007 versus

Ameren

Ameren’s effective tax rate increased between 2007 and 2006.

Variations in effective tax rates for the Ameren, CILCORP and
    CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between
    2007 and 2006 were as follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

The effective tax rate decreased in 2007 from 2006, primarily
    because of the implementation of changes ordered by the MoPSC in
    UE’s 2007 electric rate order, which reduced the net
    amortization of

property-related

regulatory assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to 2006,
    decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2007
    compared to increases in 2006, and increased production activity
    deductions in 2007 compared to 2006.

Illinois
    Regulated

The effective tax rate decreased in the Illinois Regulated
    segment in 2007 compared with 2006, because of the items
    detailed below.

CIPS

The effective tax rate increased, primarily because of higher
    reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2007 compared to 2006,
    unfavorable net amortization of

property-related

regulatory assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to favorable
    net amortization of

property-related

regulatory assets and liabilities in 2006, lower permanent
    benefit for SFAS No. 106-2, as it relates to Medicare
    Part D provisions, and other



miscellaneous items, offset by the increased impact of the
    amortization of investment tax credit, and other items on lower
    pretax book income.

CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated)

The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of an
    increase in the permanent benefit for SFAS No.

106-2,

as it

    amortization of the property-related regulatory assets and
    liabilities, and increased impact of the amortization of
    investment tax credit on lower pretax book income.

IP

The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of favorable
    net amortization of property-related regulatory assets and
    liabilities in 2007 compared to unfavorable net amortization of
    property-related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2006.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

The effective tax rate increased in the Non-rate-regulated
    Generation segment in 2007 compared with 2006, because of items
    detailed below.

Genco

The effective tax rate increased, primarily because of lower

    compared to 2006, and decreased production activity deductions
    in 2007 compared to 2006.

CILCO (AERG)

The effective tax rate increased in 2007, primarily because of
    higher reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2007 compared to
    2006 and decreased impact of amortization of investment tax
    credit on higher pretax book income, offset by increased
    production activity deductions in 2007 compared to 2006, and
    differences between the book and tax treatment of the sales of
    noncore properties in 2006.

CILCORP (Parent
    Company only)

The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of a change
    in the permanent benefit for SFAS No. 106-2, as it relates

EEI

The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of increased
    production activity deductions.

2006 versus

Ameren

Ameren’s effective tax rate decreased in 2006 from 2005,
    primarily because of differences between the book and tax
    treatment of the sales of noncore properties, as well as the
    items discussed below.

Variations in effective tax rates for the Ameren, CILCORP and
    CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between
    2006 and 2005 were as follows.

Missouri
    Regulated

UE

The effective tax rate increased in 2006 over the prior year,
    primarily because of an increase in reserves for uncertain tax
    positions in 2006 compared to a decrease in 2005, and lower
    unfavorable net amortization of property-related regulatory
    assets and liabilities in 2006 compared to 2005.

Illinois
    Regulated

The effective tax rate decreased in 2006 from 2005 at Illinois
    Regulated, primarily because of the items detailed below.

CIPS

The effective tax rate decreased from the prior year, primarily
    because of favorable net amortization of property-related
    regulatory assets and liabilities and larger decreases in
    reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2006 compared to 2005,
    offset by lower permanent benefits for SFAS No. 106-2, as it
    relates to Medicare Part D provisions.

CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated)

The effective tax rate increased in 2006 over 2005, primarily
    because of lower permanent benefits related to company-owned
    life insurance and SFAS No. 106-2, as it relates to Medicare
    Part D provisions.

IP

The effective tax rate was comparable in 2006 and 2005.

Non-rate-regulated
    Generation

    Non-rate-regulated Generation, primarily because of the items
    detailed below.

Genco

The effective tax rate decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily
    because of the resolution of uncertain tax positions in 2006
    based on favorable developments with taxing authorities, and
    increased production activity deductions.

CILCO (AERG)

The effective tax rate decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily
    because of the resolution of uncertain tax positions in 2006
    based on favorable developments with taxing authorities compared
    to an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2005,
    as well as the difference between the book and tax treatment of
    the sales of noncore properties in 2006.



CILCORP (Parent
    Company only)

The effective tax rate decreased from the prior year, primarily
    because of a change in the permanent benefit of SFAS No. 106-2,
    as it relates to Medicare Part D provisions.

EEI

LIQUIDITY AND
    CAPITAL RESOURCES

The tariff-based gross margins of Ameren’s rate-regulated
    utility operating companies (UE, CIPS, CILCO (Illinois
    Regulated) and IP) continue to be the principal source of cash
    from operating activities for Ameren and its rate-regulated
    subsidiaries. A diversified retail customer mix of primarily
    rate-regulated residential, commercial and industrial classes
    and a commodity mix of gas and electric service provide a
    reasonably predictable source of cash flows for Ameren, UE,
    CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP. For operating cash
    flows, Genco and AERG rely principally on power sales to
    Marketing Company, which sold power to CIPS, CILCO and IP via
    the September 2006 Illinois power procurement auction and via
    financial contracts that were part of the Illinois electric
    settlement agreement. Marketing Company is also selling power
    through other primarily market-based contracts with wholesale
    and retail customers. In addition to cash flows from operating
    activities, the Ameren Companies use available cash, credit
    facilities, money pool or other short-term borrowings from
    affiliates or commercial paper to support normal operations and
    other temporary capital requirements. The use of operating cash
    flows and short-term borrowings to fund capital expenditures and
    other investments may periodically result in a working capital
    deficit, as was the case at December 31, 2007, for Ameren,
    Genco, CILCORP, and CILCO. The Ameren Companies may reduce their
    short-term borrowings with cash from operations or
    discretionarily with long-term borrowings, or in the case of
    Ameren subsidiaries, with equity infusions from Ameren. The
    Ameren Companies will incur significant capital expenditures
    over the next five years as they comply with environmental
    regulations and make significant investments in their electric
    and gas utility infrastructure to improve overall system
    reliability. Expenditures not funded with operating cash flows
    are expected to be funded primarily with debt. See
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report for a discussion of the Illinois electric settlement
    agreement, which among other things, will change the process for
    power procurement in Illinois and affect future cash flows of
    the Ameren Companies, except UE. The settlement resulted in
    customer refunds and credits during 2007, and it will result in
    further credits to customers through 2010. The Ameren Illinois
    Utilities will receive reimbursement for most of these refunds
    and credits from Illinois power generators, including Genco and
    AERG.

Cash Flows from
    Operating Activities

2007 versus

Ameren’s cash from operating activities decreased in 2007,
    as compared with 2006. This was primarily because of an increase
    in working capital investment as the collection of higher
    electric rates from Illinois electric customers lagged payments
    for power purchases, and past-due accounts increased because of
    the higher rates. The Illinois electric settlement agreement
    resulted in a 2007 net cash outflow of $88 million:
    $211 million of customer refunds, credits, and program
    funding, minus related reimbursements from nonaffiliated
    Illinois generators of $123 million. As of the end of 2007,
    $34 million was due from nonaffiliated generators. See
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report for a complete discussion of the Illinois electric
    settlement agreement. Other factors also reduced cash flow:
    increased interest payments as a result of lower credit ratings
    and increased debt. In addition, cash spent for fuel inventory
    increased because UE increased its inventory, and AERG
    experienced increased inventory as a result of an extended plant
    outage. Also reducing operating cash flows was a
    $25 million increase in pension and postretirement benefit
    contributions. In 2007, a $120 million decrease in income
    taxes paid (net of refunds) benefited cash flows from operations
    in 2007. Increases in electric and gas margins of
    $296 million and $15 million, respectively, also
    benefited operating cash flows, but were reduced by higher
    operations and maintenance expenses, as discussed in Results of
    Operations.



At UE, cash from operating activities decreased in 2007,
    compared with 2006, primarily because of an increase in accounts
    receivable caused by higher prices for interchange power sales,
    colder weather in December 2007 than in December 2006, and
    increased electric rates. Further reducing cash flows in 2007
    was an increase in interest payments and other operations and
    maintenance expenditures, including $35 million for the
    Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage. In
    addition, UE increased its fuel inventory. Compared with 2006,
    cash flows from operations in 2007 benefited from an increase in
    margin, as discussed in Results of Operations, a decrease in
    cash paid for Taum Sauk incident-related costs (net of insurance
    recoveries) of $60 million, and a decrease in income tax
    payments (net of refunds) of $86 million.

At CIPS, cash from operating activities decreased in 2007,
    compared with 2006. The Illinois electric settlement agreement
    resulted in a 2007 net cash outflow of $31 million,
    including $74 million of customer refunds, credits, and
    program funding, and related reimbursements from nonaffiliated
    Illinois generators of $43 million. As of the end of 2007,
    $13 million was due from nonaffiliated generators. See
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report for a complete discussion of the Illinois electric
    settlement agreement. Cash from operations was further reduced
    by a decrease in electric margins and higher expenses, as
    discussed in Results of Operations. In addition, there was an
    increase in working capital investment, as the collection of
    higher electric rates from customers lagged payments for power
    purchases, and past-due customer accounts increased because of
    higher rates. Income tax payments (net of refunds) decreased
    $44 million, benefiting cash flows from operations.

Genco’s cash from operating activities increased in 2007
    compared with 2006, primarily because electric margins were up,
    as discussed in Results of Operations, and because cash spent
    for fuel inventory was down. In 2006, large cash outlays were
    made to replenish coal inventory after delivery disruptions
    caused by train derailments. Reducing these increases in cash
    from operating activities was an increase in income tax payments
    (net of refunds) of $27 million.

Cash from operating activities decreased for CILCORP and CILCO
    in 2007, compared with 2006. The Illinois electric settlement
    agreement resulted in a 2007 net cash outflow of
    $17 million: $41 million of customer refunds, credits,
    and program funding, minus related reimbursements from
    nonaffiliated Illinois generators of $24 million. As of the
    end of 2007, $7 million was due from nonaffiliated
    generators. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory
    Matters to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for a complete discussion of the
    Illinois electric settlement agreement. Working capital
    investment increased because the collection of higher electric
    rates from customers lagged payments for power purchases,
    past-due customer accounts increased due to higher rates, and
    inventory levels increased at AERG due to an extended plant
    outage. In addition, income tax payments (net of refunds)
    increased $16 million for CILCORP and $15 million for
    CILCO. Increased electric and gas margins, as discussed in
    Results of Operations, benefited cash flows from operating
    activities.

IP’s cash from operating activities decreased in 2007,
    compared with 2006. The Illinois electric settlement agreement
    resulted in a 2007 net cash outflow of $40 million:
    $96 million of customer refunds, credits, and program
    funding, minus related reimbursements from nonaffiliated
    Illinois generators of $56 million. As of the end of 2007,
    $14 million was due from nonaffiliated generators. See
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report for a complete discussion of the Illinois electric
    settlement agreement. Further reducing cash from operating
    activities compared to the prior year was a reduction in
    electric margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, and a
    $13 million increase in pension and postretirement benefit
    contributions. Working capital investment increased because the
    collection of higher electric rates from customers lagged
    payments for power purchases, and past-due customer accounts
    increased because of higher rates. Income tax payments (net of
    refunds) increased by $15 million, further reducing cash
    flows from operations.

2006 versus

Ameren’s cash from operations increased in 2006, compared
    with 2005. As discussed in Results of Operations, electric
    margins increased by $41 million, while gas margins
    decreased by $24 million. Benefiting operating cash flows
    in 2006 was an $84 million decrease in pension and
    postretirement benefit contributions. IP also collected
    higher-than-normal trade receivables in 2006 because of the
    especially cold December 2005 weather during the winter heating
    season. The cash impact from trade receivables was more
    significant in 2006 because we had higher gas prices and colder
    December 2005 weather. Negative impacts on operating cash flow
    include a $216 million increase in income tax payments,
    expenditures of $59 million (including a $10 million
    FERC fine) associated with the breach of the upper reservoir at
    UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility in
    December 2005, and $37 million of other operations and
    maintenance expenses due to severe storms. Most of the Taum Sauk
    expenditures were pending recovery from insurance carriers at
    the end of 2006. In addition, there was an increase in cash used
    during 2006 for payment of 2005 costs, including $9 million
    for other operations and maintenance and $14 million for
    annual incentive compensation. These expenses were higher in
    2006 than they were in 2005, because of increased 2005 earnings
    relative to performance targets. The cash benefit from reduced
    natural gas inventories as a result of lower prices was offset
    by increased volume of coal inventory purchases, because of the
    coal supply delivery issues experienced in 2005. See
    Note 13 – Commitments and
    Contingencies – Pumped-storage Hydroelectric Facility
    Breach to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for more information regarding the
    Taum Sauk incident.



At UE, cash from operating activities increased in 2006. Overall
    margins were higher in 2006 than in 2005. Other operations and
    maintenance expenses were comparable with the previous
    year’s, despite $59 million (including
    $10 million for a FERC fine) spent due to the breach of the
    upper reservoir at UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage
    hydroelectric facility as discussed above for Ameren, and
    $24 million spent due to severe storms. Pension and
    postretirement benefit contributions were $61 million less
    than in the prior year. Income tax payments increased
    $51 million, and interest payments increased
    $40 million because of increased outstanding debt. Cash
    used for coal purchases increased in 2006 to alleviate the coal
    supply delivery issues experienced in 2005. Cash used for
    working capital increased, largely because of storm-related
    costs.

At CIPS, cash from operating activities decreased from the prior
    year. The negative cash effect of higher other operations and
    maintenance expenses was reduced by a small increase in electric
    and gas margins, as discussed in Results of Operations. Income
    tax payments increased $55 million in 2006 compared with
    2005. Reducing this use of cash was a decrease in pension and
    postretirement benefit contributions of $11 million in 2006
    compared with 2005, and an increase in collections of trade
    receivables as a result of colder December 2005 weather and
    higher gas prices than in the year-ago period.

Genco’s cash from operating activities in 2006 decreased
    compared with the 2005 period, primarily because of lower
    operating margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, and
    increases in coal inventory. Income tax payments decreased by
    $17 million in 2006, pension and postretirement benefit
    payments decreased $9 million, and interest payments were
    lower because there was less debt outstanding.

Cash from operating activities increased for CILCORP and CILCO
    in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily because of higher electric
    margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, and an increase
    in collections of trade receivables as a result of colder
    December 2005 weather and higher gas prices than in 2004. In
    addition, income tax payments decreased $25 million for
    CILCORP and $17 million for CILCO. An increase in coal
    deliveries at CILCO’s subsidiary, AERG, negatively affected
    cash.

IP’s cash from operations increased in 2006, compared with
    2005. Benefiting 2006 cash flows were the collection of
    higher-than-normal trade receivables caused by cold December
    2005 weather, as discussed above for Ameren, and a
    $1 million decrease in pension and postretirement benefit
    payments. These increases were reduced by lower electric margins
    and higher other operations and maintenance expenses, including
    $9 million related to severe storms, net income tax refunds
    of $13 million in 2006 compared with $22 million in
    2005, and cash used in 2006 for payment of 2005 costs, as
    discussed above for Ameren, including an increase of
    $7 million in other operations and maintenance expenses,
    and an increase of $3 million in incentive compensation.

Pension
    Funding

Ameren’s pension plans are funded in compliance with income
    tax regulations and federal funding requirements. In May 2007,
    the MoPSC issued an electric rate order that allows UE to
    recover through customer rates the pension expense it incurred
    under GAAP. Consequently, Ameren expects to fund its pension
    plans at a level equal to the total pension expense. Based on
    Ameren’s assumptions at December 31, 2007, and
    reflecting this pension funding policy, Ameren expects to make
    annual voluntary contributions of $40 million to
    $65 million in each of the next five years. We expect
    UE’s, CIPS’, Genco’s, CILCO’s, and IP’s
    portion of the future funding requirements to be 65%, 8%, 11%,
    5% and 11%, respectively. These amounts are estimates; the
    numbers may change with actual stock market performance, changes
    in interest rates, any pertinent changes in government
    regulations, and any voluntary contributions. See
    Note 9 – Retirement Benefits to our financial
    statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for
    additional information.

Cash Flows from
    Investing Activities

2007 versus

Ameren used more cash for investing activities in 2007 than in
    2006. Net cash used for capital expenditures increased in 2007
    as a result of power plant scrubber installation projects, other
    upgrades at various power plants, and reliability improvements
    of the transmission and distribution systems, but this increase
    was reduced by the absence in 2007 of CT acquisitions that
    occurred in 2006. The $43 million decrease in 2007 of
    proceeds from sales of noncore properties also increased net
    cash used in investing activities. An $18 million decrease
    in emission allowance purchases benefited cash flows from
    investing activities, while cash received in 2007 for emission
    allowance sales was $66 million less than in the prior
    year, because remaining allowances are expected to be retained
    for environmental compliance needs.

UE’s cash used in investing activities decreased in 2007,
    compared with 2006, principally because of the $292 million
    expended for CT purchases in 2006 that was not spent in 2007.
    Otherwise, capital expenditures increased $135 million
    because of storm repair costs, a power plant scrubber
    installation project, and other upgrades at various power
    plants. Other impacts on cash used in investing activities were
    the absence of sales of noncore properties in 2007 compared with
    a $13 million sale in 2006, and the 2006 receipt of
    $67 million in proceeds from an intercompany note related
    to the transfer of UE’s Illinois territory to CIPS.
    Additionally, nuclear fuel expenditures increased
    $29 million in 2007 over 2006 because of a refueling
    outage, and sales of emission allowances decreased
    $35 million because remaining allowances are being retained
    for environmental compliance needs.

CIPS’ cash used in investing activities decreased in 2007,
    compared with 2006. CIPS’ investing cash flow was
    positively affected by a $3 million increase in proceeds
    from



CIPS’ note receivable from
    Genco in 2007 compared with 2006 and the lack of a 2006
    $17 million expenditure to repurchase its own outstanding
    bond. Capital expenditures were $3 million lower in 2007
    than in 2006.

Genco had an increase in net cash used in investing activities
    for 2007, compared with 2006. This increase was due primarily to
    a $106 million increase in capital expenditures related to
    a scrubber project at one of its power plants and various other
    plant upgrades. Emission allowance purchases decreased by
    $6 million.

CILCORP’s and CILCO’s cash used in investing
    activities increased in 2007, compared with 2006. Cash flow used
    in investing activities increased as a result of a
    $135 million increase in capital expenditures, primarily
    due to a power plant scrubber project and other plant upgrades
    at AERG. The absence in 2007 of $11 million of proceeds
    received in 2006 from the sale of leveraged leases, and (for
    CILCORP only) the absence in 2007 of a 2006 note receivable
    payment from Resources Company in the amount of $71 million
    related to the 2005 transfer of leveraged leases from CILCORP to
    Resources Company, contributed to the increase in cash used in
    investing activities in 2007. The net year-over-year reduction
    of $84 million and $82 million in money pool advances
    for CILCO and CILCORP, respectively, and a $12 million
    reduction of emission allowance purchases benefited cash flows
    from investing activities in 2007.

IP’s net use of cash in investing activities for 2007 was
    comparable with 2006.

See Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to
    our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for a further discussion of future environmental
    capital investment estimates.

2006 versus

Ameren’s increase in cash used in investing activities was
    primarily due to UE’s 2006 purchases of a

640-megawatt

CT facility from affiliates of NRG Energy Inc. and 510-megawatt
    and 340-megawatt CT facilities from subsidiaries of Aquila Inc.,
    for a total of $292 million; increased nuclear fuel
    expenditures of $22 million; and $96 million of
    capital expenditures during 2006 related to the severe storms.
    The CT purchases were intended to meet UE’s increased
    generating capacity needs and to provide UE with additional
    flexibility in determining the timing of future baseload
    generating capacity additions. Emission allowance purchases
    decreased $50 million in 2006 compared with 2005, while
    emission allowance sales increased $49 million. The sale of
    noncore properties in 2006 provided a $56 million benefit
    to Ameren’s cash from investing activities.

UE’s cash used in investing activities decreased in 2006,
    compared with 2005, principally because of a decrease in capital
    expenditures at the Callaway nuclear plant. This is due to UE
    spending $221 million for planned upgrades during a
    scheduled refueling outage in 2005. In addition, in 2006 UE
    received $67 million from CIPS as repayment of an
    intercompany note. The cash effect of the $292 million in
    CT purchases discussed above was more than the prior-year effect
    of the $237 million purchase of two CTs from Genco and the
    purchase of CT equipment from Development Company for
    $25 million. UE’s capital expenditures related to the
    2006 severe storms were $47 million. In 2006, UE had a
    $13 million gain on the sale of a noncore property, and a
    $35 million increase in sales of emission allowances.

CIPS’ cash used in investing activities increased in 2006,
    compared with 2005. Capital expenditures increased
    $18 million. Also negatively affecting CIPS’ investing
    cash flow was an $18 million reduction in proceeds from
    CIPS’ note receivable from Genco in 2006. In addition, CIPS
    paid $17 million to repurchase its own outstanding bond.
    The bond remains outstanding, and CIPS is currently the holder
    and debtor. The increased capital expenditures resulted partly
    from CIPS’ expansion of its service territory because of
    its acquisition of UE’s Illinois utility operations in May
    2005. In addition, $16 million was expended as a result of
    storms. CIPS’ remaining capital expenditures were for
    projects to improve the reliability of its electric and gas
    transmission and distribution systems.

Genco had a net use of cash in investing activities for 2006,
    compared with a net source of cash for 2005. This was due
    primarily to the 2005 sale of two CTs to UE for
    $241 million. Purchases of emission allowances were
    $45 million less in 2006 than in 2005. Capital expenditures
    increased $9 million for 2006 compared with 2005.

CILCORP’s cash used in investing activities decreased, and
    CILCO’s increased in 2006, compared with 2005. Capital
    expenditures increased $12 million for CILCORP and CILCO,
    and net money pool advances decreased for each company by
    $42 million. CILCORP’s cash from investing activities
    further benefited from the repayment of Resources Company’s
    note for $71 million, which originated from the 2005
    transfer of leveraged leases from CILCORP to Resources Company.
    In addition, a subsidiary of CILCORP and CILCO generated cash
    from investing activities of $11 million in 2006, from the
    sale of its remaining leveraged lease investments. Emission
    allowance purchases were $9 million less in 2006 than in
    2005.

IP had a net use of cash in investing activities for 2006,
    compared with a net source of cash for 2005, primarily because
    of the absence in 2006 of the 2005 repayments for advances made
    to the money pool in prior-periods. In addition, capital
    expenditures increased $47 million over the year-ago
    period, which included $27 million as a result of severe
    storms, and increased expenditures to maintain the reliability
    of IP’s electric and gas transmission and distribution
    systems.

Intercompany
    Transfer of Illinois Service Territory

On May 2, 2005, UE completed the transfer of its
    Illinois-based electric and natural gas service territory to
    CIPS, at a net book value of $133 million. UE transferred
    50% of the assets directly to CIPS in consideration for a CIPS
    subordinated promissory note in the principal amount



of $67 million and 50% of the assets by means of a dividend
    in kind to Ameren, followed by a capital contribution by Ameren
    to CIPS. The remaining principal balance of $61 million
    under the note was repaid in full by CIPS in June 2006.

Ameren’s 2007 capital expenditures principally consisted of
    the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE spent
    $101 million toward a scrubber at one of its power plants,
    and incurred storm damage expenditures of $56 million. IP
    incurred storm damage-related expenditures of $24 million.
    At Genco and AERG there were cash outlays of $102 million
    and $76 million, respectively, for scrubber projects. The
    scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental
    regulations. AERG also made expenditures for a boiler upgrade of
    $45 million. Other capital expenditures were principally to
    maintain, upgrade and expand the reliability of the transmission
    and distribution systems of UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP as well as
    various plant upgrades.

Ameren’s 2006 capital expenditures principally consisted of
    the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE purchased
    three CTs totaling $292 million. In addition, UE spent
    $40 million toward a scrubber at one of its power plants,
    and incurred storm damage expenditures of $47 million. CIPS
    and IP incurred storm damage-related expenditures of
    $16 million and $27 million, respectively. At Genco
    and AERG there was a cash outlay of $24 million and
    $11 million, respectively, for scrubber projects. Genco
    also made expenditures for a boiler upgrade of $16 million.
    Other capital expenditures were principally to maintain, upgrade
    and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution
    systems of UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP.

Ameren’s 2005 capital expenditures principally consisted of
    the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE’s
    capital expenditures for 2005 principally consisted of
    $221 million for steam generators, low pressure rotor
    replacements, and other upgrades during the 2005 refueling and
    maintenance outage at its Callaway nuclear plant. UE also
    incurred expenditures of $65 million for three CTs at its
    Venice plant, $60 million for numerous projects at its
    generating plants, and $45 million for various upgrades to
    its transmission and distribution system. In addition, UE
    incurred expenditures of $237 million for CTs purchased
    from Genco, as discussed above. CILCORP’s and CILCO’s
    capital expenditures included $29 million for ongoing
    generation plant projects to improve flexibility in future fuel
    supply for power generation. In addition, CILCO, CIPS, and IP
    incurred expenditures to maintain, upgrade and expand the
    reliability of their electric and gas transmission and
    distribution systems.

The following table estimates the capital expenditures that will
    be incurred by the Ameren Companies from 2008 through 2012,
    including construction expenditures, capitalized interest and
    allowance for funds used during construction (except for Genco,
    which has no allowance for funds used during construction), and
    estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental

UE’s estimated capital expenditures include transmission,
    distribution and generation-related activities, as well as
    expenditures for compliance with new environmental regulations
    discussed below.

CIPS’, CILCO’s, and IP’s estimated capital
    expenditures are primarily for electric and gas transmission and
    distribution-related activities. Genco’s estimated capital
    expenditures are primarily for compliance with environmental
    regulations and upgrades to existing coal and gas-fired
    generating facilities. CILCO (AERG)’s estimate includes
    capital expenditures primarily for compliance with environmental
    regulations at AERG’s generating facilities, as well as
    generation-related activities.

We continually review our generation portfolio and expected
    power needs. As a result, we could modify our plan for
    generation capacity, which could include changing the times when
    certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio,
    the type of generation asset technology that will be employed,
    and whether capacity or power may be purchased, among other
    things. Any changes that we may plan to make for future
    generating needs could result in significant capital
    expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material.

Environmental
    Capital Expenditures

Ameren, UE, Genco, AERG and EEI will incur significant costs in
    future years to comply with EPA and state regulations regarding
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions (the Clean Air



Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions (the Clean Air Mercury
    Rule) from coal-fired power plants.

In May 2005, the EPA issued final regulations with respect to
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions
    (the Clean Air Mercury Rule) from coal-fired power plants. The
    rules require significant reductions in these emissions from UE,
    Genco, AERG and EEI power plants in phases, beginning in 2009.
    States have finalized rules to implement the federal Clean Air
    Interstate Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule. Illinois has
    finalized rules to implement the federal Clean Air Interstate
    Rule program that will reduce the number of
    NO

x

allowances automatically allocated to Genco’s, AERG’s
    and EEI’s plants. As a result of the Illinois rules, Genco,
    AERG and EEI will need to procure allowances and install
    pollution control equipment. Current plans include the
    installation of scrubbers for
    SO


reduction and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems for
    NO

x

reduction at certain coal-fired plants in Illinois.

Missouri rules, which substantially follow the federal
    regulations, became effective in April 2007. As a result of the
    Missouri rules, UE will manage allowances and install pollution
    control equipment. Current plans include the installation of
    scrubbers for
    SO


reduction and co-benefit reduction of mercury and pollution
    control equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions at
    certain coal-fired plants in Missouri.

Illinois has adopted rules for mercury emissions that are
    significantly stricter than the federal regulations. In 2006,
    Genco, CILCO, EEI, and the Illinois EPA entered into an
    agreement that was incorporated into Illinois’ mercury
    emission regulations. Under the regulations, Illinois generators
    may defer until 2015 the requirement to reduce mercury emissions
    by 90% in exchange for accelerated installation of
    NO

x

and
    SO


controls. In 2009, Genco, AERG and EEI will begin putting into
    service equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions.

In February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    District of Columbia issued a decision that effectively vacated
    the federal Clean Air Mercury rule. The court ruled that the EPA
    erred in the method used to remove electric generating units
    from the list of sources subject to the maximum available
    control technology requirements under the Clean Air Act. The
    Court’s decision is subject to appeal and it is uncertain
    how the EPA will respond. At this time, we are unable to
    determine the impact that this action would have on our
    estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental rules,
    our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

The table below presents estimated capital costs based on
    current technology to comply with both the federal Clean Air
    Interstate Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule through 2017 and
    related state implementation plans. The estimates described
    below could change, depending upon additional federal or state
    requirements, new technology, variations in costs of material or
    labor, or alternative compliance strategies, among other
    reasons. The timing of estimated capital costs may also be
    influenced by whether emission allowances are used to comply
    with the proposed rules, thereby deferring capital investment.

UE’s expenditures are expected
    to be recoverable in rates over time.

Illinois and Missouri must also develop attainment plans to meet
    the federal

eight-hour

ozone ambient standard, the federal fine particulate ambient
    standard, and the Clean Air Visibility rule. Both states have
    filed ozone attainment plans for the St. Louis area. The
    state attainment plans for fine particulate matter must be
    submitted to the EPA by April 2008. The plans for the Clean Air
    Visibility rule were submitted in December 2007. The costs in
    the table above assume that emission controls required for the
    Clean Air Interstate Rule regulations will be sufficient to meet
    these new standards in the St. Louis region. Should
    Missouri develop an alternative plan to comply with these
    standards, the cost impact could be material to UE, but we
    expect these costs to be recoverable from ratepayers. Illinois
    is planning to impose additional requirements beyond the Clean
    Air Interstate Rule as part of the attainment plans for ozone
    and fine particulate matter. At this time, we are unable to
    determine the impact that state actions would have on our
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

The impact that future initiatives related to greenhouse gas
    emissions and global warming may have on us is unknown and
    therefore not included in the estimated environmental
    expenditures. Although compliance costs are unlikely in the near
    future, our costs of complying with any mandated federal or
    state greenhouse gas program could have a material impact on our
    future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

See Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to
    our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for a further discussion of environmental matters.

Cash Flows from
    Financing Activities

2007 versus

Ameren had an increase of $556 million in its net cash from
    financing activities in 2007, compared to 2006. Positive effects
    on cash included a net increase of $441 million in net
    short-term debt proceeds in 2007 over 2006, and a



$442 million increase in the issuance of long-term debt.
    These increased proceeds were used to fund a $324 million
    increase in redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of
    long-term debt and to fund the working capital needs of UE,
    CIPS, CILCO and IP.

UE had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2007,
    compared with a net use of cash in 2006. The primary reasons for
    the change include a $380 million capital contribution from
    Ameren and the issuance of $424 million of long-term debt
    in 2007. The proceeds were used to repay short-term debt and to
    fund working capital and capital expenditures. Other net uses of
    cash in 2007 included the repayment of a note Ameren issued in
    2006 and an $18 million increase in dividend payments.

CIPS had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2007,
    compared with a net use of cash in 2006. This was primarily the
    result of an increase of $55 million in net short-term debt
    proceeds in 2007 over 2006, and a $10 million decrease in
    dividend payments. Cash was also positively affected in 2007 by
    a $20 million decrease in redemptions, repurchases, and
    maturities of long-term debt and the absence in 2007 of the 2006
    payments of $67 million on an intercompany note with UE.
    Cash flows in 2006 benefited from $61 million in proceeds
    from long-term debt issuances that did not recur in 2007.

Genco had a net increase in cash used in financing activities
    for 2007 over 2006, principally because of a $125 million
    decrease in capital contributions received from Ameren. Cash
    benefited in 2007 by a $100 million increase in net
    proceeds from short-term debt.

CILCORP had a net source of cash from financing activities in
    2007, compared with a net use of cash in 2006. CILCO’s cash
    provided by financing activities increased in 2007, compared
    with 2006. Net money pool repayments decreased $154 million
    at CILCORP and $161 million at CILCO. A net increase in
    short-term debt of $90 million at CILCORP and
    $15 million at CILCO in 2007 resulted in a positive effect
    on cash. In 2007, CILCORP and CILCO did not issue any dividends
    on common stock; in 2006 CILCORP issued $50 million and
    CILCO $65 million. As a result, cash flows from financing
    activities benefited in 2007 as compared to 2006. Additionally,
    in 2006 a note payable to Ameren was repaid, which resulted in a
    net use of cash of $113 million at CILCORP. Note payable
    repayments were only $71 million in 2007. These positive
    effects on cash were reduced by the lack of proceeds from the
    issuance of long-term debt in 2007 compared with
    $96 million at both CILCORP and CILCO in 2006.

IP had an increase in its net cash provided by financing
    activities in 2007 compared with 2006. This was primarily the
    result of an increase in proceeds from short-term debt and a
    $175 million increase from the issuance of long-term debt.
    The proceeds from the 2007 long-term debt issuance were used to
    repay borrowings under the Ameren utility money pool and under
    the 2007 credit facility. Other net uses of cash included
    $61 million of common stock dividends in 2007.

2006 versus

Ameren had a net source of cash from financing activities in
    2006, compared with a net use of cash in 2005. Positive effects
    on cash included a net increase of $419 million in net
    short-term debt proceeds in 2006, compared with net repayments
    of $224 million of short-term debt in 2005, and a
    $454 million decrease in long-term debt redemptions,
    repurchases and maturities. Negative effects on cash included a
    $411 million reduction in long-term debt proceeds from the
    year-ago period, and a $358 million reduction in proceeds
    from the issuance of common stock. The reduction in common stock
    proceeds was due to the issuance of 7.4 million shares in
    the 2005 period related to the settlement of a stock purchase
    obligation in Ameren’s adjustable conversion-rate equity
    security units.

UE had a net use of cash for financing activities in 2006,
    compared with a net source of cash in 2005. The absence of
    long-term debt issuances in 2006, compared with
    $643 million of long-term debt issuances in 2005, was the
    primary reason for the change. This negative effect on cash flow
    was reduced by net changes in short-term debt that resulted in a
    $154 million positive effect on cash in 2006, compared with
    a $295 million negative effect on cash in 2005. In
    addition, dividend payments decreased $31 million in the
    2006 period from 2005, and net money pool borrowings increased
    $79 million. Cash from financing activities in 2006 was
    used principally to fund CT acquisitions.

CIPS’ cash used in financing activities decreased in 2006,
    compared with 2005, principally because of the issuance of
    $61 million of long-term debt that was used with other
    available corporate funds to repay CIPS’ outstanding
    balance on the intercompany note payable to UE. That note was
    originally issued as 50% of the consideration for UE’s
    Illinois service territory, which was transferred to CIPS in
    2005. Cash was also positively affected by a $64 million
    net decrease in money pool repayments and borrowings of
    $35 million under the 2006 $500 million credit
    facility in 2006. A $15 million increase in dividends to
    Ameren negatively affected CIPS’ cash from financing
    activities in 2006.

Genco had a net decrease in cash used in financing activities
    for 2006, compared with 2005, principally because of
    $200 million of capital contributions received in 2006 from
    Ameren. These capital contributions were made to reduce
    Genco’s money pool borrowings. In 2005, Genco used the
    $241 million from the sale of CTs to UE along with other
    funds to retire $225 million of maturing debt and to make
    principal payments on intercompany notes with CIPS and Ameren.
    Reducing these positive effects on cash was a $25 million
    increase in dividend payments in 2006.

CILCORP had a net use of cash in 2006, compared with a net
    source of cash in 2005. CILCO’s cash provided by financing
    activities decreased in 2006. Net money pool repayments
    increased $142 million at CILCORP and $145 million at
    CILCO. CILCORP’s net repayments of $113 million on its
    note payable to Ameren reduced its



financing cash flow by $227 million, because 2005 included
    net borrowings on this note that provided CILCORP with cash.
    Positive effects on cash flow included long-term debt issuances
    that generated $96 million in 2006, compared with no
    long-term debt issuances in 2005. The proceeds from this debt
    were used to redeem $21 million of long-term debt and to
    reduce money pool borrowings. In addition, CILCORP borrowed
    $215 million and CILCO (and CILCO’s subsidiary AERG)
    borrowed $165 million under the 2006 $500 million
    credit facility, net of repayments. In 2006, CILCORP used cash
    of $33 million for redemptions, repurchases and maturities
    of long-term debt, compared with $101 million in the 2005
    period. CILCO’s cash used for redemptions, repurchases and
    maturities of long-term debt was comparable in the two years.
    These positive effects on cash in 2006 were partially offset by
    the absence in 2006 of a $102 million capital contribution
    received in 2005 from Ameren, which was made to reduce
    CILCO’s short-term debt. Also contributing to
    CILCORP’s and CILCO’s increase in cash used in
    financing activities for 2006 were increased common stock
    dividends of $20 million at CILCORP and $45 million at
    CILCO.

IP had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2006,
    compared with a net use of cash in 2005. This was partly because
    of lower redemptions and repurchases of long-term debt of
    $70 million in 2006. More debt was repaid in 2005 to
    improve IP’s credit profile. Other positive effects on cash
    from financing activities included the absence in 2006 of
    $76 million of common stock dividend payments made in 2005,
    net borrowings of $75 million on the 2006 $500 million
    credit facility, and the issuance of $75 million of
    long-term debt in 2006 compared with no long-term debt proceeds
    in 2005. The $75 million was used to reduce money pool
    borrowings.

Short-term
    Borrowings and Liquidity

Short-term borrowings typically consist of drawings under
    committed bank credit facilities and commercial paper issuances.
    See Note 4 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity to
    our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for additional information on credit facilities,
    short-term borrowing activity, relevant interest rates, and
    borrowings under Ameren’s utility and non-state-regulated
    subsidiary money pool arrangements.

The following table presents the various committed bank credit
    facilities of the Ameren Companies and AERG, and their
    availability as of December 31, 2007:

Ameren can directly borrow under the $1.15 billion
    facility, as amended, up to the entire amount of the facility.
    UE can directly borrow under this facility up to
    $500 million on a

364-day

basis. Genco can directly borrow under this facility up to
    $150 million on a

364-day

basis. The amended facility will terminate on July 14,
    2010, with respect to Ameren. The termination date for UE and
    Genco is July 10, 2008, subject to the annual

364-day

renewal provisions of the facility. This facility was also
    available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short-term
    borrowing authorizations, by EEI or other Ameren
    non-state-regulated subsidiaries through direct short-term
    borrowings from Ameren and by most of Ameren’s
    non-rate-regulated subsidiaries, including, but not limited to,
    Ameren Services, Resources Company, Genco, AERG, Marketing
    Company and AFS, through a non-state-regulated subsidiary money
    pool agreement. Ameren has money pool agreements with and among
    its subsidiaries to coordinate and to provide for certain
    short-term cash and working capital requirements. Separate money
    pools are maintained for utility and non-state-regulated
    entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement among
    Ameren, IP, and Ameren Services enables IP to make short-term
    borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of
    borrowings outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral
    borrowing agreement and the utility money pool agreement,
    together with any outstanding external short-



term borrowings by IP, may not
    exceed $500 million, pursuant to authorization from the
    ICC. IP is not currently borrowing under the unilateral
    borrowing agreement.

Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration
    of the money pool agreements. See Note 4 – Credit
    Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed
    explanation of the money pool arrangements and the unilateral
    borrowing agreement.

In addition to committed credit facilities, a further source of
    liquidity for the Ameren Companies from time to time is
    available cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2007,
    Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP had
    $355 million, $185 million, $26 million,
    $2 million, $6 million, $6 million and
    $6 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents.

The issuance of short-term debt securities by Ameren’s
    utility subsidiaries is subject to approval by FERC under the
    Federal Power Act. In March 2006, FERC issued an order
    authorizing these utility subsidiaries to issue short-term debt
    securities subject to the following limits on outstanding
    balances: UE – $1 billion, CIPS –
    $250 million, and CILCO – $250 million. The
    authorization was effective as of April 1, 2006, and
    terminates on March 31, 2008. An application for renewal of
    this authorization through March 31, 2010, is pending with
    FERC. IP has unlimited short-term debt authorization from FERC.

Genco is authorized by a March 2006 FERC order to have up to
    $300 million of short-term debt outstanding at any time. In
    the application to FERC for renewal authorization referred to
    above, Genco has requested to increase its short-term debt
    authorization to $500 million. AERG and EEI have unlimited
    short-term debt authorization from FERC.

The issuance of short-term unsecured debt securities by Ameren
    and CILCORP is not subject to approval by any regulatory body.

The Ameren Companies continually evaluate the adequacy and
    appropriateness of their credit arrangements given changing
    business conditions. When business conditions warrant, changes
    may be made to existing credit agreements or other short-term
    borrowing arrangements.

Long-term Debt
    and Equity

The following table presents the issuances of common stock and
    the issuances, redemptions, repurchases and maturities of
    long-term debt and preferred stock (net of any issuance
    discounts and including any redemption premiums) for the years
    2007, 2006 and 2005 for the Ameren Companies and EEI. For
    additional information related to the terms and uses of these
    issuances and the sources of funds and terms for the
    redemptions, see Note 5 – Long-term Debt and

In March 2004, the SEC declared effective a

Form S-3

registration statement filed by Ameren in February 2004,
    authorizing the offering of 6 million additional shares of
    its common stock under DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under
    DRPlus are, at Ameren’s option, newly issued shares,
    treasury shares, or shares purchased in the open market or in
    privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently selling
    newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus.

Ameren is also currently selling newly issued shares of its
    common stock under its 401(k) plan pursuant to an effective SEC

Form S-8

registration statement. Under DRPlus and its 401(k) plan
    (including subsidiary plans that are now merged into the Ameren
    401(k) plan), Ameren issued 1.7 million, ($91 million)
    shares of common stock in 2007, 1.9 million
    ($96 million) in 2006, and 2.1 million
    ($109 million) in 2005.

Ameren, UE and CIPS may sell all or a portion of the remaining
    securities registered under their effective registration
    statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant
    such a sale. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a
    prospectus that meets the requirements of the Securities Act of
    1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Indebtedness
    Provisions and Other Covenants

See Note 4 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity to
    our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for a discussion of the covenants and provisions
    contained in our bank credit facilities and applicable
    cross-default provisions.

Also see Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity
    Financings to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and
    provisions



contained in certain of the Ameren
    Companies’ indenture agreements and articles of
    incorporation.

At December 31, 2007, the Ameren Companies were in
    compliance with their credit facility, indenture, and articles
    of incorporation provisions and covenants.

We consider access to short-term and long-term capital markets a
    significant source of funding for capital requirements not
    satisfied by our operating cash flows. Inability to raise
    capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of
    uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect our
    ability to maintain and expand our businesses. After assessing
    our current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings
    (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that we will continue to
    have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our
    control may create uncertainty in the capital markets or make
    access to the capital markets uncertain or limited. Such events
    would increase our cost of capital or adversely affect our
    ability to access the capital markets.

Dividends

Ameren paid to its shareholders common stock dividends totaling
    $527 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2007,
    $522 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2006, and
    $511 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2005. This resulted in
    a payout rate based on net income of 85% in 2007, 95% in 2006,
    and 84% in 2005. Dividends paid to common shareholders in
    relation to net cash provided by operating activities for the
    same periods were 48% in 2007, 41% in 2006 and 41% in 2005.

The amount and timing of dividends payable on Ameren’s
    common stock are within the sole discretion of Ameren’s
    board of directors. The board of directors has not set specific
    targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock
    dividends. However, the board considers various issues,
    including Ameren’s historical earnings and cash flow,
    projected earnings, projected cash flow and potential cash flow
    requirements, dividend payout rates at other utilities, return
    on investments with similar risk characteristics, impacts of
    regulatory orders or legislation and overall business
    considerations. On February 8, 2008, Ameren’s board of
    directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 63.5
    cents per share payable on March 31, 2008, to shareholders
    of record on March 5, 2008.

Certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational
    documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other
    things, restrict the Ameren Companies’ payment of
    dividends. UE would be restricted as to dividend payments on its
    common and preferred stock if it were to extend or defer
    interest payments on its subordinated debentures. CIPS’
    articles of incorporation require its dividend payments on
    common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total
    capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating
    expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Genco’s
    indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making any
    dividend payments on common stock if debt service coverage
    ratios are below a defined threshold. CILCORP has common and
    preferred stock dividend payment restrictions if leverage ratio
    and interest coverage ratio thresholds are not met, or if
    CILCORP’s senior long-term debt does not have the ratings
    described in its indenture. CILCO has restrictions in its
    articles of incorporation on dividend payments on common stock
    relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the
    annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock and amounts
    to be set aside for any sinking fund retirement of its 5.85%
    Series preferred stock. At December 31, 2007, except as
    described below with respect to the 2007 $500 million
    credit facility and the 2006 $500 million credit facility,
    none of these conditions existed at the Ameren Companies, and as
    a result, they were allowed to pay dividends. The ICC requires
    IP to have a dividend policy comparable to that of Ameren’s
    other Illinois utilities and consistent with achieving and
    maintaining a common equity-to-total-capitalization ratio
    between 50% and 60%.

The 2007 $500 million credit facility and the 2006
    $500 million credit facility limit CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and
    IP to common and preferred stock dividend payments of
    $10 million per year each if CIPS’, CILCO’s or
    IP’s senior secured long-term debt securities or first
    mortgage bonds, or CILCORP’s senior unsecured long-term
    debt securities, have received a below investment-grade credit
    rating from either Moody’s or S&P. With respect to
    AERG, which currently is not rated by Moody’s or S&P,
    the common and preferred stock dividend restriction will not
    apply if its ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated
    operating cash flow, pursuant to a calculation defined in the
    facilities, is less than or equal to 3.0 to 1. On July 26,
    2006, Moody’s downgraded CILCORP’s senior unsecured
    credit rating to below investment-grade, causing it to be
    subject to this dividend payment limitation. As of
    December 31, 2007, AERG was in compliance with the
    debt-to-operating cash flow ratio test in the 2007 and 2006
    $500 million credit facilities and therefore able to pay
    dividends. The other borrowers thereunder are not currently
    limited in their dividend payments by this provision of the 2007
    or 2006 $500 million credit facilities.

The Ameren Companies adopted the provisions of FIN 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” on
    January 1, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the amounts
    of unrecognized tax benefits under the provisions of FIN 48
    were $116 million, $26 million, $- million,
    $40 million, $19 million, $19 million and

$- million for Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and
    IP, respectively. It is reasonably possible to expect that the
    settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit will result in an
    underpayment or overpayment of tax and related interest.
    However, there is a high degree of uncertainty with respect to
    the timing of cash payments or receipts associated with
    unrecognized tax benefits. The amount and timing of certain
    payments is not reliably estimable or determinable at this time.
    See Note 11 – Income Taxes for information
    regarding the Ameren Companies’ unrecognized tax benefits
    and related liabilities for interest expense.

Off-Balance-Sheet
    Arrangements

At December 31, 2007, none of the Ameren Companies had any
    off-balance-sheet financing arrangements other than operating
    leases entered into in the ordinary course of



business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any
    significant off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in the near
    future.

During March and April of 2007, Moody’s, S&P, and
    Fitch downgraded various credit ratings of certain of the Ameren
    Companies. Depending on the specific credit rating agency action
    and the specific legal entities affected, the downgrade of these
    credit ratings was a result of the actions of various Illinois
    state legislators, including consideration of forms of
    legislation that would have rolled back and frozen the electric
    rates of CIPS, CILCO and IP. In the case of UE, this downgrade
    was prompted by higher costs, lower financial metrics, and a
    continued challenging regulatory environment in Missouri.

On June 8, 2007, Fitch changed the rating outlook at UE to
    negative due to the combined effect of the receipt of less than
    expected rate relief and a sizable capital expenditure program.

On August 1, 2007, Fitch changed the rating outlook at
    Ameren to stable. In addition, Fitch revised the rating watch on
    CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP to positive. The positive watch
    followed the announcement of the Illinois electric settlement
    agreement. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory
    Matters to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the
    Illinois electric settlement agreement.

On August 29, 2007, S&P issued a research update in
    response to the Illinois electric settlement agreement. The
    outlook on the ratings of Ameren, UE and Genco was changed to
    stable. The outlook on the ratings of CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, and
    IP was upgraded to positive. On September 6, 2007, S&P
    upgraded its senior secured debt ratings of UE, CIPS, and CILCO
    from “BBB-” to “BBB” as a result of changes
    in its first mortgage bond rating methodology.

On August 29, 2007, Moody’s changed the rating outlook
    at Ameren and Genco to stable. The rating outlook of CIPS,
    CILCORP, CILCO, and IP was upgraded to positive. These actions
    were prompted by the Illinois electric settlement agreement.
    Moody’s stated that “the settlement significantly
    reduces the likelihood of a rate freeze being enacted in
    Illinois and provides the foundation for a potentially improving
    political and regulatory environment for
    investor-owned-utilities in the state.”

On February 12, 2008, Moody’s affirmed the ratings of
    Ameren and Genco but changed their rating outlook to negative
    from stable. Moody’s placed the long-term credit ratings of
    UE under review for possible downgrade and affirmed UE’s
    commercial paper rating. In addition, Moody’s affirmed the
    ratings of CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP and maintained a positive
    rating outlook on these four companies. According to
    Moody’s, the review of UE’s ratings was prompted by
    declining cash flow coverage metrics, increased operating costs,
    higher capital expenditures for environmental compliance and
    transmission and distribution system investment, and significant
    regulatory lag in the recovery of these costs. Moody’s
    stated that the negative outlook on the credit rating of Genco
    reflected Genco’s “position as a predominantly coal
    generating company that is likely to be seriously affected by
    more stringent environmental regulations, including a potential
    cap or tax on carbon emissions.” The negative outlook on
    the ratings of Ameren, according to Moody’s, reflects the
    factors that impacted its subsidiaries, UE and Genco.

Any adverse change in the Ameren Companies’ credit ratings
    may reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral
    postings and prepayments. Such changes may also increase the
    cost of borrowing and fuel, power and gas supply, among other
    things, resulting in a negative impact on earnings. Collateral
    postings and prepayments made as of the end of 2007 were
    $56 million, $5 million, $8 million,
    $14 million, $14 million, and $21 million at
    Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP, respectively, resulting
    from our reduced issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings. At
    December 31, 2007, a reduction to sub-investment-grade
    issuer or senior unsecured debt ratings (lower than
    “BBB-” or “Baa3”), could have resulted in
    Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO or IP being required to
    post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade
    obligations amounting to $176 million, $65 million,
    $13 million, $43 million, $29 million,
    $29 million, and $12 million,



respectively. In addition, the cost of borrowing under our
    credit facilities can increase or decrease depending upon the
    credit ratings of the borrower. A credit rating is not a
    recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. It should be
    evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject
    to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating
    organization. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
    Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk under Part II,
    Item 7A, for information on credit rating changes with
    respect to insured tax-exempt auction-rate bonds.

OUTLOOK

Below are some key trends that may affect the Ameren
    Companies’ financial condition, results of operations, or
    liquidity in 2008 and beyond.

Revenues

•

The earnings of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are largely determined by
    the regulation of their rates by state agencies. With rising
    costs, including fuel and related transportation, purchased
    power, labor, material, depreciation and financing costs coupled
    with increased capital and operations and maintenance
    expenditures targeted at enhanced distribution system
    reliability and environmental compliance, Ameren, UE, CIPS,
    CILCO and IP expect to experience regulatory lag until requests
    to increase rates to recover such costs are granted by state
    regulators. Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP expect to be entering
    a period where more frequent rate cases will be necessary. UE
    expects to file its next electric rate case in Missouri during
    the second quarter of 2008. The Ameren Illinois Utilities filed
    delivery service rate cases with the ICC in November 2007 due to
    inadequate recovery of costs and low returns on equity of less
    than 5% experienced in 2007 and expected in 2008. CIPS, CILCO
    and IP requested to increase their annual revenues for electric
    delivery service by $180 million in the aggregate
    (CIPS – $31 million, CILCO –
    $10 million, and IP – $139 million). The
    electric rate increase requests were based on an 11% return on
    equity, a capital structure composed of 51% to 53% equity, an
    aggregate rate base for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of
    $2.1 billion and a test year ended December 31, 2006,
    with certain prospective updates. In addition, CIPS, CILCO and
    IP filed requests with the ICC in November 2007 to increase
    their annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by
    $67 million in the aggregate (CIPS –
    $15 million increase, CILCO – $4 million
    decrease, and IP – $56 million increase). The
    natural gas rate change requests were based on an 11% return on
    equity, a capital structure composed of 51% to 53% equity, an
    aggregate rate base for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of
    $0.9 billion and a test year ended December 31, 2006,
    with certain prospective updates. The ICC has until the end of
    September 2008 to render a decision in these rate cases.

•

In current and future rate cases, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP will
    also seek cost recovery mechanisms from their state regulators
    to reduce regulatory lag. In their electric and natural gas
    delivery service rate cases filed in November 2007, the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities requested ICC approval to implement rate
    adjustment mechanisms for bad debt expenses, electric
    infrastructure investments, and the decoupling of natural gas
    revenues from sales volumes. In July 2005, a law was enacted
    that enables the MoPSC to put in place fuel and purchased power
    and environmental cost recovery mechanisms for Missouri’s
    utilities. Rules for the fuel and purchased power cost recovery
    mechanism were approved by the MoPSC in September 2006. Rules
    for the environmental cost recovery mechanism were approved by
    the MoPSC in February 2008 and will be effective once published
    in the Missouri Register. UE will not be able to use these cost
    recovery mechanisms until authorized by the MoPSC as part of a
    rate case proceeding. The MoPSC denied UE the use of a fuel and
    purchased power cost recovery mechanism in its 2007 rate order.
    UE plans to request use of a fuel and purchased power cost
    recovery mechanism and, potentially an environmental cost
    recovery mechanism, in its next electric rate case filing.

•

Average residential electric rates for CIPS, CILCO and IP
    increased significantly following the expiration of a rate
    freeze at the end of 2006. Electric rates rose because of the
    increased cost of power purchased on behalf of the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities’ customers and an increase in electric
    delivery service rates. Due to the magnitude of these increases,
    the Illinois electric settlement agreement reached in 2007
    provides approximately $1 billion over a four-year period
    that began in 2007 to fund rate relief for certain electric
    customers in Illinois, including approximately $488 million
    to customers of the Ameren Illinois Utilities. Funding for the
    settlement will come from electric generators in Illinois and
    certain Illinois electric utilities. Pursuant to the Illinois
    electric settlement agreement, the Ameren Illinois Utilities,
    Genco and AERG agreed to fund an aggregate of $150 million,
    of which the following contributions remain to be made as of
    December 31, 2007:

•

As part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, the
    reverse auction used for power procurement in Illinois was
    discontinued. It will be replaced with a new power procurement
    process to be led by the IPA, beginning in 2009. In 2008,
    utilities will contract for necessary power and energy
    requirements primarily through a request-for-proposal process,
    subject to ICC review and



approval. The ICC approved the
    proposed 2008 power procurement plans of the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities in December 2007. Existing supply contracts from the
    September 2006 reverse auction remain in place. The Ameren
    Illinois Utilities’ power procurement costs are passed
    directly to its customers. The impact of the new procurement
    process in Illinois is uncertain.

•

Also as part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities entered into financial contracts with
    Marketing Company (for the benefit of Genco and AERG), to
    lock-in energy prices for 400 to 1,000 megawatts annually of
    their around-the-clock power requirements during the period
    June 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012, at then relevant
    market prices. These financial contracts do not include
    capacity, are not load-following products and do not involve the
    physical delivery of energy.

•

The MoPSC issued an order, as clarified, granting UE a
    $43 million increase in base rates for electric service
    with new electric rates effective June 4, 2007. This order
    included provisions to extend UE’s Callaway nuclear plant
    and fossil generation plant lives and to change the income tax
    method associated with the cost of property removals. Such
    provisions are expected to decrease Ameren’s and UE’s
    expenses by $58 million annually. The MoPSC also approved a
    stipulation and agreement authorizing an increase in UE’s
    annual natural gas delivery revenues of $6 million,
    effective April 1, 2007. UE agreed not to file a natural
    gas delivery rate case before March 15, 2010.

•

Volatile power prices in the Midwest affect the amount of
    revenues Ameren, UE, Genco, CILCO (through AERG) and EEI can
    generate by marketing power into the wholesale and spot markets
    and influence the cost of power purchased in the spot markets.

•

The availability and performance of UE’s, Genco’s,
    AERG’s and EEI’s electric generation fleet can
    materially impact their revenues. Genco and AERG are seeking to
    raise the equivalent availability and capacity factors of their
    power plants over the long-term through greater investments and
    a process improvement program. The Non-rate-regulated Generation
    segment expects to generate 33 million megawatthours of
    power in 2008 (Genco – 18 million,
    AERG – 7 million, EEI –
    8 million), 31 million megawatthours in 2009
    (Genco – 15 million, AERG –
    8 million, EEI – 8 million) and
    33 million megawatthours in 2010 (Genco –
    18 million, AERG – 7 million,
    EEI – 8 million).

•

All but 5 million megawatthours of Genco and AERG’s
    pre-2006 wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements
    expired during 2006. In 2007, 1 million megawatthours of
    these agreements, which had an average embedded selling price of
    $35 per megawatthour, expired. Another 2 million contracted
    megawatthours will expire in late 2008, which have an average
    embedded selling price of $33 per megawatthour. These agreements
    are being replaced with market-based sales.

•

The marketing strategy for Non-rate-regulated Generation is to
    optimize generation output in a low risk manner to minimize
    earnings and cash flow volatility, while capitalizing on its
    low-cost generation fleet to provide solid, sustainable returns.
    Through a mix of physical and financial sales contracts,
    including contracts resulting from the Illinois 2006 power
    procurement auction and the Illinois electric settlement
    agreement, Marketing Company sold as of December 31, 2007,
    approximately 86% of Non-rate-regulated Generation’s
    expected 2008 generation at an average price of $50 per
    megawatthour (fiscal year 2009 – 60%, at an average
    price of $52 per megawatthour; fiscal year 2010 – 45%,
    at an average price of $54 per megawatthour).

•

The future development of ancillary services and capacity
    markets in MISO could increase the electric margins of UE,
    Genco, AERG and EEI. Ancillary services are services necessary
    to support the transmission of energy from generation resources
    to loads while maintaining reliable operation of the
    transmission provider’s system. In February 2008, FERC
    conditionally accepted the ancillary services market tariff
    proposed by MISO. We expect Non-rate-regulated Generation’s
    ancillary services market revenues to increase to
    $15 million in 2008 from $5 million realized in 2007.
    Ancillary services market revenues are allocated to Genco and
    AERG based on their generation in accordance with their power
    supply agreements with Marketing Company.

•

We expect MISO will begin development of a capacity market once
    its ancillary services market is in place. A capacity market
    allows participants to purchase or sell capacity products that
    meet reliability requirements. MISO is currently in the process
    of developing a centralized regional wholesale ancillary
    services market, which is expected to begin during 2008. We
    expect capacity and energy prices to strengthen from current
    levels because of improving market liquidity and decreasing
    reserve margins in MISO. Non-rate-regulated Generation’s
    capacity revenues are expected to increase to approximately
    $40 million in 2008 from $25 million in 2007. EEI
    receives payment for 100% of its capacity sales under its power
    supply agreement with Marketing Company. Capacity revenues are
    allocated to Genco and AERG based on their generation in
    accordance with their power supply agreements with Marketing
    Company.

•

We expect continued economic growth in our service territory and
    market area to benefit energy demand in 2008 and beyond, but
    higher energy prices could result in reduced demand from
    customers, especially in Illinois. Future energy efficiency
    programs developed by UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP and others could
    also result in reduced demand for our electric generation and
    our electric and gas transmission and distribution services.

Fuel and
    Purchased Power

•

In 2007, 84% of Ameren’s electric generation
    (UE – 76%, Genco – 96%, AERG –
    99%, EEI – 100%) was supplied by coal-fired power
    plants. About 94% of the coal used by these plants
    (UE – 97%, Genco – 88%,



AERG – 92%, EEI – 100%) was delivered by
    railroads from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. In the past,
    deliveries from the Powder River Basin have been restricted
    because of rail maintenance, weather, and derailments. As of
    December 31, 2007, coal inventories for UE, Genco, AERG and
    EEI were adequate, and in excess of historical levels, but below
    targeted levels. Disruptions in coal deliveries could cause UE,
    Genco, AERG and EEI to pursue a strategy that could include
    reducing sales of power during low-margin periods, buying
    higher-cost fuels to generate required electricity, and
    purchasing power from other sources.

•

Ameren’s fuel costs (including transportation) are expected
    to increase in 2008 and beyond. Fuel costs for both Missouri
    Regulated and Non-rate-regulated Generation are expected to
    increase approximately 35% from 2007 to 2010. As of
    December 31, 2007, approximately 94%, 86% and 54% of
    Missouri Regulated’s estimated fuel costs for 2008, 2009
    and 2010, respectively, were priced-hedged. Approximately 98%,
    72% and 16% of Non-rate-regulated Generation’s estimated
    fuel costs for 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, were
    price-hedged. See Item 7A – Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this report for
    additional information about the percentage of fuel and
    transportation requirements that are price-hedged for 2008
    through 2012.

Other
    Costs

•

In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at
    UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility. This
    resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which
    damaged a state park. In January 2008, the Circuit Court of
    Reynolds County, Missouri, approved UE’s November 2007
    settlement agreement with the state of Missouri resolving the
    state’s lawsuit and claims for damages and other relief
    related to the breach. In addition, pursuant to the settlement
    agreement, UE is required to replace the breached upper
    reservoir with a new reservoir, subject to FERC authorization.
    UE received approval from FERC to rebuild the upper reservoir in
    August 2007 and hired a contractor in November 2007. The
    estimated cost to rebuild the upper reservoir is in the range of
    $450 million. UE expects the Taum Sauk pumped-storage
    hydroelectric facility to be out of service through at least the
    fall of 2009, if not longer. UE believes that substantially all
    of the damages and liabilities caused by the breach, including
    costs related to the settlement agreement with the state of
    Missouri, the cost of rebuilding the plant, and the cost of
    replacement power, up to $8 million annually, will be
    covered by insurance. Insurance will not cover lost electric
    margins and penalties paid to FERC. Under UE’s insurance
    policies, all claims by or against UE are subject to review by
    its insurance carriers. As a result of this breach, UE is
    engaged in litigation initiated by certain private parties. We
    are unable to predict the timing, or outcomes of this
    litigation, or its possible effect on UE’s results of
    operation, financial position or liquidity. See
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and
    Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report
    for a further discussion of Taum Sauk matters.

•

UE’s Callaway nuclear plant’s next scheduled refueling
    and maintenance outage in the fall of 2008 is expected to last
    25 to 30 days. During a scheduled outage, which occurs
    every 18 months, maintenance and purchased power costs
    increase, and the amount of excess power available for sale
    decreases, versus non-outage years.

•

Over the next few years, we expect rising employee benefit costs
    as well as higher insurance and security costs associated with
    additional measures we have taken, or may need to take, at
    UE’s Callaway nuclear plant and at our other facilities.
    Insurance premiums may also increase as a result of the Taum
    Sauk incident, among other things.

•

Bad debts may increase due to rising electric and gas rates.

•

As we refinance our short-term and variable-rate debt into
    fixed-rate debt, financing costs may increase.

•

We are currently undertaking cost reduction and control
    initiatives associated with the strategic sourcing of purchases
    and streamlining of all aspects of our business.

Capital
    Expenditures

•

The EPA has issued more stringent emission limits on all
    coal-fired power plants. Between 2008 and 2017, Ameren expects
    that certain Ameren Companies will be required to invest between
    $4 billion and $5 billion to retrofit their power
    plants with pollution control equipment. Costs for these types
    of projects continue to escalate. These investments will also
    result in decreased plant availability during construction and
    significantly higher ongoing operating expenses. Approximately
    45% of this investment will be in Ameren’s regulated UE
    operations, and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from
    ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts expended in
    non-rate-regulated operations will depend on whether market
    prices for power adjust as a result of market conditions
    reflecting increased environmental costs for generators.

•

Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate
    limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in
    significant increases in capital expenditures and operating
    costs. Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or
    regulations might force Ameren and other similarly-situated
    electric power generators to close some coal-fired facilities.
    In December 2007, Ameren issued a report on how it is responding
    to the rising regulatory, competitive, and public pressure to
    significantly reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions from
    current and proposed power plant operations. The report included
    Ameren’s climate change strategy and activities, current
    greenhouse gas emissions, and analysis with respect to plausible
    future greenhouse gas scenarios; it is available on
    Ameren’s



Web site. Investments to control carbon emissions at
    Ameren’s coal-fired plants would significantly increase
    future capital expenditures and operation and maintenance
    expenses.

•

UE continues to evaluate its longer-term needs for new baseload
    and peaking electric generation capacity. At this time, UE does
    not expect to require new baseload generation capacity until
    2018 to 2020. However, due to the significant time required to
    plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload power plant, UE
    is actively studying future plant alternatives, including those
    that would use coal or nuclear fuel. In 2007, UE signed an
    agreement with UniStar Nuclear to assist UE in the preparation
    of a combined construction and operating license application
    (COLA) for filing with the NRC. A COLA describes how a nuclear
    plant would be designed, constructed and operated. In addition,
    UE has also signed contracts for certain long lead-time
    equipment. Preparing that COLA and entering into these contracts
    does not mean a decision has been made to build a nuclear plant.
    These are only the first steps in the regulatory licensing and
    procurement process. UE and UniStar Nuclear must submit the COLA
    to the NRC in 2008 to be eligible for incentives available under
    provisions of the 2005 Energy Policy Act. We cannot predict
    whether or when the NRC will approve the COLA.

•

UE intends to submit a license extension application with the
    NRC to extend its Callaway nuclear plant’s operating
    license by twenty years so that the operating license will
    expire in 2044. UE cannot predict whether or when the NRC will
    approve the license extension.

•

Over the next few years, we expect to make significant
    investments in our electric and gas infrastructure and to incur
    increased operations and maintenance expenses to improve overall
    system reliability. We are projecting higher labor and material
    costs for these capital expenditures. UE announced in July 2007
    plans to spend $300 million over three years for
    underground cabling and reliability improvement,
    $135 million ($45 million per year) for tree-trimming,
    and $84 million over three years (approximately
    $28 million per year) for circuit and device inspection and
    repair. We would expect these costs or investments to be
    ultimately recovered in rates.

•

Increased investments for environmental compliance, reliability
    improvement, and new baseload capacity will result in higher
    depreciation and financing costs.

•

The Ameren Companies will incur significant capital expenditures
    over the next five years for compliance with environmental
    regulations and to make significant investments in their
    electric and gas utility infrastructure to improve overall
    system reliability. Expenditures are expected to be funded
    primarily with debt.

•

As required by the MoPSC, UE filed a study in November 2007 with
    the MoPSC evaluating the costs and benefits of UE’s
    participation in MISO. This case is currently pending. UE’s
    filing noted that there were a number of uncertainties
    associated with the cost-benefit study, including issues
    associated with the UE-MISO service agreement. If some of these
    uncertainties are ultimately resolved in a manner adverse to UE,
    it could call into question whether it is cost-effective for UE
    to remain in MISO. UE has advised MISO of its intent to withdraw
    from MISO as of December 31, 2008, in order to preserve the
    option to withdraw based on the outcome of the pending MoPSC
    proceeding. It is uncertain when or how the MoPSC will rule on
    UE’s MISO cost-benefit study or, if UE were to withdraw
    from MISO, what the effect of such a withdrawal would be
    on UE.

The above items could have a material impact on our results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity. Additionally, in
    the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to
    enhance our results of operations, financial position, or
    liquidity. These strategies may include acquisitions,
    divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase
    revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase
    Ameren’s shareholder value. We are unable to predict which,
    if any, of these initiatives will be executed. The execution of
    these initiatives may have a material impact on our future
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

REGULATORY
    MATTERS

See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report.

ACCOUNTING
    MATTERS

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures
    in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate
    technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of
    estimates. Our application of these policies involves judgments
    regarding many factors which in and of themselves could
    materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. We
    have outlined below the critical accounting policies that we
    believe are most difficult, subjective or complex. Any change in



the assumptions or judgments
    applied in determining the following matters, among others,
    could have a material impact on future financial results.

Accounting Estimate

Uncertainties Affecting
    Application

Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery

All of the Ameren Companies, except Genco, defer costs as
    regulatory assets in accordance with SFAS No. 71,
    “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
    Regulation,” and make investments that they assume will be
    collected in future rates.

•     Regulatory environment and external regulatory decisions and requirements

•     Anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact

•     Impact of deregulation, rate freezes, and competition on ratemaking process and ability to recover costs

Basis for Judgment

We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous
    rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where
    we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost
    recovery is probable. If facts and circumstances lead us to
    conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is probably no longer
    recoverable, we record a charge to earnings, which could be
    material. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory
    Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of
    this report for quantification of these assets by registrant.

Environmental Costs

We accrue for all known environmental

contamination where remediation can be reasonably estimated, but
    some of our operations have existed for over 100 years and
    previous contamination may be unknown to us.

•     Extent of contamination

•     Responsible party determination

•     Approved methods for cleanup

•     Present and future legislation and governmental regulations and standards

•     Results of ongoing research and development regarding environmental impacts

Basis for Judgment

We determine the proper amounts to accrue for known
    environmental contamination by using estimates of cleanup costs
    in the context of current remediation standards and available
    technology. See Note 13 – Commitments and
    Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8,
    of this report for disclosure on quantified environmental costs,
    to the extent possible.

Unbilled Revenue

At the end of each period, we project expected usage, and we
    estimate the amount of revenue to record for services that have
    been billed.

•     Projecting customer energy usage

•     Estimating impacts of weather and other usage-affecting factors provided to customers but not yet for the unbilled period

•     Estimating loss of energy during transmission and delivery

Basis for Judgment

We base our estimate of unbilled revenue each period on the
    volume of energy delivered, as valued by a model of billing
    cycles and historical usage rates and growth by customer class
    for our service area. This figure is then adjusted for the
    modeled impact of seasonal and weather variations based on
    historical results. See balance sheets under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for unbilled revenue amounts for
    each registrant.

Valuation of Goodwill, Long-Lived Assets, and Asset
    Retirement Obligations

We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and long-lived
    assets to determine whether they are impaired. We also review
    for the existence of asset retirement obligations. If an asset
    retirement obligation is identified, we determine its fair value
    and subsequently reassess and adjust the obligation, as
    necessary.

•     Management’s identification of impairment indicators

•     Changes in business, industry, laws, technology, or economic and market conditions.

•     Valuation assumptions and conclusions

•     Estimated useful lives of our significant long-lived assets

•     Actions or assessments by our regulators

•     Identification of an asset retirement obligation



Accounting Estimate

Uncertainties Affecting
    Application

Basis for Judgment

Annually, or whenever events indicate a valuation may have
    changed, we use various valuation methodologies to determine
    valuations, including earnings before interest, taxes,
    depreciation and amortization multiples, and discounted,
    undiscounted, and probabilistic discounted cash flow models with
    multiple scenarios. The identification of asset retirement
    obligations is conducted through the review of legal documents
    and interviews. See Note 1  – Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements
    under Part II, Item 8, of this report for
    quantification of our goodwill assets.

Benefit Plan Accounting

Based on actuarial calculations, we accrue costs of providing
    future employee benefits in accordance with
    SFAS Nos. 87, 106, 112 and 158, which provide guidance
    on benefit plan accounting. See Note 9 –
    Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under
    Part II, Item 8, of this report.

•     Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets

•     Interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations

•     Health care cost trend rates

•     Timing of employee retirements and mortality assumptions

•     Ability to recover certain benefit plan costs from our rate payers

Basis for Judgment

Our ultimate selection of the discount rate, health care trend
    rate, and expected rate of return on pension assets is based on
    our review of available historical, current, and projected
    rates, as applicable. See Note 9 – Retirement
    Benefits to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for sensitivity of Ameren’s
    benefit plans to potential changes in these assumptions.

Impact of Future
    Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report.

EFFECTS OF
    INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

Our rates for retail electric and gas utility service are
    regulated by the MoPSC and the ICC. Nonretail electric rates are
    regulated by FERC. Adjustments to rates are based on a
    regulatory process that reviews a historical period. As a
    result, revenue increases will lag behind changing prices.
    Inflation affects our operations, earnings, stockholders’
    equity, and financial performance.

The current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially
    exceeds our recorded historical cost. Under existing regulatory
    practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from
    customers. As a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery
    of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate
    to replace the plant in future years. Our Non-rate-regulated
    Generation businesses do not have regulated recovery mechanisms.

In UE’s Missouri electric utility jurisdiction, there is
    currently no tariff for adjusting rates to accommodate changes
    in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of
    purchased power. However, in July 2005, a law was enacted that
    enables the MoPSC to put in place cost recovery mechanisms for
    fuel and purchased power and for environmental costs at
    Missouri’s utilities. Rules for the fuel and purchased
    power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the MoPSC in
    September 2006. Rules for the environmental cost recovery
    mechanism were approved by the MoPSC in February 2008 and will
    be effective once published in the Missouri Register. UE will
    not be able to use these cost recovery mechanisms until so
    authorized by the MoPSC as part of a rate case proceeding. In
    its rate case filed in July 2006, UE was denied use of a fuel
    and purchased power cost recovery mechanism. UE plans to request
    use of a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism, and
    potentially an environmental cost recovery mechanism, in its
    next electric rate case filing.

Effective January 2, 2007, ICC-approved tariffs in Illinois
    allow CIPS, CILCO and IP to recover power supply costs by
    adjusting rates to accommodate changes in power prices. See
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this
    report for information on the Illinois electric rate settlement
    agreement that addressed legislative and other efforts to limit
    full recovery of power costs in Illinois.

In our Missouri and Illinois retail gas utility jurisdictions,
    changes in gas costs are generally reflected in



billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. As part of a
    stipulation and agreement, effective April 1, 2007, UE has
    agreed not to file a natural gas delivery rate case before
    March 15, 2010. This agreement did not prevent UE from
    filing to recover gas infrastructure replacement costs through
    an ISRS during this three-year rate moratorium. In February
    2008, the MoPSC approved UE’s petition requesting the
    establishment of an ISRS, to recover annual revenues of
    $1 million effective March 29, 2008.

UE, Genco, CILCORP and AERG are affected by changes in
    market prices for natural gas to the extent that they must
    purchase natural gas to run CTs. These companies have structured
    various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas
    pools and supply basins, and to minimize the impact to their
    financial statements. See Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures about Market Risk – Commodity Price Risk
    under Part II, Item 7A, below for further information.
    Also see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to
    our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for further information on the cost recovery
    mechanisms discussed above, as well as rate-related recovery
    mechanisms being sought by the Ameren Illinois Utilities in
    their pending rate cases with the ICC.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset
    or a financial instrument, derivative or nonderivative, caused
    by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates,
    commodity prices, and equity security prices. A derivative is a
    contract whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value
    of some underlying asset. The following discussion of our risk
    management activities includes forward-looking statements that
    involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ
    materially from those projected in the forward-looking
    statements. We handle market risks in accordance with
    established policies, which may include entering into various
    derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we
    also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable.
    Such risks, principally business, legal and operational risks,
    are not part of the following discussion.

Our risk management objective is to optimize our physical
    generating assets and to pursue market opportunities within
    prudent risk parameters. Our risk management policies are set by
    a risk management steering committee, which is composed of
    senior-level Ameren officers.

Interest Rate
    Risk

We are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates
    associated with:

•

long-term and short-term variable-rate debt;

•

fixed-rate debt;

•

commercial paper; and

•

auction-rate long-term debt.

We manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount
    of these instruments we have within our total capitalization
    portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in
    interest rates.

The following table presents the estimated increase in our
    annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest
    rates were to increase by 1% on variable-rate debt outstanding
    at December 31, 2007:

The estimated changes above do not consider potential reduced
    overall economic activity that would exist in such an
    environment. In the event of a significant change in interest
    rates, management would probably act to further mitigate our
    exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of
    the specific actions that would be taken and their possible
    effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our
    financial structure.

Insured
    Tax-exempt Auction Rate Bonds

Our tax-exempt environmental improvement and pollution control
    revenue-auction-rate bonds issued for the benefit of UE, CIPS,
    CILCO and IP through governmental authorities are insured by
    “monoline” bond insurers. See Note 5 –
    Long-term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements
    under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a
    description and details of the tax-exempt environmental
    improvement and pollution control revenue bonds issued for the
    benefit of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. Monoline bond insurers
    guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest
    when an issuer defaults; as a result, such securities typically
    receive the highest investment-grade ratings from the credit
    rating agencies, which reflect the credit ratings of the
    monoline bond insurers. UE has an aggregate of $437 million
    principal amount of insured tax-exempt auction-rate bonds
    ($229 million insured by XL Capital Ltd., $208 million
    insured by MBIA Inc.). CIPS has $35 million principal
    amount of insured tax-exempt auction-



rate bonds insured by XL Capital Ltd. CILCO has $19 million
    principal amount of insured tax-exempt auction-rate bonds
    insured by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company. IP has an
    aggregate of $337 million principal amount of insured
    tax-exempt auction-rate bonds ($150 million insured by MBIA
    Inc., $187 million insured by Ambac Financial Group, Inc.).
    Our insured tax-exempt auction-rate bonds bear interest at rates
    determined pursuant to auctions conducted every seven or
    35 days, depending on the particular series of securities.
    As a result of developments in the capital markets with respect
    to residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized
    debt obligations, the credit rating agencies have placed some of
    the monoline bond insurers on review for a possible downgrade or
    have actually downgraded their credit ratings due to their
    insuring of such securities. As a result, since December 2007,
    the insured tax-exempt bonds that are guaranteed by the monoline
    bond insurers have similarly been placed on review for possible
    downgrade or have been downgraded. A credit rating is not a
    recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. It should be
    evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject
    to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.

As a result of these actions by the credit rating agencies with
    respect to monoline bond insurers and a lack of liquidity in the
    auction rate market, we believe the interest rates on certain of
    our insured tax-exempt auction rate bonds are higher than they
    would have been in the absence of such actions. It is possible
    that the credit rating agencies may continue to take steps to
    further downgrade the credit ratings of the monoline bond
    insurers as well as our tax-exempt bonds insured by such
    insurers and any such further negative actions could result in
    higher interest rates on our insured tax-exempt auction rate
    bonds. Downgrades of the monoline bond insurers also increase
    the possibility of a “failed auction,” where there are
    not sufficient clearing bids in an auction to set the interest
    rate. A “failed auction” would result in the interest
    rates resetting to maximum interest rates ranging up to 18%,
    depending upon the series of bonds, until the next scheduled
    auction date at which time another attempt at a successful
    auction will be made.

Between February 12 and 20, we experienced “failed
    auctions” with respect to a portion of our tax-exempt
    auction rate bonds. According to press reports, many other
    series of tax-exempt auction rate securities similarly
    experienced “failed auctions.”

We are evaluating various options available to us, including
    refinancing with other instruments, to mitigate the effects of
    the ratings downgrades on the monoline insurers and the effects
    of these on the interest rates of our securities. Certain of
    these options would require approvals from state regulators and
    could result in higher expense.

Credit
    Risk

Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if
    counterparties fail to perform as contracted. NYMEX-traded
    futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit
    quality of the clearing members of the NYMEX and have nominal
    credit risk. In all other transactions, we are exposed to credit
    risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the
    transaction.

Our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit
    risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and executory
    contracts with market risk exposures. The risk associated with
    trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers
    in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer
    base. At December 31, 2007, no nonaffiliated customer
    represented more than 10%, in the aggregate, of our accounts
    receivable. Our revenues are primarily derived from sales of
    electricity and natural gas to customers in Missouri and
    Illinois. UE, CIPS, Genco, AERG, IP, AFS, and Marketing Company
    may have credit exposure associated with interchange or
    wholesale purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated
    companies. At December 31, 2007, UE’s, CIPS’,
    Genco’s, CILCO’s, IP’s, AFS’, and Marketing
    Company’s combined credit exposure to nonaffiliated
    non-investment-grade trading counterparties related to
    interchange or wholesale purchases and sales was less than
    $1 million, net of collateral (2006 – less than
    $1 million). We establish credit limits for these
    counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits
    on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program
    that involves daily exposure reporting to senior management,
    master trading and netting agreements, and credit support, such
    as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also analyze
    each counterparty’s financial condition before we enter
    into sales, forwards, swaps, futures or option contracts, and we
    monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged
    leases. We estimate our credit exposure to MISO associated with
    the MISO Day Two Energy Market to be $63 million at
    December 31, 2007 (2006 – $35 million).

The Ameren Illinois Utilities will be exposed to credit risk in
    the event of nonperformance by the parties contributing to the
    Illinois comprehensive rate relief and assistance programs under
    the Illinois electric settlement agreement, which will provide
    $488 million in rate relief over a four-year period to
    certain electric customers of the Ameren Illinois Utilities.
    Under funding agreements among the parties contributing to the
    rate relief and assistance programs, at the end of each month,
    the Ameren Illinois Utilities bill the participating generators
    for their proportionate share of that month’s rate relief
    and assistance, which is due in 30 days, or drawn from the
    funds provided by the generators’ escrow. See
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters to our
    financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this
    report for additional information.

Equity Price
    Risk

Our costs of providing defined benefit retirement and
    postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of
    factors, including the rate of return on plan assets. Ameren
    manages plan assets in accordance with the “prudent
    investor” guidelines contained in ERISA. Ameren’s goal
    is to earn the highest possible return on plan assets consistent
    with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates investment
    management to specialists in each asset class.



Where appropriate, Ameren provides the investment manager with
    guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment
    types. Ameren regularly monitors manager performance and
    compliance with investment guidelines.

The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and
    projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes
    in the investment portfolio. Assumed projected rates of return
    for each asset class were selected after an analysis of
    historical experience, future expectations, and the volatility
    of the various asset classes. After considering the target asset
    allocation for each asset class, we adjusted the overall
    expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and
    expected experience of active portfolio management results
    compared with benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses
    paid from plan assets.

In future years, the costs of such plans reflected in net income
    or OCI and cash contributions to the plans could increase
    materially, without pension asset portfolio investment returns
    equal to or in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of
    8.25%.

UE also maintains a trust fund, as required by the NRC and
    Missouri law, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant
    decommissioning. As of December 31, 2007, this fund was
    invested primarily in domestic equity securities (63%) and debt
    securities (36%) and totaled $307 million (in
    2006 – $285 million). By maintaining a portfolio
    that includes long-term equity investments, UE seeks to maximize
    the returns to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs
    within acceptable parameters of risk. However, the equity
    securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price
    fluctuations in equity markets. The fixed-rate, fixed-income
    securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. UE actively
    monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its
    investments against certain indices and by maintaining and
    periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages
    of the assets of the trust to various investment options.
    UE’s exposure to equity price market risk is in large part
    mitigated, because UE is currently allowed to recover through
    electric rates its decommissioning costs, which would include
    unfavorable investment results.

Commodity Price
    Risk

We are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity,
    fuel, and natural gas. UE’s, Genco’s, AERG’s and
    EEI’s risks of changes in prices for power sales are
    partially hedged through sales agreements. Genco, AERG and EEI
    also seek to sell power forward to wholesale, municipal and
    industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices. We
    also attempt to mitigate financial risks through structured risk
    management programs and policies, which include structured
    forward-hedging programs, and the use of derivative financial
    instruments (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts,
    option contracts, and financial swap contracts). However, a
    portion of the generation capacity of UE, Genco, AERG and EEI is
    not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements
    and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices.

The following table shows how our earnings might decrease if
    power prices were to decrease by 1% on unhedged economic
    generation for 2008 through 2012:

Ameren also uses its portfolio management and trading
    capabilities both to manage risk and to deploy risk capital to
    generate additional returns. Due to our physical presence in the
    market, we are able to identify and pursue opportunities which
    can generate additional returns through portfolio management and
    trading activities. All of this activity is performed within a
    controlled risk management process. We establish value at
    risk (VaR) and stop-loss limits that are intended to prevent any
    negative material financial impact.

Similar techniques are used to manage risks associated with
    changing prices of fuel for generation. Most UE, Genco and AERG
    fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts. UE, Genco
    and AERG do not have a provision similar to the PGA clause for
    electric operations, so UE, Genco and AERG have entered into
    long-term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal and
    nuclear fuel to manage their exposure to fuel prices. The coal
    hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply
    while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility. Price and
    volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through
    periodic bid procedures, whereby the amount of coal purchased is
    determined by the current market prices and the minimum and
    maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year. We
    generally purchase coal up to five years in advance, but we may
    purchase coal beyond five years to take advantage of favorable
    deals or market conditions. The strategy also allows for the
    decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market
    conditions.

Transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a
    significant portion of fuel costs. We typically hedge coal
    transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to
    mitigate transportation price volatility. Natural gas
    transportation expenses for Ameren’s gas distribution
    utility companies and the gas-fired generation units of UE,
    Genco, AERG and EEI are regulated by FERC through approved
    tariffs governing the rates, terms and conditions of
    transportation and storage services. Certain firm transportation
    and storage capacity agreements held by Ameren Companies include
    rights to extend the contracts prior to the termination of the
    primary term. Depending on our competitive position, we are able
    in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariff rates
    for our requirements.



The following table presents the percentages of the projected
    required supply of coal and coal transportation for our
    coal-fired power plants, nuclear fuel for UE’s Callaway
    nuclear plant, natural gas for our CTs and retail distribution,
    as appropriate, and purchased power needs of CIPS, CILCO and IP,
    which own no generation, that are price-hedged over the
    five-year period 2008 through 2012, as of December 31, 2007:

    purchased power for fixed-price large commercial and industrial
    customers with 1 megawatt of demand or higher. Nearly all of
    these customers chose a third-party supplier. Also excluded from
    the percent hedged amount is purchased power to serve
    large-service real-time pricing customers, which is purchased as
    needed. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters
    and Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to
    our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for a discussion of this matter and the new power
    procurement process pursuant to the Illinois electric settlement
    agreement.



The following table shows how our total fuel expense might
    increase and how our net income might decrease if coal and coal
    transportation costs were to increase by 1% on any requirements
    not currently covered by fixed-price contracts for the five-year
    period 2008 through 2012. In addition, coal and coal
    transportation costs are sensitive to the price of diesel fuel
    as a result of rail freight fuel surcharges. If diesel fuel
    costs were to increase by

$0.25/gallon,

Ameren’s fuel expense could increase by $13 million
    annually (UE – $7 million, Genco –
    $3 million, AERG – $1 million and
    EEI – $2 million). As of December 31, 2007,
    Ameren has price-hedged approximately 75% of expected fuel
    surcharges in 2008.

In the event of a significant change in coal prices, UE, Genco
    and CILCO would probably take actions to further mitigate their
    exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of
    the specific actions that would be taken and their possible
    effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our
    financial structure or fuel sources.

With regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear
    fuel, UE has fixed-priced and base-price-with- escalation
    agreements, or it uses inventories that provide some price hedge
    to fulfill its Callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium,
    conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services through 2008.
    There is no fuel reloading scheduled for 2009. UE has price
    hedges for 87% of the 2010 to 2012 nuclear fuel requirements.

The nuclear fuel markets have undergone significant change. What
    was once a buyer’s market has become a seller’s
    market; with increased potential for supply disruptions. UE has
    increased its desired inventories of nuclear fuel (with inherent
    price hedge) and has increased its forward contract coverage.
    New long-term uranium contracts are almost exclusively
    market-price-related with an escalating price floor. New
    long-term enrichment contracts usually have some
    market-price-related component. Therefore, nuclear fuel price
    increases are expected, and price hedging becomes less
    available. UE expects to enter into additional contracts from
    time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected
    life of the Callaway nuclear plant, at prices which cannot now
    be accurately predicted. Unlike the electricity and natural gas
    markets, nuclear fuel markets have no sophisticated financial
    instruments available for price hedging, so most hedging is done
    through inventories and forward contracts, if they are available.

With regard to the electric generating operations for UE, Genco
    and AERG that are exposed to changes in market prices for
    natural gas used to run CTs, the natural gas procurement
    strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery
    of natural gas while minimizing costs. We optimize
    transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring
    supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and
    supply basins.

Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO
    and IP have been granted FTRs associated with the advent of the
    MISO Day Two Energy Market. Marketing Company has acquired FTRs
    for its participation in the PJM-Northern Illinois market. The
    FTRs are intended to mitigate expected electric transmission
    congestion charges related to our physical electricity business.
    Depending on the congestion and prices at various points on the
    electric transmission grid, FTRs could result in either charges
    or credits. We use complex grid modeling tools to determine
    which FTRs we wish to nominate in the FTR allocation process.
    There is a risk that we may incorrectly model the amount of FTRs
    we will need, and there is the potential that the FTRs could be
    ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges.

With regard to UE’s natural gas distribution business and
    CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s power and natural gas
    distribution businesses, exposure to changing market prices is
    in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery
    mechanisms in place. These cost recovery mechanisms allow UE,
    CIPS, CILCO and IP to pass on to retail customers prudently
    incurred costs. Our strategy is designed to reduce the effect of
    market fluctuations for our regulated customers. We cannot
    eliminate the effects of price volatility. However, procurement
    strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments
    similar to those outlined earlier, as well as the management of
    physical assets.

With regard to our exposure for commodity price risk for
    construction and maintenance activities, Ameren is exposed to
    changes in market prices for metal commodities and labor
    availability.

See Supply for Electric Power under Part I, Item 1, of
    this report for the percentages of our historical needs
    satisfied by coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric and oil.
    Also see Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies
    to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for further information.

Fair Value of
    Contracts

Most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal
    purchases and normal sales. We use derivatives principally to
    manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas,
    fuel, electricity and emission allowances.

Price fluctuations in natural gas, fuel, electricity and
    emission allowances may cause any of these conditions:

•

an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted
    commitments to purchase or sell when



purchase or sales prices under the commitments are compared with
    current commodity prices;

•

market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased
    power that differ from the cost of those commodities in
    inventory under contracted commitment; or

•

actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that
    differ from anticipated cash outlays.

The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by
    our risk management policies for forward contracts, futures,
    options and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed
    within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new
    or offsetting transactions are required. The goal of the hedging
    program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring
    that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements.
    See Note 7 – Derivative Financial Instruments to
    our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of
    this report for further information.

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Ameren Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Ameren
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and
    2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control – Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain tax positions as of January 1, 2007, and the
    manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and
    postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
    financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
    Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects,
    the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
    the related financial statements. These financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
    statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
    used and significant estimates made by management, and
    evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.



As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain tax positions as of January 1, 2007, and the
    manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and
    postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2006.

NOTE 1 –
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public
    utility holding company under PUHCA 2005, administered by FERC.
    Ameren’s primary assets are the common stock of its
    subsidiaries. Ameren’s subsidiaries are separate,
    independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets and
    liabilities. These subsidiaries operate rate-regulated electric
    generation, transmission and distribution businesses,
    rate-regulated natural gas transmission and distribution
    businesses, and non-rate-regulated electric generation
    businesses in Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Ameren’s
    common stock depend on distributions made to it by its
    subsidiaries. Ameren’s principal subsidiaries are listed
    below. Also see the Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations at the
    front of this report.

•

UE, or Union Electric Company, also known as AmerenUE,
    operates a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission and
    distribution business, and a rate-regulated natural gas
    transmission and distribution business in Missouri. Before
    May 2, 2005, it also operated those businesses in Illinois.
    UE was incorporated in Missouri in 1922 and is successor to a
    number of companies, the oldest of which was organized in 1881.
    It is the largest electric utility in the state of Missouri. It
    supplies electric and gas service to a 24,000-square-mile area
    located in central and eastern Missouri. This area has an
    estimated population of 3 million and includes the Greater
    St. Louis area. UE supplies electric service to
    1.2 million customers and natural gas service to 127,000
    customers.

•

CIPS, or Central Illinois Public Service Company, also known as
    AmerenCIPS, operates a rate-regulated electric and natural gas
    transmission and distribution business in Illinois. CIPS was
    incorporated in Illinois in 1902. It supplies electric and gas
    utility service to portions of central, west central and
    southern Illinois having an estimated population of
    1 million in an area of 20,500 square miles. CIPS
    supplies electric service to 400,000 customers and natural gas
    service to 190,000 customers.

•

Genco, or Ameren Energy Generating Company, operates a
    non-rate-regulated electric generation business in Illinois and
    Missouri. Genco was incorporated in Illinois in March 2000.
    Genco owns 2,549  megawatts of coal-fired electric
    generating capacity and 1,666 megawatts of natural gas and
    oil-fired electric generating capacity.

•

CILCO, or Central Illinois Light Company, also known as
    AmerenCILCO, is a subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company). It
    operates a rate-regulated electric transmission and distribution
    business, a non-rate-regulated electric generation business, and
    a rate-regulated natural gas transmission and distribution
    business in Illinois. CILCO was incorporated in Illinois in
    1913. It supplies electric and gas utility service to portions
    of central and east central Illinois in areas of 3,700 and
    4,500 square miles, respectively, with a population of
    1 million. CILCO supplies electric service to 210,000
    customers and natural gas service to 213,000 customers. AERG, a
    non-rate-regulated wholly owned subsidiary of CILCO, owns 1,074
    megawatts of coal-fired electric generating capacity and 55
    megawatts of natural gas and oil-fired electric generating
    capacity. CILCORP was incorporated in Illinois in 1985.

•

IP, or Illinois Power Company, also known as AmerenIP,
    operates a rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission
    and distribution business in Illinois. IP was incorporated in
    1923 in Illinois. It supplies electric and gas utility service
    to portions of central, east central and southern Illinois,
    serving a population of 1.4 million in an area of
    15,000 square miles, contiguous to our other service
    territories. IP supplies electric service to 626,000 customers
    and natural gas service to 427,000 customers, including most of
    the Illinois portion of the Greater St. Louis area.

Ameren has various other subsidiaries responsible for the short-
    and long-term marketing of power, procurement of fuel,
    management of commodity risks, and provision of other shared
    services. Ameren has an 80% ownership interest in EEI, which
    during 2007 was held 40% by UE and 40% by Development Company.
    Ameren consolidates EEI for financial reporting purposes, while
    UE for 2007 reported EEI under the equity method. Effective
    February 29, 2008, UE’s and Development Company’s
    ownership interests in EEI were transferred to Resources Company
    through an internal reorganization. UE’s interest in EEI
    was transferred at book value indirectly through a dividend to
    Ameren.

The following table presents summarized financial information of
    EEI (in millions).

The financial statements of the Ameren Companies (except CIPS)
    are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the
    accounts of their majority-owned subsidiaries as applicable. All
    significant intercompany



transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts
    are in millions, unless otherwise indicated.

Our accounting policies conform to GAAP. Our financial
    statements reflect all adjustments (which include normal,
    recurring adjustments) that are necessary, in our opinion, for a
    fair presentation of our results. The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and
    assumptions affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates
    of financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

Regulation

Certain Ameren subsidiaries are regulated by the MoPSC, the ICC,
    the NRC, and FERC. In accordance with SFAS No. 71,
    “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
    Regulation,” UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP defer certain costs
    pursuant to actions of our rate regulators. These companies are
    currently recovering such costs in rates charged to customers.
    See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters for
    further information.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and temporary
    investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
    or less.

Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts Receivable

The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the
    amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts
    receivable. The allowance is based on the application of a
    historical write-off factor to the amount of outstanding
    receivables, including unbilled revenue, and a review for
    collectibility of certain accounts over 90 days past due.

Materials and
    Supplies

Materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost or
    market. Cost is determined using the average-cost method.
    Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then
    expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
    installed. The following table presents a breakdown of materials
    and supplies for each of the Ameren Companies at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006:

    propane, and tire chips.

Property and
    Plant

We capitalize the cost of additions to and betterments of units
    of property and plant. The cost includes labor, material,
    applicable taxes, and overhead. An allowance for funds used
    during construction, or the cost of borrowed funds and the cost
    of equity funds (preferred and common stockholders’ equity)
    applicable to rate-regulated construction expenditures, is also
    added for our rate-regulated assets. Interest during
    construction is added for non-rate-regulated assets. Maintenance
    expenditures, including nuclear refueling and maintenance
    outages, are expensed as incurred. When units of depreciable
    property are retired, the original costs, less salvage value,
    are charged to accumulated depreciation. Asset removal costs
    incurred by our non-rate-regulated operations that do not
    constitute legal obligations are expensed as incurred. Asset
    removal costs accrued by our rate-regulated operations that do
    not constitute legal obligations are classified as a regulatory
    liability. See Asset Retirement Obligations below and
    Note 3 – Property and Plant, Net for further
    information.

Depreciation

Depreciation is provided over the estimated lives of the various
    classes of depreciable property by applying composite rates on a
    straight-line basis. The provision for depreciation for the
    Ameren Companies in 2007, 2006 and 2005 generally ranged from 3%
    to 4% of the average depreciable cost. Due to the Missouri
    electric rate order that became effective in June 2007,
    UE’s annual depreciation expense will be reduced by
    $53 million. Genco’s annual depreciation expense will
    decrease by $12 million according to a depreciation study
    completed in September 2007.

Allowance for
    Funds Used During Construction

In our rate-regulated operations, we capitalize the allowance
    for funds used during construction, as is the



utility industry accounting
    practice. Allowance for funds used during construction does not
    represent a current source of cash funds. This accounting
    practice offsets the effect on earnings of the cost of financing
    current construction, and it treats such financing costs in the
    same manner as construction charges for labor and materials.

Under accepted ratemaking practice, cash recovery of allowance
    for funds used during construction and other construction costs
    occurs when completed projects are placed in service and
    reflected in customer rates. The following table presents the
    allowance for funds used during construction rates that were
    utilized during 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Goodwill and
    Intangible Assets

Goodwill.

As of December 31, 2007, Ameren, CILCORP
    and IP had goodwill of $831 million, $542 million and
    $214 million, respectively. Goodwill represents the excess
    of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of
    the net assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment in
    the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events
    and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
    Ameren’s and IP’s goodwill relates to the acquisitions
    of IP and an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI in 2004,
    and Ameren’s and CILCORP’s goodwill relates to the
    acquisitions of CILCORP and Medina Valley in 2003.

There were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill at any
    of the Ameren Companies for the period from January 1,
    2007, to December 31, 2007.

Intangible Assets.

Ameren’s, UE’s,
    Genco’s, CILCORP’s and CILCO’s intangible assets

Impairment of
    Long-lived Assets

We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment when events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
    such assets may not be recoverable. Whether impairment has
    occurred is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted
    cash flows attributable to the assets with the carrying value of
    the assets. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash
    flows, we recognize the amount of the impairment by estimating
    the fair value of the assets and recording a provision for loss.

Investments

Ameren and UE evaluate for impairment the investments held in
    UE’s nuclear decommissioning trust fund. Investments are
    considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the
    cost basis is estimated to be other than temporary. If the
    decline is determined to be other than temporary, the cost basis
    of the security is written down to fair value. Losses on assets
    in the trust fund could result in higher funding requirements
    for decommissioning costs, which we believe would be recovered
    in electric rates paid by UE’s customers. Accordingly, any
    impairment would likely be recorded as a regulatory asset on
    Ameren’s and UE’s Consolidated Balance



Sheets. Ameren and UE consider,
    among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and
    the extent to which the security’s fair value has been less
    than cost, and UE’s intent and ability to hold the
    investment. See Note 15 – Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments for disclosure of the fair value and unrealized
    gains and losses of UE’s investments.

Environmental
    Costs

Environmental costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and that the
    amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Estimated
    environmental expenditures are regularly reviewed and updated.
    Costs are expensed or deferred as a regulatory asset when it is
    expected that the costs will be recovered from customers in
    future rates. If environmental expenditures are related to
    facilities currently in use, such as pollution control
    equipment, the cost is capitalized and depreciated over the
    expected life of the asset.

Unamortized Debt
    Discount, Premium, and Expense

Discount, premium and expense associated with long-term debt are
    amortized over the lives of the related issues.

Revenue

Operating
    Revenues

UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP record operating revenue for
    electric or gas service when it is delivered to customers. We
    accrue an estimate of electric and gas revenues for service
    rendered but unbilled at the end of each accounting period.

Trading
    Activities

We present the revenues and costs associated with certain energy
    derivative contracts designated as trading on a net basis in
    Operating Revenues – Electric and Other.

Fuel and Gas
    Costs

In UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s Missouri
    and Illinois retail gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas
    costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers
    through PGA clauses.

UE’s cost of nuclear fuel is amortized to fuel expense on a
    unit-of-production basis. Spent fuel disposal cost is based on
    net kilowatthours generated and sold, and that cost is charged
    to expense.

Stock-based
    Compensation

In accounting for stock-based compensation, Ameren measures the
    cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
    equity instruments by the grant-date fair value of the award
    over the requisite service period.

Excise
    Taxes

Excise taxes imposed on us are reflected on Missouri electric,
    Missouri gas, and Illinois gas customer bills. They are recorded
    gross in Operating Revenues and Taxes Other Than Income Taxes on
    the statement of income. Excise taxes reflected on Illinois
    electric customer bills are imposed on the consumer and are
    therefore not included in revenues and expenses. They are
    recorded as tax collections payable and included in Taxes
    Accrued. The following table presents excise taxes recorded in
    Operating Revenues and Taxes Other than Income Taxes for the
    years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Income
    Taxes

Ameren uses an asset and liability approach for its financial
    accounting and reporting of income taxes, in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 109 “Accounting for Income
    Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
    for transactions that are treated differently for financial
    reporting and tax return purposes. These deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are determined by statutory tax rates.

We recognize that regulators will probably reduce future
    revenues for deferred tax liabilities initially recorded at
    rates in excess of the current statutory rate. Therefore,
    reductions in the deferred tax liability, which were recorded
    due to decreases in the statutory rate, were credited to a
    regulatory liability. A regulatory asset has been established to
    recognize the probable future recovery in rates of future income
    taxes resulting principally from the reversal of allowance for
    funds used during construction, that is, equity and temporary
    differences related to property and plant acquired before 1976
    that were unrecognized temporary differences prior to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 109.

Investment tax credits used on tax returns for prior years have
    been deferred for book purposes; they are being amortized over
    the useful lives of the related properties. Deferred income
    taxes were recorded on the temporary difference represented by
    the deferred investment tax credits and a corresponding
    regulatory liability. This recognizes the expected reduction in
    rate revenue for future lower income taxes associated with the
    amortization of the investment tax credits. See
    Note 11 – Income Taxes.



UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP are parties to a tax
    sharing agreement with Ameren that provides for the allocation
    of consolidated tax liabilities. The tax sharing agreement
    provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax similar
    to that which would be owed had the party been separately
    subject to tax. Any net benefit attributable to the parent is
    reallocated to other members. That allocation is treated as a
    contribution to the capital of the party receiving the benefit.

Minority Interest
    and Preferred Dividends of Subsidiaries

For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005,
    Ameren had minority interest expense related to EEI of
    $27 million, $27 million and $3 million,
    respectively, and preferred dividends of subsidiaries of
    $11 million, $11 million, and $13 million,
    respectively.

Earnings Per
    Share

There were no material differences between Ameren’s basic
    and diluted earnings per share amounts in 2007, 2006, and 2005.
    The number of stock options, restricted stock shares, and
    performance share units outstanding was immaterial. The assumed
    stock option conversions increased the number of shares
    outstanding in the diluted earnings per share calculation by
    35,545 shares in 2007, 38,438 shares in 2006, and
    65,917 shares in 2005.

Accounting
    Changes and Other Matters

Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of
    Prior-Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in
    Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108)

In September 2006, the SEC staff issued SAB 108, which
    provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should
    quantify misstatements when evaluating the materiality of
    financial statement errors. SAB 108 requires public
    companies to use a dual approach to assess the quantitative
    effects of financial misstatements. The dual approach includes
    both an income statement-focused assessment and a balance
    sheet-focused assessment. SAB 108 also provides transition
    accounting and disclosure guidance for situations in which a
    material error existed in prior-period financial statements,
    allowing companies to restate prior-period financial statements
    or to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying
    SAB 108 through an adjustment to beginning retained
    earnings in the year of adoption. SAB 108 was effective as
    of December 31, 2006.

Prior to 2000, we concluded that UE’s unbilled revenue was
    understated and CIPS’ unbilled revenue was overstated by a
    similar amount. We previously concluded that these differences
    were immaterial to the financial statements of UE and CIPS for
    all years subsequent to 2000. In connection with our application
    of SAB 108, we recorded a decrease to CIPS’ unbilled
    revenue of $12 million as an adjustment to retained
    earnings. Additionally, we concluded the UE unbilled revenue
    difference was immaterial to its 2006 financial statements.
    Accordingly, we recorded an increase to UE’s unbilled
    revenue of $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 as an
    increase in operating revenues. The adoption of SAB 108 had
    no impact on Ameren’s consolidated results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

FASB Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes – an Interpretation of SFAS No. 109

(FIN 48)

FIN 48 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits
    claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be
    recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, Ameren
    may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
    only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, on the
    technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
    the financial statements from such a position are based on the
    largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being
    realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides
    guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities,
    classification of current and deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties on income
    taxes, and accounting for income taxes in interim periods.
    FIN 48 requires expanded disclosures. The Ameren Companies
    adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007.
    See Note 11 – Income Taxes for additional
    FIN 48 discussion.

SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, which
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value, and expands required disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 clarifies that fair value
    is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on
    the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
    asset or liability. This standard is effective as of the
    beginning of our 2008 fiscal year for financial assets and
    liabilities and as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year for
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those already
    reported at fair value on a recurring basis. The impact of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and
    liabilities at January 1, 2008, was not material. The
    impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities is not expected to be
    material.

SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, Including an Amendment of SFAS No. 115

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, which
    permits companies to choose to measure at fair value many
    financial instruments and certain assets and liabilities that
    are not currently required to be measured at fair value on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis. Entities electing the fair value option will be required
    to recognize changes in fair value in earnings and to expense
    upfront cost and fees associated with the item for which the
    fair value option is elected. SFAS No. 159 was
    effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. We did
    not elect the fair value option for any of our eligible
    financial instruments or other items.

FSP

FIN 39-1,

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39

In April 2007, the FASB issued FSP

FIN 39-1,

effective for us as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year.

FSP FIN 39-1

permits companies to offset fair value



amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a
    receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a
    liability) against fair value amounts recognized for derivative
    instruments that are executed with the same counterparty under
    the same master netting arrangement. We are currently evaluating
    whether we will elect to apply the accounting policies permitted
    under this pronouncement. The adoption of FSP

FIN 39-1

will have no impact on net income, and we do not expect that the
    impact will be material to our financial position.

SFAS No. 141(Revised
    2007),

Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    which replaces SFAS No. 141. SFAS No. 141(R)
    applies to all transactions in which an entity obtains control
    of one or more businesses and combinations without the transfer
    of consideration. SFAS 141(R) requires the acquiring entity
    in a business combination to recognize assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed in the transaction at fair value; it
    requires certain contingent assets and liabilities acquired be
    recognized at their fair values on the acquisition date; and it
    requires expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred,
    among other provisions. SFAS 141(R) will be effective for
    us as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year. It will apply
    prospectively to business combinations completed on or after
    that date.

SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, which
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for minority
    interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling
    interests. Under the provisions of SFAS 160, noncontrolling
    interests will be classified as a component of equity separate
    from the parent’s equity; purchases or sales of equity
    interests that do not result in a change in control will be
    accounted for as equity transactions; net income attributable to
    the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net
    income in the statement of income; and upon a loss of control,
    the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be
    recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in
    earnings. SFAS 160 will be effective for us as of the
    beginning of our 2009 fiscal year. It will apply prospectively,
    except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, for
    which it will apply retroactively. This standard will be
    applicable to the minority interest in EEI, as it is 80% owned
    by Ameren Corporation.

Asset Retirement
    Obligations

SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations,

and FIN 47,

Accounting for Conditional
    Asset Retirement Obligations – an Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 143,

require us to record the
    estimated fair value of legal obligations associated with the
    retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which
    the liabilities are incurred and to capitalize a corresponding
    amount as part of the book value of the related long-lived
    asset. In subsequent periods, we are required to make
    adjustments in AROs based on changes in estimated fair value.
    Corresponding increases in asset book values are depreciated
    over the remaining useful life of the related asset.
    Uncertainties as to the probability, timing or amount of cash
    flows associated with AROs affect our estimates of fair value.
    Upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47, Ameren,
    UE, Genco, CILCORP, and CILCO recorded AROs for retirement costs
    associated with UE’s Callaway nuclear plant decommissioning
    costs, asbestos removal, ash ponds, and river structures. In
    addition, Ameren, UE, CIPS, and IP recorded AROs for the
    disposal of certain transformers.

Asset removal costs accrued by our rate-regulated operations
    that do not constitute legal obligations are classified as a
    regulatory liability. See Note 2 – Rate and
    Regulatory Matters.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning
    and ending carrying amount of AROs for the years 2007 and 2006:

Variable-interest
    Entities

According to FIN 46R, “Variable-interest
    Entities,” an entity is considered a variable-interest
    entity (VIE) if it does not have sufficient equity to finance
    its activities without assistance from variable interest
    holders, or if its equity investors lack any of the following
    characteristics of a controlling financial interest: control
    through voting rights, the obligation to absorb expected losses,
    or the right to receive expected residual returns. We have
    determined that the following significant VIEs were held by the
    Ameren Companies at December 31, 2007:

•

Tolling agreement.

CILCO has a variable interest in
    Medina Valley through a tolling agreement to purchase steam,
    chilled water, and electricity. We have concluded that CILCO is
    not the primary beneficiary of Medina Valley. Accordingly, CILCO
    does not consolidate Medina Valley. The maximum exposure to loss
    as a result of this variable interest in the tolling agreement
    is not material.

•

Leveraged lease and affordable housing partnership
    investments

. Ameren and UE have investments in
    affordable housing and low-income real estate development
    partnership arrangements that are variable interests. Ameren
    also has an investment in a leveraged lease. We have concluded
    that Ameren and UE are not primary beneficiaries of any of the
    VIEs related to these investments. The maximum exposure to loss
    as a result of these variable interests is limited to the
    investments in these arrangements. At December 31, 2007,
    Ameren and UE had investments in affordable housing and
    low-income real estate development partnerships of
    $100 million and $15 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2007, Ameren had a net investment in a
    leveraged lease of $9 million.

•

IP SPT.

IP has a variable interest in IP SPT, which
    was established in 1998 to issue TFNs. IP has indemnified and is
    liable to IP SPT if IP does not bill the applicable charges to
    its customers on behalf of IP SPT or if it does not remit the
    collections to IP SPT; however, the note holders are considered
    the primary beneficiaries of this special-purpose trust.
    Accordingly, Ameren and IP do not consolidate IP SPT.

NOTE 2 –

RATE AND
    REGULATORY MATTERS

Below is a summary of significant regulatory proceedings and
    related lawsuits. We are unable to predict the ultimate outcome
    of these matters, the timing of the final decisions of the
    various agencies and courts, or the impact on our results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Missouri

Electric

With the expiration of an electric rate moratorium that provided
    for no changes in UE’s electric rates before July 1,
    2006, UE filed in July 2006 a request with the MoPSC for an
    average increase in electric rates of 17.7%, or
    $361 million, based on a requested return on equity of
    12.0%. This rate increase filing was based on a test year ended
    June 30, 2006, and was updated for known and measurable
    items through January 1, 2007.

In May 2007, the MoPSC issued an order, as clarified, granting
    UE a $43 million increase in base rates for electric
    service based on a return on equity of 10.2% and a capital
    structure of 52% common equity. New electric rates became
    effective June 4, 2007. The MoPSC order also included the
    following significant provisions:

•

Acceptance without rate adjustment of the expiration of
    UE’s cost-based power supply contract with EEI, which
    expired in December 2005.

•

Allowance of the full cost of certain CTs purchased or built in
    the past few years to be included in UE’s rate base.

•

Establishment of a regulatory tracking mechanism, through the
    use of a regulatory liability account, for gains on sales of
    SO


emission allowances, net of
    SO


premiums incurred under the terms of coal procurement contracts,
    plus any
    SO


discounts received under such contracts. These deferred amounts
    will be addressed as part of UE’s next rate case. The MoPSC
    allowed an annual base level of
    SO


emission allowance sales of up to $5 million, which UE can
    recognize in its statement of income.

•

Approval of a regulatory tracking mechanism for pension and
    postretirement benefit costs.

•

Change of income tax method associated with the cost of property
    removal, net of salvage, to the normalization method of
    accounting, which reduced income tax expense in the calculation
    of UE’s electric rates and in financial reporting.

•

Establishment of off-system sales base level of
    $230 million used in determining UE’s revenue
    requirement.

•

Extension of UE’s Callaway nuclear plant and fossil
    generation plant lives used in calculating depreciation expense
    for electric rates and financial reporting purposes.

•

MoPSC staff directed to review a possible loss in capacity sales
    as a result of the breach of the upper reservoir of the Taum
    Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility. The review is still
    pending.

•

Establishment of a requirement to fund low-income energy
    assistance and energy conservation programs; half of such
    funding will be recoverable through rates to customers.

•

Denial of UE’s request to implement a fuel and purchased
    power cost recovery mechanism.

In June 2007, the MoPSC denied UE’s and other
    intervenors’ applications for a rehearing with respect to
    certain aspects of the MoPSC rate order. In July 2007, UE
    appealed certain aspects of the MoPSC decision, principally the
    10.2% return on equity granted by the MoPSC, to the Circuit
    Court of Cole County in Jefferson City, Missouri. The Office of
    Public Counsel and the Missouri attorney general, who were both
    parties in the electric rate case, also appealed certain aspects
    of the MoPSC decision to the



Circuit Court of Cole County. In December 2007, the Circuit
    Court of Cole County sustained the MoPSC rate order in all
    respects. In January 2008, UE and the other parties appealed the
    Circuit Court of Cole County’s decision to the Court of
    Appeals for the Western District of Missouri.

Gas

In March 2007, the MoPSC approved a stipulation and agreement
    that resolved a July 2006 request by UE to increase annual
    natural gas delivery revenues by $11 million. The
    stipulation and agreement authorized an increase in annual
    natural gas delivery revenues of $6 million, effective
    April 1, 2007. Other principal provisions of the
    stipulation and agreement include:

•

UE’s agreement to not file a natural gas delivery rate case
    before March 15, 2010. This agreement did not prevent UE
    from filing to recover infrastructure replacement costs through
    an ISRS during this three-year rate moratorium. The return on
    equity to be used by UE for purposes of an ISRS tariff filing is
    10.0%.

•

Authorization for UE to transition from four PGA rates to a
    single PGA rate for all its gas customers.

In February 2008, the MoPSC approved UE’s petition
    requesting the establishment of an ISRS to recover annual
    revenues of $1 million effective March 29, 2008.

Cost Recovery
    Mechanisms

A Missouri law enacted in July 2005 enables the MoPSC to put in
    place fuel and purchased power and environmental cost recovery
    mechanisms for Missouri’s utilities. The law also includes
    rate case filing requirements, a 2.5% annual rate increase cap
    for the environmental cost recovery mechanism, and prudency
    reviews, among other things. Rules for the fuel and purchased
    power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the MoPSC in
    September 2006 and became effective during the fourth quarter of
    2006. Rules for the environmental cost recovery mechanism were
    approved by the MoPSC in February 2008 and will be effective
    once published in the Missouri Register. UE will not be able to
    use the cost recovery mechanisms until so authorized by the
    MoPSC as part of a rate case proceeding.

Taum
    Sauk

In June 2007, the MoPSC opened an investigation of the breach of
    the upper reservoir at UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage
    hydroelectric facility in December 2005. In December 2007, the
    MoPSC issued an order receiving the MoPSC staff report on the
    Taum Sauk incident. The order, which did not require UE to
    implement any of the staff recommendations, noted that UE
    voluntarily agreed to implement almost all of the
    recommendations, and it closed the investigation. See
    Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies for
    additional information.

January 2007 Ice
    Storm Cost Recovery

UE submitted a filing to the MoPSC in November 2007 requesting
    that operations and maintenance expenses UE incurred as a result
    of a severe ice storm in January 2007 be deferred as a
    regulatory asset and, if approved, be amortized over five years
    beginning with the effective date of electric rates approved in
    UE’s next rate proceeding. UE incurred approximately
    $25 million of operations and maintenance expenses in the
    first quarter of 2007 as a result of the January storm. In
    January 2008, the MoPSC staff recommended that the MoPSC grant
    UE’s request with the amortization to commence on
    January 15, 2007. The MoPSC is expected to issue an order
    on UE’s filing in 2008. If approved by the MoPSC, this
    would only provide UE approval to defer the expenses incurred as
    a regulatory asset. The appropriate amount to be amortized would
    be decided in UE’s next rate proceeding.

Illinois

Electric

New electric rates for CIPS, CILCO and IP went into effect on
    January 2, 2007, reflecting delivery service tariffs
    approved by the ICC in November 2006 and full cost recovery of
    power purchased on behalf of Ameren Illinois Utilities’
    customers in the September 2006 auction in accordance with a
    January 2006 ICC order. These new electric rates were expected
    to raise average annual residential rates overall in 2007 by 40%
    to 55% over 2006 rates. The average annual residential rate
    overall increase for electric heat customers was expected to be
    60% to 80% over 2006 rates.

Due to the magnitude of these rate increases, various
    legislators supported legislation that would have reduced and
    frozen CIPS, CILCO and IP electric rates at the levels in effect
    prior to January 2, 2007, and would have imposed a tax on
    electric generation in Illinois to help fund customer assistance
    programs. The Illinois governor also supported rate rollback and
    freeze legislation. In July 2007, an agreement was reached among
    key stakeholders in Illinois to avoid such legislation and
    address the increase in electric rates and the future power
    procurement process in Illinois. The terms of the agreement,
    which includes a comprehensive rate relief and customer
    assistance program, were set forth in a letter dated
    July 24, 2007, to the leaders of the Illinois General
    Assembly and the Illinois attorney general. They also appear in
    a release and settlement agreement with the Illinois attorney
    general, in funding agreements among the parties contributing to
    the rate relief and assistance programs, and in legislation that
    became effective on August 28, 2007. The following
    discussion of the Illinois electric settlement agreement
    includes its impact on future power procurement for the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities and other significant regulatory and related
    legal matters that affect our Illinois electric operations.

Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement

The Illinois electric settlement agreement was the result of
    many months of negotiations among leaders of the Illinois



House of Representatives and Senate, the office of the Illinois
    attorney general, Ameren, on behalf of its affiliates, including
    Marketing Company, Genco and AERG, the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities, Exelon Corporation (Exelon), on behalf of Exelon
    Generation Company LLC, Commonwealth Edison Company
    (Commonwealth Edison), Exelon’s Illinois electric utility
    subsidiary, Dynegy Holdings Inc., Midwest Generation, LLC, and
    MidAmerican Energy Company. The Illinois electric settlement
    agreement provides approximately $1 billion of funding for
    rate relief for certain electric customers in Illinois,
    including approximately $488 million to customers of the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities. Pursuant to the Illinois electric
    settlement agreement, the Ameren Illinois Utilities, Genco and
    AERG agreed to make aggregate contributions of $150 million
    over a four-year period, with $60 million coming from the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities (CIPS – $21 million;
    CILCO –  $11 million; IP –
    $28 million), $62 million from Genco, and
    $28 million from AERG. Below is a summary of the total
    customer relief and assistance to be provided to the customers
    of the Ameren Illinois Utilities, the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities’, Genco’s and AERG’s portion of the
    funding that has been or is expected to be disbursed, and the
    earnings per share impact as a result of the program and
    agreement.

The Ameren Illinois Utilities, Genco and AERG will recognize in
    their financial statements the costs of their respective rate
    relief contributions and program funding in a manner
    corresponding with the timing of the funding shown in the above
    table. Ameren, CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated), IP, Genco, and
    CILCO (AERG) incurred charges to earnings, primarily recorded as
    a reduction to electric operating revenues, of $82 million,
    $12 million, $7 million, $15 million,
    $33 million, and $15 million, respectively, under the
    terms of the Illinois electric settlement agreement including
    the forgiveness of $3 million of outstanding customer late
    payments during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Other electric generators and utilities in Illinois agreed to
    contribute $851 million to the comprehensive rate relief
    and customer assistance program. Contributions by the other
    electric generators (the Generators) and utilities to the
    comprehensive program are subject to funding agreements. Under
    these agreements, at the end of each month, the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities send a bill, due in 30 days, to the Generators
    and utilities for their proportionate share of that month’s
    rate relief and assistance. If any escrow funds have been
    provided by the Generators, these funds will be drawn prior to
    seeking reimbursement from the Generators. At December 31,
    2007, Ameren, CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP had
    receivable balances from nonaffiliated Illinois generators for
    reimbursement of customer rate relief and program funding of
    $34 million, $13 million, $7 million and
    $14 million, respectively.

The Illinois electric settlement agreement preserves existing
    rates and rate structures. The Ameren Illinois Utilities retain
    the right to file new electric delivery service rate cases with
    the ICC at the respective utility’s discretion. See
    Electric and Natural Gas Delivery Service Rate Cases below for
    information on pending electric delivery service rate increase
    requests filed by the Ameren Illinois Utilities. The Illinois
    electric settlement agreement provides that if legislation is
    enacted in Illinois before August 1, 2011, freezing or
    reducing retail electric rates, or imposing or authorizing a new
    tax, special assessment, or fee on the generation of electricity
    then the remaining commitments under the Illinois electric
    settlement agreement would expire, and any funds set aside in
    support of the commitments would be refunded to the utilities
    and Generators.

As part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, the
    reverse auction used for power procurement in Illinois was
    discontinued. It will be replaced with a new power procurement
    process to be led by the IPA, beginning in 2009. In 2008,
    Illinois utilities will contract for necessary power and energy
    requirements primarily through a request-for-proposal process,
    subject to ICC review and approval. The ICC approved the
    proposed 2008 power procurement plans of the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities in December 2007. Existing supply contracts from the
    September 2006 reverse auction remain in place. In the September
    2006 auction, the Ameren Illinois Utilities procured power to
    serve the electric load needs of fixed price residential and
    small commercial customers with one-third of the supply
    contracts expiring in May 2008, one-third expiring in May 2009
    and one-third expiring in May 2010.

As part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities entered into financial contracts with
    Marketing Company (for the benefit of Genco and AERG), to
    lock-in energy prices for 400 to 1,000 megawatts annually of
    their around-the-clock power requirements during the period
    June 1, 2008, to December 31, 2012, at relevant market
    prices. These financial contracts do not include capacity, are
    not load-following products, and do not involve the physical
    delivery of energy. These financial contracts became effective
    on August 28, 2007, when legislation in connection with the
    Illinois electric settlement agreement became law. Below are



the contracted volumes and prices per megawatthour.

The financial contracts provide that if any one of the following
    events occurs during their term, the Ameren Illinois Utilities
    and Marketing Company will meet as soon as practicable, but no
    later than 30 days after the date such event occurs, to
    identify and discuss its effect on the terms and conditions of,
    and prices under the financial contracts: (a) a state tax
    on electric generation; (b) a state or federal tax on

and/or

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., a carbon tax); or
    (c) enactment of an Illinois law that eliminates retail
    electric supplier choice for the residential and small
    commercial customers of the Ameren Illinois Utilities. The
    financial contracts also provide that if any one of these events
    occurs, the parties to the financial contracts will negotiate to
    determine in a commercially reasonable manner whether the
    affected terms, conditions and prices can be revised so as to
    preserve the economic benefits of the financial contracts for
    all parties and, if so, to revise the financial contracts
    accordingly. In the event the parties to the financial contracts
    are not able to agree on such revisions, Marketing Company may
    terminate the financial contracts by written notice no earlier
    than 60 days and no later than 90 days after such
    event occurs, with the termination being effective when notice
    is given. Under the terms of the Illinois electric settlement
    agreement, these financial contracts are deemed prudent, and the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities are permitted full recovery of their
    costs in rates.

Beginning in June 2009, power procurement will be accomplished
    primarily through competitive requests for proposals to supply
    power and energy needs of the utility instead of the full
    requirements, load-following supply contracts previously
    procured through the reverse auction. The new power procurement
    process would require the IPA to develop an annual Procurement
    Plan (the Plan) for the Ameren Illinois Utilities and
    Commonwealth Edison. Each Plan would govern a utility’s
    procurement of power to meet the expected load requirements that
    are not met by preexisting contracts or generation facilities.
    Subject to ICC approval, the Ameren Illinois Utilities would be
    allowed to lease or invest in generation facilities. The
    objective of each Plan would be to ensure adequate, reliable,
    affordable, efficient, and environmentally sustainable electric
    service at the lowest total cost over time, taking into account
    any benefits of price stability for the utilities’ eligible
    retail customers. The new power procurement process provides
    that each Plan be submitted to the ICC for initial approval; if
    it is approved, the final design and implementation of a Plan
    would be overseen by an independent procurement administrator
    selected by the IPA and a procurement monitor selected by the
    ICC. The IPA has broad authority to assist in the procurement of
    electric power for residential and nonresidential customers
    beginning in June 2009. Winning proposals will be selected on
    the basis of price, compared for reasonableness to benchmarks
    developed by the procurement administrator and procurement
    monitor, and approved by the ICC.

The power procurement process provides for the subject electric
    utility in Illinois to file proposed tariffs with the ICC, which
    will be designed to pass through to customers the costs of
    procuring electric power supply with no markup by the utility,
    plus any reasonable costs that the utility incurs in arranging
    and providing for the supply of electric power. All such
    procurement costs will be deemed to have been prudently incurred
    and will be recoverable through rates.

The Illinois electric settlement agreement provides that the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities have a right to maintain membership in
    a FERC-approved regional transmission organization of their
    choice for a period of at least 15 years.

The Illinois electric settlement agreement also includes a
    commitment to energy conservation programs designed to reduce
    energy consumption through increased energy efficiency and
    demand response. In addition, 2% of the Illinois utilities’
    electricity is to be procured from renewable sources beginning
    June 1, 2008, with that percentage increasing in subsequent
    years, subject to limits on customer rate impacts. The provision
    for full and timely recovery of the cost of these commitments is
    also included in the Illinois electric settlement agreement.

Pursuant to the Illinois electric settlement agreement, all
    previously pending litigation and regulatory actions by the
    office of the Illinois attorney general relating to the reverse
    auction procurement process, which was used to determine
    market-based rates effective January 1, 2007, and the
    alleged electric space heating marketing practices of the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities have been withdrawn with prejudice. These
    withdrawn litigation and regulatory actions included those filed
    by the office of the attorney general with FERC, the ICC, the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
    the Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit Jackson County,
    Illinois, and the Appellate Court of Illinois, Second Judicial
    Circuit.

Finally, the Illinois electric settlement agreement establishes
    the authority to obtain accelerated review by the ICC of a
    merger or combination of the three Ameren Illinois Utilities, if
    it is requested in the future.

Appeals of 2006 ICC Procurement Order

The Illinois attorney general, CUB, and ELPC appealed to
    Illinois district appellate courts the ICC’s denial of
    rehearing requests with respect to its January 2006 order, which
    approved the power procurement auction and related tariffs. In
    August 2006, the Supreme Court of Illinois ordered that the
    appeals be consolidated in the appellate court for the Second
    Judicial Circuit in Illinois. The Illinois attorney
    general’s appeal was withdrawn as part of the Illinois
    electric



settlement agreement. In September 2007, the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities filed a motion to dismiss the appeals of CUB and ELPC,
    which was granted in October 2007. No further appeals have been
    filed.

Power Procurement Auction Lawsuits

Ameren, CIPS, CILCO, IP, Commonwealth Edison and its parent
    company, Exelon, and 15 other electricity suppliers, including
    Marketing Company, which are selling power to the Illinois
    utilities pursuant to contracts entered into as a result of the
    September 2006 power procurement auction, were named as
    defendants in two similar lawsuits. Plaintiffs were filed in the
    Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois in March 2007, seeking
    class action status to represent all customers who purchased
    electric service from Commonwealth Edison Company or the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities. Both lawsuits alleged, among other things,
    that the Illinois utilities and the power suppliers illegally
    manipulated prices in the September 2006 power procurement
    auction. Plaintiffs sought actual and punitive damages. In
    December 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of Illinois granted the defendants’ motion to
    dismiss the lawsuits, and the time to appeal this court decision
    has expired.

Redesigned
    Rates

In late 2007, the ICC issued an order, as amended, authorizing
    redesigned electric rates for CIPS, CILCO and IP that was
    implemented January 1, 2008. These rates were designed to
    allow utilities to recover their full costs while reducing
    seasonal fluctuations for residential customers who use large
    amounts of electricity. The redesigned rates will not change
    total annual revenues collected by the Ameren Illinois Utilities
    in 2008 and subsequent years.

Electric and
    Natural Gas Delivery Service Rate Cases

CIPS, CILCO and IP filed requests with the ICC in November 2007
    to increase their annual revenues for electric delivery service
    by $180 million in the aggregate (CIPS –
    $31 million, CILCO – $10 million, and
    IP – $139 million). The Ameren Illinois Utilities
    pledged in 2007 to keep overall residential electric bill
    increase to less than 10% for each utility in their next rate
    filings. These filings are consistent with that pledge.
    Accordingly, the requested rate increase for IP residential
    customers is to be capped at the 10% increase level in the first
    year of the increase, even if the final authorized rate increase
    exceeds that amount. This rate increase limit could result in
    approximately $30 million of the requested increase not
    being phased in until the second year. The amount of CIPS’
    and CILCO’s requested increases did not require inclusion
    of similar limits, as they were within the scope of the pledge.
    The electric rate increase requests are based on an 11% return
    on equity, a capital structure composed of 51% to 53% equity, an
    aggregate rate base for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of
    $2.1 billion and a test year ended December 31, 2006,
    with certain prospective updates.

CIPS, CILCO and IP filed requests with the ICC in November 2007
    to increase their annual revenues for natural gas delivery
    service by $67 million in the aggregate (CIPS –
    $15 million increase, CILCO – $4 million
    decrease and IP – $56 million increase). The
    natural gas rate change requests are based on an 11% return on
    equity, a capital structure composed of 51% to 53% equity, an
    aggregate rate base for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of
    $0.9 billion, and a test year ended December 31, 2006,
    with certain prospective updates.

In their filings, the Ameren Illinois Utilities have also
    requested that the ICC approve to implement mechanisms that
    would permit the reconciliation and adjustment of actual bad
    debt expenses to those established in rates set by the ICC for
    electric and gas customers. The filings also seek a more timely
    recovery of investments in existing electric distribution plant.
    Because general rate adjustment proceedings require up to
    11 months in Illinois, these mechanisms would allow current
    revenues to better match current costs. In addition, the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities are seeking approval of a revenue decoupling
    rate adjustment mechanism as a part of their natural gas
    delivery service rate change requests. This mechanism would
    separate each utility’s fixed cost recovery from the volume
    of gas it sells by providing a periodic

true-up

of
    revenues. The periodic

true-up

would result in adjustments to a utility’s ICC-approved
    tariffs based on increases or decreases in demand for natural
    gas.

The ICC proceedings relating to the proposed electric and
    natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a
    period of up to 11 months, and decisions by the ICC in such
    proceedings are required by the end of September 2008. The
    Ameren Illinois Utilities cannot predict the level of any
    delivery service rate change the ICC may approve, when any rate
    change may go into effect, whether any rate adjustment mechanism
    discussed above will be approved, or whether any rate increase
    eventually approved will be sufficient for the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities to recover their costs and earn a reasonable return on
    their investments when the increase goes into effect.

Electric and
    Natural Gas Energy Efficiency Plans

In November 2007, the Ameren Illinois Utilities filed an
    electric energy efficiency and demand response plan with the
    ICC. The plan is designed to reduce electricity usage by
    specific targeted amounts set forth in the Illinois electric
    settlement agreement. The Ameren Illinois Utilities’
    spending limit under this plan for the 2008, 2009 and 2010
    program years is $14 million, $29 million and
    $45 million, respectively. In February 2008, the ICC issued
    an order approving the Ameren Illinois Utilities’ energy
    efficiency and demand response plan, as well as the cost
    recovery mechanism by which the program costs will be recovered.

In February 2008, the Ameren Illinois Utilities filed a natural
    gas energy efficiency plan with the ICC. The plan was filed as
    part of the November 2007 natural gas delivery service rate
    cases. The Ameren Illinois Utilities proposed to offer natural
    gas energy efficiency programs in conjunction with a revenue
    decoupling rate adjustment mechanism. The



natural gas energy efficiency plan includes annual reduction
    targets in energy usage as well as proposed funding levels for
    2009, 2010, and 2011 of $4 million, $5 million and
    $6 million, respectively. The ICC is expected to issue an
    order on the Ameren Illinois Utilities’ filing by September
    2008.

Federal

Regional
    Transmission Organization

UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are transmission-owning members of
    MISO, which is a FERC-regulated RTO that provides transmission
    tariff administration services for electric transmission
    systems. In early 2004, UE received authorization from the MoPSC
    to participate in MISO for a five-year period, with further
    participation subject to approvals by the MoPSC. The MoPSC
    required UE to file a study evaluating the costs and benefits of
    its participation in MISO prior to the end of the five-year
    period. The MoPSC also directed UE to enter into a service
    agreement for MISO to provide transmission service to UE’s
    bundled retail customers. The service agreement’s primary
    function was to ensure that the MoPSC continued to set the
    transmission component of UE’s rates to serve its bundled
    retail load. In particular, the service agreement provided that
    UE would not pay MISO for transmission service to UE’s
    bundled retail customers. FERC approved the service agreement in
    the form that was acceptable to the MoPSC.

Due to recent changes to MISO’s allocation of transmission
    revenues to transmission owners, UE believed it should receive
    incremental annual transmission revenues of $60 million as
    of February 2008 based on its service agreement with MISO.
    Numerous transmission owners in MISO, along with MISO itself as
    the tariff administrator, filed with FERC in December 2007
    requesting changes to the MISO tariff to prevent UE from
    collecting these additional transmission revenues. In December
    2007, UE filed a protest to these proposed MISO tariff changes
    as unauthorized and improper in light of the MoPSC’s
    requirement for the service agreement between UE and MISO
    discussed above. In February 2008, FERC issued an order
    accepting the MISO tariff changes proposed by MISO and
    transmission owners in MISO. UE intends to request FERC for a
    rehearing of its order.

As required by the MoPSC, UE filed a study in November 2007 with
    the MoPSC evaluating the costs and benefits of UE’s
    participation in MISO. UE’s filing noted that there were a
    number of uncertainties associated with the cost-benefit study,
    including issues associated with the UE-MISO service agreement
    discussed above. If some of these uncertainties are ultimately
    resolved in a manner adverse to UE, it could call into question
    whether it is cost-effective for UE to remain in MISO. UE has
    advised MISO of its intent to withdraw from MISO as of
    December 31, 2008, in order to preserve the option to
    withdraw based on the outcome of the pending MoPSC proceeding.
    It is uncertain when or how the MoPSC will rule on UE’s
    MISO cost-benefit study or, if UE were to withdraw from MISO,
    what the effect of such a withdrawal would be on UE.

Seams Elimination
    Cost Adjustment

Pursuant to a series of FERC orders, FERC put Seams Elimination
    Cost Adjustment (SECA) charges into effect on December 1,
    2004, subject to refund and hearing procedures. The SECA charges
    were a transition mechanism in place for 16 months from
    December 1, 2004, to March 31, 2006, to compensate
    transmission owners in the MISO and PJM for revenues lost when
    FERC eliminated the regional

through-and-out

rates previously applicable to transactions crossing the border
    between the MISO and PJM. The SECA charge was a nonbypassable
    surcharge payable by load-serving entities in proportion to the
    benefit they realized from the elimination of the regional

through-and-out

rates as of December 1, 2004. The MISO transmission owners
    (including UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP) and the PJM transmission
    owners filed their proposed SECA charges in November 2004 as
    compliance filings pursuant to FERC order. A FERC administrative
    law judge issued an initial decision in August 2006,
    recommending that FERC reject both of the SECA compliance
    filings (the filing for SECA charges made by the transmission
    owners in the MISO and the filing for SECA charges made by the
    transmission owners in PJM). There is no scheduled date for FERC
    to act on the initial decision. Both before and after the
    initial decision, various parties (including UE, CIPS, CILCO and
    IP as part of the group of MISO transmission owners) filed
    numerous bilateral or multiparty settlements. FERC has approved
    many of the settlements. FERC has rejected none of the
    settlements but a number have been pending for some time.
    Neither the MISO transmission owners, including UE, CIPS, CILCO
    and IP, nor the PJM transmission owners have been able to settle
    with all parties. During the transition period of
    December 1, 2004 to March 31, 2006, Ameren, UE, CIPS,
    and IP received net revenues from the SECA charge of
    $10 million, $3 million, $1 million, and
    $6 million, respectively. CILCO’s net SECA
    charges were less than $1 million. Until FERC acts on the
    pending settlements and issues a final order on the initial
    decision, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the SECA
    proceedings on UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s
    costs and revenues.

FERC
    Order – MISO Charges

In May 2007, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP filed with the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
    an appeal of FERC’s March 2007 order involving the
    reallocation of certain MISO operational costs among MISO
    participants, retroactive to 2005. In August 2007, the court
    granted FERC’s motion to hold the appeal in abeyance
    pending completion of the continuing proceedings at FERC
    regarding the allocation of these costs. Other MISO participants
    also filed appeals. In November 2007, FERC issued two orders
    relative to these allocation matters. One of these orders
    addressed requests for rehearing of prior orders in the
    proceedings, and one concerned MISO’s compliance with
    FERC’s orders to date in the proceedings. In December 2007,
    UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP requested FERC’s clarification or
    rehearing of its November 2007 order regarding MISO’s
    compliance with FERC’s orders. UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP
    maintain that MISO is required to reallocate certain of



MISO’s operational costs among
    MISO market participants resulting in refunds to UE, CIPS,
    CILCO, and IP. This request and those of other parties are
    pending.

UE Power Purchase
    Agreement with Entergy Arkansas, Inc.

In July 2007, as a consequence of a series of orders issued by
    FERC addressing a complaint filed by the Louisiana Public
    Service Commission against Entergy Arkansas, Inc. (Entergy) and
    certain of its affiliates, which alleged unjust and unreasonable
    cost allocations, Entergy commenced billing UE for additional
    charges under a

165-megawatt

power purchase agreement. The additional charges to UE were
    $12 million in 2007. Additional amounts are expected during
    the remainder of the term of the power purchase agreement, which
    expires effective August 25, 2009. Although UE was not a
    party to FERC proceedings that gave rise to these additional
    charges, UE intervened in August 2007 in a related FERC
    proceeding to challenge the additional charges. UE is unable to
    predict whether FERC will grant any relief.

Leveraged
    Leases

With the acquisition of CILCORP and the merger with CIPSCO,
    Ameren acquired interests in certain assets that were financed
    as leveraged leases. By orders issued pursuant to PUHCA 1935,
    the SEC determined that certain nonutility interests and
    investments of CILCORP, CIPSCO and their subsidiaries, including
    investments in several leveraged leases, which primarily
    consisted of lease interests in commercial real estate
    properties and equipment, were not retainable by Ameren. The SEC
    orders required that Ameren cause its subsidiaries to sell or
    otherwise dispose of the nonretainable interests. All leveraged
    leases held by CILCORP and its subsidiaries that were required
    to be divested by an SEC order were sold by the end of 2006.
    CILCORP no longer owns any leveraged lease assets. With respect
    to the leveraged lease asset subject to a SEC divestiture order
    held by CIPSCO, the lessee of the asset declared bankruptcy and
    the value of the investment was written off by Ameren in 2005.
    CIPSCO had two other leveraged lease assets that were not
    subject to an SEC divestiture order. One of those lease
    investments was sold in 2007, and one is still owned by CIPSCO.

In 2007, the overall net gain before taxes from the sale of
    leveraged lease assets recognized by Ameren was $4 million.
    In 2006, the overall net gains (losses) before taxes from the
    sale of all leveraged lease assets recognized by Ameren, CILCORP
    and CILCO were $3 million, ($7 million), and
    ($11 million), respectively.

Hydroelectric
    License Renewal

On March 30, 2007, FERC granted a new

40-year

license for UE’s Osage hydroelectric plant and approved a
    settlement agreement among UE, the U.S. Department of the
    Interior and various state agencies that was submitted in May
    2005 in support of the license renewal.

Regulatory Assets
    and Liabilities

In accordance with SFAS No. 71, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP
    defer certain costs pursuant to actions of regulators and are
    currently recovering such costs in rates charged to customers.

UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP continually assess the
    recoverability of their regulatory assets. Under current
    accounting standards, regulatory assets are written off to
    earnings when it is no longer probable that such amounts will be
    recovered through future revenues.

    facility located in Audrain County, Missouri, at a price of
    $115 million from NRG Audrain Holding LLC, and NRG Audrain
    Generating LLC, affiliates of NRG Energy Inc. (collectively,
    NRG). As a part of this transaction, UE was assigned the rights
    of NRG as lessee of the CT facility under a long-term lease with
    Audrain County, and UE assumed NRG’s obligations under the
    lease. The lease will expire on December 1, 2023.

Also in March 2006, following the receipt of all required
    regulatory approvals, UE completed the purchase from
    subsidiaries of Aquila Inc., of the 510-megawatt Goose Creek CT
    facility in Piatt County, Illinois, at a price of
    $106 million, and the

340-megawatt

Raccoon Creek CT facility located in Clay County, Illinois, at a

At December 31, 2007, Ameren and certain of its
    subsidiaries had $2.15 billion of committed credit
    facilities, consisting of the three facilities shown above, in
    the amounts of $1.15 billion, $500 million, and
    $500 million maturing in July 2010, January 2010, and
    January 2010, respectively.

Ameren can directly borrow under the $1.15 billion
    facility, as amended, up to the entire amount of the facility.
    UE can directly borrow under this facility up to
    $500 million on a

364-day

basis. Genco can directly borrow under this facility up to
    $150 million on a

364-day

basis. The amended facility will terminate on July 14,
    2010, with respect to Ameren. The termination date for UE and
    Genco is July 10, 2008, subject to the annual

364-day

renewal provisions of the facility.

Under the $1.15 billion credit facility, the principal
    amount of each revolving loan will be due and payable no later
    than the final maturity of the facility in the case of Ameren
    and the last day of the then-applicable

364-day

period in the case of UE and Genco. Swingline loans will be made
    on

same-day

notice and will mature five business days after they are made.



Ameren, UE and Genco will use the proceeds of any borrowings
    under the facility for general corporate purposes, including for
    working capital, commercial paper liquidity support, and to fund
    loans under the Ameren money pool arrangements.

CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG are parties to a
    $500 million multiyear, senior secured credit facility
    expiring in 2010 (the 2006 $500 million credit facility).

CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG are parties to another
    $500 million multiyear, senior secured credit facility (the
    2007 $500 million credit facility), also expiring in
    January 2010.

The obligations of each borrower under the 2006
    $500 million credit facility and the 2007 $500 million
    credit facility are several and not joint, and are not
    guaranteed by Ameren or any other subsidiary of Ameren. The
    maximum amount available to each borrower under the 2006
    $500 million credit facility, including for issuance of
    letters of credit on its behalf, is limited as follows:
    CIPS – $135 million, CILCORP –
    $50 million, CILCO – $75 million,
    IP – $150 million and AERG –
    $200 million. Each of the companies has drawn various loans
    under this credit facility. Under the 2007 $500 million
    credit facility, the maximum amount available to each borrower,
    including for issuance of letters of credit on its behalf, is
    limited as follows: CILCORP – $125 million,
    CILCO – $75 million, IP –
    $200 million and AERG – $100 million. CIPS
    and CILCO have the option of permanently reducing their
    borrowing authority under the 2006 $500 million credit
    facility and shifting, in one or more transactions, such
    capacity to the 2007 $500 million credit facility up to the
    same limits. The total borrowing authority of CIPS and CILCO
    under the 2006 $500 million credit facility and the 2007
    $500 million credit facility cannot at any time exceed
    $135 million and $150 million, respectively, in the
    aggregate. Until either CIPS or CILCO elects to increase its
    borrowing capacity under the 2007 $500 million credit
    facility and issue first mortgage bonds as security for its
    obligations thereunder, as described below, it will not be
    considered a borrower under the 2007 $500 million credit
    facility and will not be subject to the covenants thereof
    (except as a subsidiary of a borrower). The borrowing companies
    will use the proceeds of any borrowings for working capital and
    other general corporate purposes; however, a portion of the
    borrowings by AERG may be limited to financing or refinancing
    the development, management and operation of any of its projects
    or assets. The 2006 and 2007 $500 million credit facilities
    will terminate on January 14, 2010.

The obligations of CIPS, CILCO and IP under the 2006
    $500 million facility are secured by the issuance of
    mortgage bonds by each such utility under its respective
    mortgage indenture in the amounts of $135 million,
    $75 million and $150 million, respectively. The
    obligations of CILCO and IP under the 2007 $500 million
    credit facility are secured by the issuance of mortgage bonds in
    the amounts of $75 million and $200 million,
    respectively. If CIPS or CILCO elect to transfer borrowing
    authority from the 2006 $500 million credit facility to the
    2007 $500 million credit facility, that company must retire
    an appropriate amount of first mortgage bonds issued with
    respect to the 2006 $500 million credit facility and issue
    new bonds in an equal amount to secure its obligations under the
    2007 $500 million credit facility. In July 2007, CILCO
    permanently reduced its $150 million of borrowing authority
    under the 2006 $500 million credit facility by
    $75 million and shifted that amount of capacity to the 2007
    $500 million credit facility. CILCO is now considered a
    borrower under both credit facilities and is subject to the
    covenants of both. The obligations of CILCORP under both the
    2006 $500 million credit facility and the 2007
    $500 million credit facility are secured by a pledge of the
    common stock of CILCO. The obligations of AERG under both the
    2006 $500 million credit facility and the 2007
    $500 million credit facility are secured by a mortgage and
    security interest in its E.D. Edwards and Duck Creek power
    plants and related licenses, permits, and similar rights.

The $1.15 billion credit facility is used to support the
    commercial paper programs of Ameren and UE. Access to the
    $1.15 billion credit facility, the 2006 $500 million
    credit facility, and the 2007 $500 million credit facility
    for the Ameren Companies is subject to reduction as borrowings
    are made by affiliates. Ameren and UE are currently limited in
    their access to the commercial paper market as a result of
    downgrades in their short-term credit ratings.

Indebtedness
    Provisions and Other Covenants

The Ameren Companies’ bank credit facilities contain
    provisions that, among other things, place restrictions on the
    ability to incur liens, sell assets, and merge with other
    entities. The $1.15 billion credit facility contains
    provisions that limit total indebtedness of each of Ameren, UE
    and Genco to 65% of total consolidated capitalization pursuant
    to a calculation defined in the facility. Exceeding these debt
    levels would result in a default under the $1.15 billion
    credit facility.

The $1.15 billion credit facility also contains provisions
    for default, including cross-defaults, with respect to a
    borrower. Defaults can result from an event of default under any
    other facility covering indebtedness of that borrower or certain
    of its subsidiaries in excess of $50 million in the
    aggregate. The obligations of Ameren, UE and Genco under the
    facility are several and not joint, and except under limited
    circumstances, the obligations of UE and Genco are not
    guaranteed by Ameren or any other subsidiary. CIPS, CILCORP,
    CILCO, AERG and IP are not considered subsidiaries for purposes
    of the cross-default or other provisions.

Under the $1.15 billion credit facility, restrictions apply
    limiting investments in and other transfers to CIPS, CILCORP,
    CILCO, IP, AERG and their subsidiaries by Ameren and certain
    subsidiaries. Additionally, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP, AERG and
    their subsidiaries are excluded for purposes of determining
    compliance with the 65% total consolidated indebtedness to total
    consolidated capitalization financial covenant in the facility.



Both the 2006 $500 million credit facility and the 2007
    $500 million credit facility entered into by CIPS, CILCORP,
    CILCO, IP and AERG, limit the indebtedness of each borrower to
    65% of consolidated total capitalization pursuant to a
    calculation set forth in the facilities. Events of default under
    these facilities apply separately to each borrower (and, except
    in the case of CILCORP, to their subsidiaries), and an event of
    default under these facilities does not constitute an event of
    default under the $1.15 billion credit facility and vice
    versa. In addition, if CIPS’, CILCO’s or IP’s
    senior secured long-term debt securities or first mortgage
    bonds, or CILCORP’s senior unsecured long-term debt
    securities, have received a below-investment-grade credit rating
    by either Moody’s or S&P, then each such borrower will
    be limited to capital stock dividend payments of
    $10 million per year while such below-investment-grade
    credit rating is in effect. On July 26, 2006, Moody’s
    downgraded CILCORP’s senior unsecured long-term debt credit
    rating to below investment-grade, causing it to be subject to
    this dividend payment limitation. No similar restriction applies
    to AERG, which is currently not rated by Moody’s or
    S&P, if its debt-to-operating cash flow ratio, as set forth
    in these facilities, is less than or equal to a 3.0 to 1.0
    ratio. As of December 31, 2007, AERG was in compliance with
    this test in the 2006 $500 million credit facility and the
    2007 $500 million credit facility. CIPS, CILCO and IP are
    not currently limited in their dividend payments by this
    provision of the 2006 $500 million or 2007
    $500 million credit facilities. Ameren’s access to
    dividends from CILCO and AERG would be limited by dividend
    restrictions at CILCORP.

The 2007 $500 million credit facility and the 2006
    $500 million credit facility also limit the amount of other
    secured indebtedness issuable by each borrower. For CIPS, CILCO
    and IP, other secured debt is limited to that permitted under
    their respective mortgage indentures. For CILCORP, other debt
    secured by the pledge of CILCO common stock is limited
    (a) under the 2007 $500 million credit facility to
    $425 million (in addition to the principal amount of
    CILCORP’s outstanding senior notes and senior bonds and its
    obligations under the 2006 $500 million credit facility)
    and (b) under the 2006 $500 million credit facility to
    $500 million (including the principal amount of
    CILCORP’s outstanding senior notes and senior bonds and
    amounts drawn on the 2007 $500 million credit facility).
    For AERG, other debt secured on an equal basis with its
    obligations under the facilities is limited to $100 million
    by the 2007 $500 million credit facility (excluding amounts
    drawn by AERG under the 2006 $500 million credit facility)
    and $200 million by the 2006 $500 million credit
    facility. The limitations on other secured debt at CILCORP and
    AERG in the 2007 $500 million credit facility are subject
    to adjustment based on the borrowing sublimits of these entities
    under this facility or under the 2006 $500 million credit
    facility. In addition, the 2007 $500 million credit
    facility and the 2006 $500 million credit facility prohibit
    CILCO from issuing any preferred stock if, after giving effect
    to such issuance, the aggregate liquidation value of all CILCO
    preferred stock issued after February 9, 2007, and
    July 14, 2006, respectively, would exceed $50 million.

The 2007 $500 million credit facility provides that CIPS,
    CILCO and IP will agree to reserve future bonding capacity under
    their respective mortgage indentures (that is, they agree to
    forgo the issuance of additional mortgage bonds otherwise
    permitted under the terms of each mortgage indenture) in the
    following amounts (subject to, in the case of CIPS and CILCO,
    their then current borrowing sublimits under the facility and
    similar provisions in the 2006 facility): CIPS, prior to
    December 31, 2007 – $50 million, on and
    after December 31, 2007, but prior to December 31,
    2008 – $100 million, on and after
    December 31, 2008, but prior to December 31,
    2009 – $150 million, on and after
    December 31, 2009 – $200 million; CILCO,
    prior to December 31, 2007 – $25 million, on
    and after December 31, 2007, but prior to December 31,
    2008 – $50 million, on and after
    December 31, 2008, but prior to December 31,
    2009 – $75 million, on and after
    December 31, 2009 – $150 million; and IP,
    prior to December 31, 2008 – $100 million,
    on and after December 31, 2008, but prior to
    December 31, 2009 – $200 million, on and
    after December 31, 2009 – $350 million.

The 2006 $500 million credit facility provides that CIPS,
    CILCO and IP will agree to reserve future bonding capacity under
    their respective mortgage indentures in the following amounts:
    CIPS, prior to December 31, 2007 –
    $50 million, on and after December 31, 2007, but prior
    to December 31, 2008 – $100 million, on and
    after December 31, 2008 – $150 million;
    CILCO – $25 million; and IP –
    $100 million.

Pursuant to a waiver dated November 16, 2007, CIPS was
    granted relief from complying with the covenant contained in the
    2006 and 2007 credit agreements requiring CIPS to reserve future
    bonding capacity under its mortgage indenture as discussed
    above. The waiver is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2007, the ratios of total indebtedness
    to total consolidated capitalization, calculated in accordance
    with the provisions of the $1.15 billion credit facility
    for Ameren, UE and Genco were 52%, 47% and 46%, respectively.
    The ratios for CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG, calculated in
    accordance with the provisions of the 2006 $500 million
    credit facility and the 2007 $500 million credit facility,
    were 54%, 58%, 45%, 49% and 39%, respectively.

None of Ameren’s credit facilities or financing
    arrangements contain credit rating triggers that would cause an
    event of default or acceleration of repayment of outstanding
    balances. At December 31, 2007, the Ameren Companies were
    in compliance with their credit facility provisions and
    covenants.

Money
    Pools

Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries
    to coordinate and provide for certain short-term cash and
    working capital requirements. Separate money pools are
    maintained for utility and non-state-regulated entities. Ameren
    Services is responsible for operation and administration of the
    money pool agreements.



Utility

Through the utility money pool, the pool participants may access
    the committed credit facilities. CIPS, CILCO and IP borrow from
    each other through the utility money pool agreement subject to
    applicable regulatory short-term borrowing authorizations.
    Although UE and Ameren Services are parties to the utility money
    pool agreement, they are not currently borrowing or lending
    under the agreement. Ameren Services administers the utility
    money pool and tracks internal and external funds separately.
    Ameren and AERG may participate in the utility money pool only
    as lenders. Internal funds are surplus funds contributed to the
    utility money pool from participants. The primary source of
    external funds for the utility money pool is the 2006
    $500 million and the 2007 $500 million credit
    facilities. The total amount available to the pool participants
    from the utility money pool at any given time is reduced by the
    amount of borrowings by their affiliates, but increased to the
    extent that the pool participants have surplus funds or remit
    funds from other external sources. The availability of funds is
    also determined by funding requirement limits established by
    regulatory authorizations. CIPS, CILCO and IP rely on the
    utility money pool to coordinate and provide for certain
    short-term cash and working capital requirements. Borrowers
    receiving a loan under the utility money pool agreement must
    repay the principal amount of such loan, together with accrued
    interest. The rate of interest depends on the composition of
    internal and external funds in the utility money pool. The
    average interest rate for borrowing under the utility money pool
    for the year ended December 31, 2007, was 5.80%
    (2006 – 5.03%).

Non-state-regulated
    Subsidiaries

Ameren Services, Resources Company, Genco, AERG, Marketing
    Company, AFS, and other non-state-regulated Ameren subsidiaries
    have the ability, subject to Ameren parent company authorization
    and applicable regulatory short-term borrowing authorizations,
    to access funding from Ameren’s $1.15 billion credit
    facility through a non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool
    agreement. The total amount available to the pool participants
    at any time is reduced by borrowings from Ameren made by its
    subsidiaries and is increased to the extent that other pool
    participants advance surplus funds to the non-state-regulated
    subsidiary money pool or remit funds from other external
    sources. At December 31, 2007, $409 million was
    available through the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool,
    excluding additional funds available through excess cash
    balances. The non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool was
    established to coordinate and to provide for short-term cash and
    working capital requirements of Ameren’s
    non-state-regulated activities. It is administered by Ameren
    Services. Borrowers receiving a loan under the
    non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool agreement must repay
    the principal amount of such loan, together with accrued
    interest. The rate of interest depends on the composition of
    internal and external funds in the non-state-regulated
    subsidiary money pool. These rates are based on the cost of
    funds used for money pool advances. Ameren and CILCORP are
    authorized to act only as lenders to the non-state-regulated
    subsidiary money pool. The average interest rate for borrowing
    under the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 was 5.14% (2006 – 4.65%).

See Note 12 – Related Party Transactions for the
    amount of interest income and expense from the money pool
    arrangements recorded by the Ameren Companies for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005.

In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement exists between
    Ameren, IP, and Ameren Services, which enables IP to make
    short-term borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount
    of borrowings outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral
    borrowing agreement and the utility money pool agreement,
    together with any outstanding external short-term borrowings by
    IP, may not exceed $500 million, pursuant to authorization
    from the ICC. IP is not currently borrowing under the unilateral
    borrowing agreement. Ameren Services is responsible for
    operation and administration of the agreements.

All of the Ameren Companies expect to fund maturities of

    through a combination of cash flow from operations and external
    financing. See Note 4 – Credit Facilities and
    Liquidity for a discussion of external financing availability.

Ameren

In June 2004, the SEC declared effective a

Form S-3

shelf registration statement filed by Ameren and its subsidiary
    trusts covering the offering from time to time of up to
    $2 billion of various types of securities, including
    long-term debt, trust preferred securities, and equity
    securities.

Ameren’s acquisitions of CILCORP and IP resulted in fair
    value adjustments to long-term debt of $111 million and
    $195 million, respectively. The fair value adjustments are
    being amortized to interest expense over the remaining life or
    to the expected redemption date of each debt issuance. As of
    December 31, 2007, the remaining unamortized balance of the
    fair market value adjustments for CILCORP and IP were
    $55 million and $20 million, respectively.

In March 2004, the SEC declared effective a

Form S-3

registration statement filed by Ameren, authorizing the offering
    of 6 million additional shares of its common stock under
    DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are, at
    Ameren’s option, newly issued shares or treasury shares, or
    shares purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated
    transactions. Ameren is currently selling newly issued shares of
    its common stock under DRPlus. Ameren is also selling newly
    issued shares of common stock under its 401(k) plan pursuant to
    an effective SEC

Form S-8

registration statement. Under DRPlus and its 401(k) plan
    (including subsidiary-related plans that are now merged into the
    Ameren 401(k) plan), Ameren issued 1.7 million,
    1.9 million, and 2.1 million shares of common stock in
    2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, which were valued at
    $91 million, $96 million, and $109 million for
    the respective years.

In December 2006, Ameren terminated interest rate swap
    transactions that were entered into in March 2002 to effectively
    convert its 5.70% fixed-rate notes to variable rate.

In February 2007, $100 million of Ameren’s
    5.70% notes matured and were retired.

In May 2007, $250 million of Ameren’s senior notes
    matured and were retired.

UE

In March 2006, following the receipt of all required regulatory
    approvals, UE completed the purchase of a 640-megawatt CT
    facility located in Audrain County, Missouri. As part of this
    transaction, UE was assigned the rights of NRG as lessee of the
    CT facility under a long-term lease with Audrain County, and UE
    assumed NRG’s obligations under the lease. UE as the lessee
    is responsible for rental payments under the lease in an amount
    sufficient to service the debt of a taxable industrial
    development revenue bond (principal amount of $240 million
    outstanding as of December 31, 2007) issued to NRG by
    Audrain County in exchange for title to the NRG CT facility. As
    part of this



acquisition, UE acquired the bond from NRG. Because rental
    payments are equal to debt service on the bond, there is no net
    cash expense relating to this lease. No capital was initially
    raised in the leasing transaction, and no capital was raised as
    a result of UE’s assumption of NRG’s lease obligations.

In June 2007, UE issued, pursuant to its October 2005 SEC

Form S-3

shelf registration statement, $425 million of
    6.40% senior secured notes due June 15, 2017, with
    interest payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of
    each year, beginning in December 2007. UE received net proceeds
    of $421 million, which were used to repay short-term debt.

In connection with UE’s June 2007 issuance of
    $425 million of senior secured notes, UE agreed, for so
    long as those senior secured notes are outstanding, that it will
    not, prior to June 15, 2012, optionally redeem, purchase or
    otherwise retire in full its outstanding first mortgage bonds
    not subject to release provisions, thus causing a first mortgage
    bond release date to occur. Such release date is the date at
    which the security provided by the pledge under UE’s first
    mortgage indenture would no longer be available to holders of
    any outstanding series of its senior secured notes and such
    indebtedness would become senior unsecured indebtedness ranking
    equally with any other outstanding senior unsecured indebtedness
    of UE. UE further agreed that the interest rate for these
    $425 million of senior secured notes will be subject to an
    increase of up to a maximum of 2.00% if such release date occurs
    between June 15, 2012, and June 15, 2017 (the maturity
    date of the $425 million senior secured notes), and if
    Moody’s or S&P downgrades the rating assigned to these
    senior secured notes below investment grade as a result of the
    release within 30 days of such release (subject to
    extension if and for so long as the rating for such senior
    secured notes is under consideration for possible downgrade).
    Any interest rate increase on these senior secured notes will
    take effect on the first day of the interest period during which
    such rating downgrade requires an increase in the interest rate.

CIPS

In June 2006, CIPS issued and sold, pursuant to an effective SEC

Form S-3

registration statement, $61 million of 6.70% senior
    secured notes due June 15, 2036, with interest payable
    semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year,
    beginning in December 2006. These notes are secured by first
    mortgage bonds, which are subject to fallaway provisions, as
    defined in the related financing agreements. CIPS received net
    proceeds of $60 million, which were used, along with other
    funds, to repay in full CIPS’ intercompany note payable to
    UE.

Also in June 2006, $20 million of CIPS’ 7.05% first
    mortgage bonds matured and were retired.

In December 2006, CIPS repurchased all $17 million of its

Series B-1

Illinois Finance Authority bonds pursuant to a mandatory tender.
    Interest payments are being made monthly by CIPS. The receivable
    for this repurchased bond is in Other Current Assets on
    CIPS’ balance sheet.

See Note 4 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity
    regarding CIPS agreement under the 2007 $500 million credit
    facility and the 2006 $500 million credit facility to
    reserve future bonding capacity under the mortgage. As a result
    of restrictions in the 2007 and 2006 $500 million credit
    facilities, CIPS can only issue first mortgage bonds based upon
    retired bond capacity of $3 million and/or to refinance
    first mortgage bonds currently outstanding.

CILCORP

As discussed above, in conjunction with Ameren’s
    acquisition of CILCORP, CILCORP’s long-term debt was
    increased to fair value by $111 million. Amortization
    related to fair value adjustments was $6 million,
    $6 million, and $7 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, and costs
    related to repayments were $- million, $2 million, and
    $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006, and 2005, respectively. These amounts were included in
    interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income of
    Ameren and CILCORP.

In March 2006, CILCORP repurchased $2 million in principal
    amount of its 9.375% senior bonds due 2029, and in April
    2006, CILCORP repurchased an additional $7 million in
    principal amount of these bonds.

See Note 4 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity
    regarding CILCORP’s pledge of the common stock of CILCO as
    security for its obligations under the 2006 $500 million
    credit facility and the 2007 $500 million credit facility.

CILCO

In each of July 2007, July 2006, and July 2005, CILCO redeemed
    11,000 shares of its 5.85% Class A preferred stock at
    a redemption price of $100 per share plus accrued and unpaid
    dividends. These redemptions satisfied CILCO’s mandatory
    sinking fund redemption requirement for this series of preferred
    stock for each year.

In January 2007, $50 million of CILCO’s 7.50% first
    mortgage bonds matured and were retired.

In June 2006, CILCO issued and sold, with registration rights in
    a private placement, $54 million of 6.20% senior
    secured notes due June 15, 2016, and $42 million of
    6.70% senior secured notes due June 15, 2036, both
    with interest payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15
    of each year, beginning in December 2006. These notes are
    secured by first mortgage bonds, which are subject to fallaway
    provisions as defined in the related financing agreements. CILCO
    received total net proceeds of $94 million, which were used
    to reduce short-term money pool borrowings and, in July 2006, to
    redeem CILCO’s $20 million 7.73% secured medium-term
    notes due 2025. CILCO exchanged the outstanding unregistered
    senior secured notes for registered secured notes on
    November 16, 2006.

See Note 4 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity
    regarding CILCO’s agreement under the 2007
    $500 million credit facility and the 2006 $500 million
    credit facility to reserve future bonding capacity under its
    mortgage and regarding the mortgage and security interest in its
    power plants issued



by AERG as security for its obligations under the 2006
    $500 million credit facility and the 2007 $500 million
    credit facility.

IP

As discussed above, in conjunction with Ameren’s
    acquisition of IP, IP’s long-term debt was increased to
    fair value by $195 million. Amortization related to fair
    value adjustments was $12 million, $13 million, and
    $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006, and 2005, respectively, and was included in interest
    expense in the consolidated statements of income of Ameren and
    IP.

In June 2006, IP issued and sold, with registration rights in a
    private placement, $75 million of 6.25% senior secured
    notes due June 15, 2016, with interest payable
    semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning
    in December 2006. These notes are secured by mortgage bonds,
    which are subject to fallaway provisions as defined in the
    related financing agreements. IP received net proceeds of
    $74 million, which were used to reduce short-term money
    pool borrowings. IP exchanged the outstanding unregistered
    senior secured notes for registered secured notes on
    November 16, 2006.

In November 2007, IP issued and sold, with registration rights
    in a private placement, $250 million of 6.125% senior
    secured notes due November 15, 2017, with interest payable
    semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning
    May 15, 2008. These notes are secured by mortgage bonds,
    which are subject to fallaway provisions as defined in the
    related financing agreements. IP received net proceeds of
    $248 million, which were used to repay short-term debt.

See Note 4 – Credit Facilities and Liquidity
    regarding IP’s agreement under the 2007 $500 million
    credit facility and the 2006 $500 million credit facility
    to reserve future bonding capacity under its mortgage indenture.

In December 1998, the IP SPT issued $864 million of TFNs,
    as allowed under the Illinois Electric Utility Transition
    Funding Law. In accordance with the Transitional Funding
    Securitization Financing Agreement, IP must designate a portion
    of the cash received from customer billings to fund payment of
    the TFNs. The amounts received are remitted to the IP SPT and
    are restricted for the sole purpose of paying down the TFNs. Due
    to the adoption of FIN No. 46R and resulting
    deconsolidation of IP SPT, restricted cash associated with
    amounts collected is netted against the current portion of
    IP’s long-term debt payable to IP SPT on IP’s
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, consolidated balance sheets.

Indenture
    Provisions and Other Covenants

UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s indenture
    provisions and articles of incorporation include covenants and
    provisions related to the issuances of first mortgage bonds and
    preferred stock. The following table includes the required and
    actual earnings coverage ratios for interest charges and
    preferred dividends and bonds and preferred stock issuable for
    the 12 months ended December 31, 2007, at an assumed

UE’s mortgage indenture contains certain provisions that
    restrict the amount of common dividends that can be paid by UE.
    Under this mortgage indenture, $31 million of total
    retained earnings was restricted against payment of common
    dividends, except those dividends payable in common stock, which
    left $1.8 billion of free and unrestricted retained
    earnings at December 31, 2007.

The IP SPT TFNs contain restrictions that prohibit IP LLC from
    making any loan or advance to, or certain investments in, any
    other person. Also, as long as the TFNs are outstanding, the IP
    SPT shall not, directly or indirectly,



pay any dividend or make any distribution (by reduction of
    capital or otherwise) to any owner of a beneficial interest in
    the IP SPT.

Genco’s and CILCORP’s indentures include provisions
    that require the companies to maintain certain debt service
    coverage and debt-to-capital ratios in order for the companies
    to pay dividends, to make certain principal or interest
    payments, to make certain loans to affiliates, or to incur
    additional indebtedness. The following table summarizes these
    ratios for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007:

Genco’s ratio restrictions under its indenture may be
    disregarded if both Moody’s and S&P reaffirm the
    ratings of Genco in place at the time of the debt incurrence
    after considering the additional indebtedness. In the event
    CILCORP is not in compliance with these tests, CILCORP may make
    payments of dividends or intercompany loans if its senior
    long-term debt rating is at least BB+ from S&P, Baa2 from
    Moody’s, and BBB from Fitch. At December 31, 2007,
    CILCORP’s senior long-term debt ratings from S&P,
    Moody’s and Fitch were B+, Ba2, and BB+, respectively. The
    common stock of CILCO is pledged as security to the holders of
    CILCORP’s senior notes and bonds and credit facility
    obligations.

In order for the Ameren Companies to issue securities in the
    future, they will have to comply with any applicable tests in
    effect at the time of any such issuances.

Off-Balance-Sheet
    Arrangements

At December 31, 2007, none of the Ameren Companies had any
    off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, other than operating
    leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. None of
    the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant
    off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in the near future.

NOTE 7 –

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in
    market prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity, and emission
    allowances. Price fluctuations in natural gas, fuel, and
    electricity cause any of the following:

•

an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted
    commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sale prices
    under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices;

•

market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased
    power that differ from the cost of those commodities in
    inventory; or

•

actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that
    differ from anticipated cash outlays.

The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by
    our risk management policies for forward contracts, futures,
    options, and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed
    within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new
    or offsetting transactions are required. The goal of the hedging
    program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring
    that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements.

Certain derivative contracts are entered into on a regular basis
    as part of our risk management program but do not qualify for
    hedge accounting or the normal purchase and sales exceptions
    under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended.

Accordingly, such contracts are recorded at fair value with
    changes in the fair value charged or credited to the



income statement in the period in which the change occurred.
    Contracts we enter into as part of our risk management program
    may be settled financially, by physical delivery, or net settled
    with the counterparty.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

Our risk management processes identify the relationships between
    hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk
    management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
    transactions. The mark-to-market value of cash flow hedges will
    continue to fluctuate with changes in market prices up to
    contract expiration.

We monitor and value derivative positions daily as part of our
    risk management processes. We use published sources for pricing
    when possible to mark positions to market. We rely on modeled
    valuations only when no other method exists.

The following table presents the pretax net gain (loss) for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, of power
    hedges included in Operating Revenues – Electric. This
    pretax net gain (loss) represents the impact of discontinued
    cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges,

As part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities entered into financial contracts with
    Marketing Company. These financial contracts are derivative
    instruments being accounted for as cash flow hedges at the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities and Marketing Company. Consequently,
    the Ameren Illinois Utilities and Marketing Company record the
    fair value of the contracts on their respective balance sheets
    and the changes to the fair value in regulatory assets or
    liabilities for the Ameren Illinois Utilities and OCI at
    Marketing Company. In Ameren’s consolidated financial
    statements, all financial statement effects of the swap are
    eliminated. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory
    Matters for additional information on these financial contracts.

Other
    Derivatives

The following table represents the net change in market value
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, of
    option and swap transactions used to manage our positions in
    SO


allowances, coal, heating oil, and power. Certain of these
    transactions are treated as nonhedge transactions under
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. The net
    change in the market value of power options is recorded in
    Operating Revenues – Electric, while the net changes
    in the market value of coal, heating oil, and
    SO


options and swaps is recorded as Operating Expenses

Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO
    and IP have been granted FTRs associated with the MISO Day Two
    Energy Market. Marketing Company has acquired FTRs for its
    participation in the PJM-Northern Illinois portion of the
    market. The FTRs are intended to hedge electric transmission
    congestion charges related to our delivery of electricity.
    Depending on the congestion on the electric transmission grid
    and prices at various points on such grid, FTRs could result in
    either charges or credits. We use complex grid modeling tools to
    determine which FTRs we wish to nominate in the FTR allocation
    process. There is a risk that we may incorrectly model the
    amount of FTRs we need, and there is the potential that some of
    the FTR hedges could be ineffective. FTRs are considered
    derivatives. As of December 31, 2007, the net value of FTRs
    held by the Ameren Companies was determined to be immaterial.

NOTE 8 –

STOCKHOLDER
    RIGHTS PLAN AND PREFERRED STOCK

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

Ameren’s board of directors has adopted a share purchase
    rights plan designed to assure stockholders of fair and equal
    treatment in the event of a proposed takeover. The rights are
    exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15% or more of
    Ameren’s outstanding common stock or announces a tender
    offer that would result in ownership by a person or group of 15%
    or more of the Ameren common stock. Each right will entitle the
    holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a newly issued preferred
    share at an exercise price of $180. If a person or group
    acquires 15% or more of Ameren’s outstanding common stock,
    each right will entitle its holder (other than such person or
    members of such group) to purchase, at the right’s
    then-current exercise price, a number of Ameren’s common
    shares having a market value of twice such price. In addition,
    if Ameren is acquired in a merger or other business combination
    transaction after a person or group has acquired 15% or more of
    Ameren’s outstanding common stock, each right will entitle
    its holder to purchase, at the right’s then-current
    exercise price, a number of the acquiring company’s common
    shares having a market value of twice such price. The acquiring
    person or group will not be entitled to exercise these rights.
    These rights expire in October 2008. One right will accompany
    each new share of Ameren common stock prior to such expiration
    date.

Preferred
    Stock

All classes of UE’s, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s
    preferred stock are entitled to cumulative dividends and have
    voting rights. Ameren has 100 million shares of
    $0.01 par value preferred stock authorized, with no shares
    outstanding. CIPS has 2.6 million shares of no par value
    preferred stock authorized, with no shares outstanding. UE has
    7.5 million shares authorized of $1 par value
    preference stock and CILCO has 2 million shares authorized
    of no par value preference stock, with no such preference stock
    outstanding. IP has 5 million shares authorized of no par
    value serial preferred stock and 5 million shares
    authorized of no par value preference stock, with no such serial
    preferred stock and preference stock outstanding. No shares of
    preference stock have been issued by any of the Ameren Companies.

NOTE 9 –

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

We offer defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans
    covering substantially all employees of UE, CIPS, CILCORP,
    CILCO, IP, EEI and Ameren Services and certain employees of
    Resources Company and its subsidiaries, including Genco. Ameren
    uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and
    postretirement benefit plans.

We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),” effective
    December 31, 2006. SFAS No. 158 requires
    employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded positions
    of defined benefit postretirement plans, including pension
    plans, as an asset or liability in their balance sheets and to
    recognize as a component of OCI, net of tax, the gains or losses
    and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period
    but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit
    cost. Upon adoption, Ameren recorded the unfunded obligation of
    its defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. The
    unfunded obligation is the difference between the projected
    benefit obligation for defined benefit plans or accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligation for postretirement benefit
    plans and each plan’s assets. Ameren’s adoption of
    SFAS No. 158 resulted in increases (decreases) to
    Ameren’s, UE’s, CIPS’, Genco’s,
    CILCORP’s, CILCO’s and IP’s accrued pension and
    other postretirement benefits of $406 million,
    $234 million, $95 million, $36 million,
    ($51) million, $55 million and ($8) million,
    respectively. UE, CIPS and CILCO recorded regulatory assets of
    $270 million, $108 million and $63 million,
    respectively, based on the expected recovery of these costs from
    ratepayers. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 had no
    material impact on accumulated other comprehensive income at
    Ameren. CILCORP and IP recognized gains in accumulated other
    comprehensive income of $29 million and $5 million,
    respectively, net of taxes, as a result of
    SFAS No. 158 obligations being reduced from those
    previously recognized. Genco and CILCO recorded a charge to
    accumulated other comprehensive income of $25 million and
    $2 million, respectively, net of taxes.

Investment
    Strategy and Return on Asset Assumption

The primary objective of the Ameren retirement plan and
    postretirement benefit plans is to provide eligible employees
    with pension and postretirement health care benefits. Ameren
    manages plan assets in accordance with the “prudent
    investor” guidelines contained in ERISA. Ameren’s goal
    is to earn the highest possible return on plan assets consistent
    with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates investment
    management to specialists in each asset class. Where
    appropriate, Ameren provides the investment manager with
    guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment
    types. Ameren regularly monitors manager performance and
    compliance with investment guidelines.

The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and
    projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes
    in the investment portfolio. Assumed projected rates of return
    for each asset class were selected after an analysis of
    historical experience, future expectations, and the volatility
    of the various asset classes. After considering the target asset
    allocation for each asset class, we adjusted the overall
    expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and
    expected experience of active portfolio management results
    compared to benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses
    paid from plan assets.

Pension benefits are based on the employees’ years of
    service and compensation. Ameren’s pension plans are funded
    in compliance with income tax regulations and federal funding
    requirements. In May 2007, the MoPSC issued an electric rate
    order for UE that allows UE to recover through customer rates
    pension expense incurred under GAAP. Ameren expects to fund its
    pension plans at a level equal to the pension expense. Based on
    Ameren’s assumptions at December 31, 2007, and
    reflecting this pension funding policy, Ameren expects annual
    contributions of $40 million to $65 million in each of
    the next five years. We expect UE’s, CIPS’,
    Genco’s, CILCO’s, and IP’s portion of the future
    funding requirements to be 65%, 8%, 11%, 5% and 11%,
    respectively. These amounts are estimates and may change with
    actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates, any
    pertinent changes in government regulations, and any voluntary
    contributions. Our policy for postretirement benefits is
    primarily to fund the Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association
    (VEBA) trusts to match the annual postretirement expense.

    the balance sheets of each of the Ameren Companies as of

None of the plan assets are expected to be returned to Ameren
    during 2008.

Downgrades of subprime U.S. mortgage-related assets have
    resulted in a decline in the fair value of

subprime-related

investments. The Ameren Companies have assessed their
    investments held in trusts related to Ameren’s pension and
    postretirement benefit plans and determined that direct exposure
    to subprime mortgages was not material.

Ameren’s current reconciliation of funded status shows
    certain amounts that will be recognized as a benefit cost in
    future years. The unrecognized loss in postretirement benefits
    is largely a result of declining discount rates over the past
    several years, higher than expected increases in medical costs,
    and market losses on plan assets.

The following table presents the cash contributions made to our
    defined benefit retirement plan qualified trusts and to our
    postretirement plans during 2007 and 2006.

Ameren determines the discount rate assumptions by utilizing an
    interest rate yield curve to make judgments pursuant to EITF

No. D-36,

“Selection of Discount Rates Used for Measuring Defined
    Benefit Pension Obligations and Obligations of Postretirement
    Benefit Plans Other Than Pensions.” The yield curve is
    based on the yields of more than 500 high-quality, noncallable
    corporate bonds with maturities between zero and 30 years.
    A theoretical spot-rate curve constructed from this yield curve
    is then used to discount the annual benefit cash flows of the
    Ameren pension plan and postretirement plans and to develop a
    single-point discount rate matching the plans’ payout
    structure.

In determining the current year market-related asset value, the
    prior year market-related value of assets is adjusted by
    contributions, disbursements, and expected return, plus 25% of
    the actual return in excess of (or less than) expected return
    for the four prior years.

    under the plan. The net actuarial loss subject to amortization
    is amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years.

    their share of the pension and postretirement costs. The

Ameren sponsors a 401(k) plan for eligible employees. The Ameren
    plan covered all eligible employees of the Ameren Companies at
    December 31, 2007, with the exception of CIPS employees
    represented by IBEW Local 702 who were covered by a separate
    401(k) plan until February 1, 2008. The CIPS-related 401(k)
    plan was merged into the Ameren plan effective February 1,
    2008. The plans allowed employees to contribute a portion of
    their base pay in accordance with specific guidelines. Ameren
    and CIPS matched a percentage of the employee contributions up
    to certain limits. Ameren’s matching contributions to the
    401(k) plan totaled $21 million, $19 million and
    $18 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    CIPS’ matching contributions to the CIPS-related 401(k)
    plan were less than $1 million annually in 2007, 2006 and
    2005.

The following table presents the portion of the 401(k) matching

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Ameren’s long-term incentive plan for eligible employees,
    called the Long-term Incentive Plan of 1998 (1998 Plan), was
    replaced prospectively by the 2006 Omnibus Incentive
    Compensation Plan (2006 Plan) effective May 2, 2006. The
    2006 Plan provides for a maximum of 4 million common shares
    to be available for grant to eligible employees and directors.
    No new awards may be granted under the 1998 Plan; however,
    previously granted awards continue to vest or to be exercisable
    in accordance with their



original terms and conditions. The 2006 Plan awards may be stock
    options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted
    stock units, performance shares, performance share units,
    cash-based awards, and other stock-based awards.

A summary of nonvested shares as of December 31, 2007, and
    changes during the year ended December 31, 2007, under the
    1998 Plan and the 2006 Plan is presented below:

    officers and other eligible employees in February 2007 under the
    2006 Plan.

(b)

Share units vested due to
    attainment of retirement eligibility by certain employees.
    Actual shares issued for retirement-eligible employees will vary
    depending on actual performance over the three-year measurement
    period.

Ameren recorded compensation expense of $18 million,
    $11 million, and $6 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, and a
    related tax benefit of $7 million, $4 million, and
    $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006, and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007,
    total compensation cost of $20 million related to nonvested
    awards not yet recognized is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of three years.

Performance Share
    Units

A share unit will vest and entitle an employee to receive shares
    of Ameren common stock (plus accumulated dividends) if, at the
    end of the three-year performance period, Ameren has achieved
    certain performance goals and the individual remains employed by
    Ameren. The exact number of shares issued pursuant to a share
    unit will vary from 0% to 200% of the target award, depending on
    actual company performance relative to the performance goals. If
    a share unit vests, Ameren will issue the related shares to the
    employee two years after vesting, but dividends on the shares
    will be paid to the employee at the same time they are paid to
    other shareholders.

The fair value of each share unit awarded in February 2007 under
    the 2006 Plan was determined to be $59.60, based on
    Ameren’s closing common share price of $53.99 per
    share at the grant date and lattice simulations used to estimate
    expected share payout based on Ameren’s attainment of
    certain financial measures relative to the designated peer
    group. The significant assumptions used to calculate fair value
    also included a three-year risk-free rate of 4.735%, dividend
    yields of 2.3% to 5.2% for the peer group, volatility of 12.91%
    to 18.33% for the peer group, and Ameren’s maintenance of
    its $2.54 annual dividend over the performance period.

The fair value of each share unit awarded in February 2006 under
    the 1998 Plan was determined to be $56.07, based on
    Ameren’s closing common share price of $50.69 per share at
    the grant date and lattice simulations used to estimate expected
    share payout based on Ameren’s attainment of certain
    financial measures relative to the designated peer group. The
    significant assumptions used to calculate fair value also
    included a three-year risk-free rate of 4.65%, dividend yields
    of 2.3% to 4.6% for the peer group, volatility of 13.87% to
    22.45% for the peer group, and Ameren’s maintenance of its
    $2.54 annual dividend over the performance period. The fair
    value of each share unit granted in May 2006 under the 2006 Plan
    was determined to be $56.07, according to assumptions similar to
    those applied to the February 2006 grant.

Restricted
    Stock

Restricted stock awards in Ameren common stock were granted
    under the 1998 Plan from 2001 to 2005. Restricted shares have
    the potential to vest over a seven-year period from the date of
    grant if the company achieves certain performance levels. An
    accelerated vesting provision included in this plan reduces the
    vesting period from seven years to three years if the earnings
    growth rate exceeds a prescribed level. During 2005, 154,086
    restricted stock awards were granted. The weighted-average fair
    value for restricted stock awards granted was $51.21 per share
    in 2005. We record compensation expense over the vesting period.

Stock
    Options

Ameren

Options in Ameren common stock were granted under the 1998 Plan
    at a price not less than the fair-market value of the common
    shares at the date of grant. Granted options vest over a period
    of five years, beginning at the date of grant, and they permit
    accelerated exercising upon the occurrence of certain events,
    including retirement. There have not been any stock options
    granted since December 31, 2000. Outstanding options of
    89,987 at December 31, 2007, expire on various dates
    through 2010. There is no expense



from stock options for the years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006, as all options granted were fully vested.

    $59 million, and $21 million, respectively. These will
    begin to expire in 2016.

FASB
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes – an Interpretation of
    SFAS No. 109

(FIN 48)

On January 1, 2007, the Ameren Companies adopted the
    provisions of FIN 48, which addresses the determination of
    whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax
    return should be recorded in the financial statements. The
    amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1, 2007,
    were $155 million, $58 million, $15 million,
    $36 million, $18 million, $18 million, and
    $12 million for Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO,
    and IP, respectively. These unrecognized tax benefits, if
    recognized, would have had the following impacts on the
    respective company’s tax rate: Ameren –
    $20 million, UE – $6 million,
    CIPS – less than $1 million, Genco –
    less than $1 million, CILCORP – less than
    $1 million, CILCO – less than $1 million,
    and IP – none.

A reconciliation of the change in the unrecognized tax benefit
    balance from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007, is
    as follows:

As of January 1, 2007, the Ameren Companies adopted a
    policy of recognizing interest and penalties accrued on tax
    liabilities on a gross basis as interest expense or
    miscellaneous expense in the statements of income. Prior to
    January 1, 2007, the Ameren Companies recognized such items
    in the provision for taxes on a net-of-tax basis. As of
    January 1, 2007, Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO,
    and IP had recorded liabilities of $12 million,
    $5 million, less than $1 million, $4 million,
    $1 million, less than $1 million, and less than
    $1 million, respectively, for the payment of interest with
    respect to unrecognized tax benefits and no amount for penalties
    with respect to unrecognized tax benefits.



A reconciliation of the change in the accrued interest balance
    from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007, is as
    follows:

As of December 31, 2007, the Ameren Companies have accrued
    no amount for penalties with respect to unrecognized tax
    benefits.

The Ameren Companies are no longer subject to U.S. federal
    income tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service for
    years before 2002. The Ameren Companies are currently under
    federal income tax return examination for years 2002 through
    2005. State income tax returns are generally subject to
    examination for a period of three years after filing. The state
    impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by
    various states for a period of up to one year after formal
    notification to the states. The Ameren Companies also do not now
    have material state income tax issues under examination,
    administrative appeals, or litigation.

It is reasonably possible that events will occur during the next
    12 months that would cause the total amount of unrecognized
    tax benefits for Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP
    to decrease by $28 million, $14 million, less than
    $1 million, $10 million, $4 million,
    $4 million and less than $ million, respectively;
    however, the Ameren Companies do not believe such decreases
    would be material to their results of operations.

NOTE 12 –

RELATED PARTY
    TRANSACTIONS

The Ameren Companies have engaged in, and may in the future
    engage in, affiliate transactions in the normal course of
    business. These transactions primarily consist of gas and power
    purchases and sales, services received or rendered, and
    borrowings and lendings. Transactions between affiliates are
    reported as intercompany transactions on their financial
    statements, but are eliminated in consolidation for
    Ameren’s financial statements. Below are the material
    related party agreements.

Illinois Electric
    Settlement Agreement

See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and
    Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies for
    information on the Illinois electric settlement agreement
    reached in July 2007 and reflected in legislation, enacted on
    August 28, 2007, that addresses electric rate increases and
    the future power procurement process in Illinois. As part of the
    Illinois electric settlement agreement, the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities, Genco and AERG agreed to make contributions of
    $150 million as part of a comprehensive program providing
    approximately $1 billion of funding for rate relief to
    certain Illinois electric customers, including customers of the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities. At December 31, 2007, CIPS,
    CILCO, and IP had receivable balances from Genco for
    reimbursement of customer rate relief of $2 million,
    $1 million, and $3 million, respectively. Also at
    December 31, 2007, CIPS, CILCO, and IP had receivable
    balances from AERG for reimbursement of customer rate relief of
    $1 million, $1 million, and $1 million,
    respectively. In addition, as part of the Illinois electric
    settlement agreement, the Ameren Illinois Utilities entered into
    financial contracts with Marketing Company to lock in energy
    prices for a portion of their around-the-clock power
    requirements from 2008 to 2012 at relevant market prices. These
    financial contracts became effective on August 28, 2007.
    See also Note 7 – Derivative Financial
    Instruments for additional information on the financial
    contracts.

Electric Power
    Supply Agreements

The following table presents the amount of gigawatthour sales
    under related party electric power supply agreements for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005:

Under two electric power supply agreements, which expired or
    terminated December 31, 2006, Genco was obliged to supply
    power to Marketing Company. Marketing Company, in turn, was
    obliged to supply to CIPS all of the



energy and capacity CIPS needed to offer service for resale to
    its native load customers at ICC-regulated rates and to fulfill
    its other obligations under all applicable federal and state
    tariffs or contracts. Any power not used by CIPS was sold by
    Marketing Company under various long-term wholesale and retail
    contracts.

In October 2003, AERG entered into an electric power supply
    agreement to supply CILCO with sufficient power to meet its
    native load requirements. Also, a bilateral power supply
    agreement was entered into between AERG and Marketing Company:
    AERG agreed to sell excess power to Marketing Company for sales
    outside the CILCO control area, and Marketing Company agreed to
    sell power to AERG to fulfill CILCO’s native load
    requirements. These agreements expired at the end of 2006.

In December 2006, Genco and Marketing Company entered into a new
    power supply agreement (Genco PSA) whereby Genco agreed to sell
    and Marketing Company to purchase all of the capacity available
    from Genco’s generation fleet and all the associated
    energy. The Genco PSA provides that Marketing Company shall pay,
    for each megawatthour of associated energy delivered by Genco
    and purchased by Marketing Company during the month of delivery,
    an “energy charge.” The “energy charge” is
    calculated by taking Marketing Company’s gross revenues
    with respect to power purchased from Genco and AERG in a
    particular month and subtracting the monthly capacity charge
    assessed on Marketing Company by Genco and AERG pursuant to the
    Genco PSA and the AERG PSA (as defined below), respectively.
    This produces the monthly net revenues. From the monthly net
    revenues, all administrative and general, transmission,
    purchased power, and other expenses are subtracted (excluding
    those expenses that do not support in whole or in part the gross
    revenue associated with Genco’s generation pursuant to the
    Genco PSA or AERG’s generation pursuant to the AERG PSA).
    This amount is then divided by the total number of megawatthours
    generated by Genco and AERG to determine the per megawatthour
    “energy charge.” The Genco PSA also provides that
    Marketing Company shall pay a “monthly capacity
    charge.” The formula for determining the “monthly
    capacity charge” is based on the monthly fixed cost of
    operating the generation fleet of Genco and AERG.

Also in December 2006, AERG and Marketing Company entered into a
    power supply agreement (AERG PSA) whereby AERG agreed to sell
    and Marketing Company to purchase all of the capacity available
    from AERG’s generation fleet and all the associated energy.
    The calculations of the energy charge and the monthly capacity
    charge under this agreement are substantively identical to those
    described above with respect to the Genco PSA. Both the Genco
    PSA and the AERG PSA commenced on January 1, 2007, and will
    continue through December 31, 2022, and from year to year
    thereafter unless either party elects to terminate the agreement
    by providing the other party with no less than six months
    advance written notice.

In accordance with a January 2006 ICC order, an auction was held
    in September 2006 to procure power for CIPS, CILCO and IP
    beginning January 1, 2007. Through the auction, Marketing
    Company contracted with CIPS, CILCO and IP to provide power for
    residential and small commercial customers (less than one
    megawatt of demand) as follows:

UE, CIPS, IP and a nonaffiliated company were parties to a
    power supply agreement with EEI to purchase and sell capacity
    and energy. This agreement expired on December 31, 2005.
    Under a separate agreement that also expired on
    December 31, 2005, CIPS resold its entitlements under the
    agreement with EEI to Marketing Company. Marketing Company and
    certain nonaffiliated companies were also parties to a power
    supply agreement with a subsidiary of EEI, to purchase capacity
    and energy. This agreement was terminated effective
    December 31, 2005. In December 2005, Marketing Company
    entered into a power supply agreement with EEI, effective
    January 2006, whereby EEI sells 100% of its capacity and energy
    to Marketing Company. This agreement expires on
    December 31, 2015.

UE had a 150-megawatt power supply agreement with Marketing
    Company that expired May 31, 2005. Power supplied by
    Marketing Company to UE through this agreement was obtained from
    Genco.

In December 2004, Marketing Company and IP entered into an
    agency agreement that authorized Marketing Company, on behalf of
    IP, to sell or purchase, as necessary, electric energy and
    capacity in the wholesale market for 2005 and 2006.



Interconnection
    and Transmission Agreements

UE, CIPS and IP are parties to an interconnection agreement
    for the use of their respective transmission lines and other
    facilities for the distribution of power. In addition, CILCO and
    IP, and CILCO and CIPS, are parties to similar interconnection
    agreements. These agreements have no contractual expiration
    date, but may be terminated by any party with three years’
    notice.

Joint Dispatch
    Agreement

Prior to December 31, 2006, UE and Genco jointly dispatched
    electric generation under a joint dispatch agreement among UE,
    CIPS and Genco. UE and Genco had the option to serve their load
    requirements from their own generation first, and then each
    could give its affiliates access to any available generation at
    incremental cost. Any excess generation not used by UE or Genco
    to serve load requirements was sold to third parties on a
    short-term basis. To allocate power costs between UE and Genco,
    an intercompany sale was recorded by the company sourcing the
    power to the other company. In January 2006, the allocation
    methodology in the JDA for margins on short-term sales of excess
    generation to third parties between UE and Genco was modified,
    and in July 2006, UE, CIPS and Genco mutually consented to waive
    the one-year termination notice requirement of the JDA. They
    agreed to terminate it on December 31, 2006.

The following table presents the amount of gigawatthour sales
    under the JDA.

Costs of support services provided by Ameren Services, AFS, and
    Ameren Energy Inc., until December 31, 2007, to their
    affiliates, including wages, employee benefits, professional
    services, and other expenses are based on, or are an allocation
    of, actual costs incurred.

Executory
    Tolling, Gas Sales, and Transportation Agreements

Under an executory tolling agreement, CILCO purchases steam,
    chilled water, and electricity from Medina Valley. In connection
    with this agreement, Medina Valley purchases gas to fuel its
    generating facility from AFS under a fuel supply and services
    agreement.

Under a gas transportation agreement, Genco acquires gas
    transportation service from UE for its Columbia, Missouri, CTs.
    This agreement expires in February 2016.

    Pools

See Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity Financings
    for discussion of affiliate borrowing arrangements.

Intercompany
    Promissory Notes

On May 1, 2005, Genco and CIPS amended the maturity date
    and interest rate of the subordinated note payable to CIPS. The
    note payable to CIPS was issued in conjunction with the transfer
    of CIPS’ electric generating assets and related liabilities
    to Genco. Genco issued to CIPS an amended and restated
    subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of
    $249 million with an interest rate of 7.125% per year, a
    five-year amortization schedule, and a maturity date of
    May 1, 2010. Interest income and expense for this note
    recorded by CIPS and Genco, respectively, was $10 million,
    $12 million, and $15 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Also on May 1, 2005, the remaining principal balance under
    Genco’s note payable to Ameren of $34 million was
    repaid. Genco recorded interest expense of $1 million from
    this note payable to Ameren for the year ended December 31,
    2005.

On May 2, 2005, CIPS issued to UE a subordinated promissory
    note in the principal amount of $67 million as
    consideration for 50% of UE’s Illinois-based utility assets
    transferred to CIPS on that date. The note bore interest of
    4.70% per year and had a five-year amortization schedule and a
    maturity date of May 2, 2010. In June 2006, CIPS repaid in
    full the remaining balance under this note. UE and CIPS recorded
    interest income and expense, respectively, of $1 million
    and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively.

CILCORP had outstanding borrowings directly from Ameren of
    $2 million and $73 million at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. The average interest rate on these
    borrowings was 5.14% for the year ended December 31, 2007
    (2006 – 4.65%). CILCORP recorded interest expense of
    $- million, $7 million, and $6 million for these
    borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005 respectively.

Operating
    Leases

Under an operating lease agreement, Genco leased certain CTs at
    a Joppa, Illinois, site to its former parent, Development
    Company, for an initial term of 15 years, expiring
    September 30, 2015. Genco recorded operating revenues from
    the lease agreement of $11 million, $11 million, and
    $10 million for the three years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Under an electric power
    supply agreement with Marketing Company,



Development Company supplied the capacity and energy from these
    leased units to Marketing Company, which in turn supplied the
    energy to Genco. By mutual agreement of the parties, this lease
    agreement and power supply agreement was terminated in February
    2008, when an internal reorganization merged Development Company
    into Resources Company.

The following table presents the impact on UE, CIPS, Genco,
    CILCORP, CILCO, and IP of related party transactions for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. It is based
    primarily on the agreements discussed above and the money pool
    arrangements discussed in Note 4 – Credit
    Facilities and Liquidity.

The Price-Anderson Act is a federal law that limits the
    liability for claims from an incident involving any licensed
    United States commercial nuclear power facility. The limit is
    based on the number of licensed reactors. The limit of liability
    and the maximum potential annual payments are adjusted at least
    every five years for inflation to reflect changes in the
    Consumer Price Index. Owners of a nuclear reactor cover this
    exposure through a combination of private insurance and
    mandatory participation in a financial protection pool, as
    established by Price-Anderson.

After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Nuclear
    Electric Insurance Ltd. confirmed that losses resulting from
    terrorist attacks would be covered under its policies. However,
    Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd. imposed an industry-wide
    aggregate policy limit of $3.24 billion within a

12-month

period for coverage for such terrorist acts.

If losses from a nuclear incident at the Callaway nuclear plant
    exceed the limits of, or are not subject to, insurance, or if
    coverage is unavailable, UE is at risk for any uninsured losses.
    If a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a
    material adverse effect on Ameren’s and UE’s results
    of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Commencing January 1, 2007, CIPS, CILCO and IP were
    required to obtain all electric supply requirements for
    customers who did not purchase electric supply from third-party
    suppliers in the Illinois reverse power procurement auction held
    in September 2006. As part of the Illinois electric settlement
    agreement, the reverse auction used for power procurement was
    discontinued and replaced with a new power procurement process
    to be led by the IPA, beginning in 2009. In 2008, utilities will
    contract for necessary power and energy requirements not already
    supplied through the September 2006 auction contracts, primary
    through a request-for-proposal process, subject to ICC review
    and approval. Existing supply contracts from the September 2006
    auction remain in place. See Note 2 – Rate and
    Regulatory Matters for additional information.

CIPS, CILCO and IP entered into power supply contracts with
    winning bidders of the Illinois power procurement auction held
    in September 2006. The power supply contracts stipulate terms of
    17 months, 29 months, and 41 months to serve the
    electric load requirements of fixed-price residential and small
    commercial customers (with less than one megawatt of demand)
    commencing January 1, 2007. CIPS, CILCO and IP obtained

17-month-term

electric power supply contracts with winning bidders in the
    auction to serve the load requirements of commercial and
    industrial fixed-price customers (with one megawatt or greater
    demand) commencing January 1, 2007. Under these contracts,
    the electric suppliers are responsible for providing to CIPS,
    CILCO and IP energy, capacity, certain transmission, volumetric
    risk management, and other services necessary for the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities to serve the load of customers at an
    all-inclusive fixed price.

Through the Illinois auction held in September 2006, CIPS, CILCO
    and IP contracted for their anticipated fixed-price loads for
    residential and small commercial customers (less than one
    megawatt of demand) as follows:

The Illinois electric settlement agreement provides
    approximately $1 billion of funding over a four-year period
    that commenced in 2007 for rate relief for certain electric
    customers in Illinois. Funding for the settlement will come from
    electric generators in Illinois and certain Illinois electric
    utilities. The Ameren Illinois Utilities, Genco and AERG agreed
    to fund an aggregate of $150 million, of which the
    following contributions remain to be made at December 31,
    2007:

Also as part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, the

    Marketing Company to lock-in energy prices for 400 to
    1,000 megawatts annually of their around-the-



clock power requirements from 2008 to 2012. See
    Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters for
    additional information.

At this time, UE does not expect to require new baseload
    generation capacity until 2018 to 2020. However, due to the
    significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and
    build a baseload power plant, UE is actively studying future
    plant alternatives, including those that would use coal or
    nuclear fuel. During the second quarter of 2007, UE entered into
    a commitment to purchase heavy forgings needed to construct a
    nuclear plant. This commitment does not mean a decision has been
    made to build a nuclear plant. The purpose of the purchase
    commitment was to secure access to heavy forgings, which are
    long-lead-time materials, in the event that UE decides to build
    a nuclear plant. As of December 31, 2007, UE’s
    commitments to purchase heavy forgings totaled
    $84.5 million through 2010 ($6.5 million in 2008,
    $7.5 million in 2009, and $70.5 million in 2010). They
    are included in the other obligations table above.

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations
    enforced by federal, state and local authorities. From the
    beginning phases of siting and development to the ongoing
    operation of existing or new electric generating, transmission
    and distribution facilities, natural gas storage plants, and
    natural gas transmission and distribution facilities, our
    activities involve compliance with diverse laws and regulations.
    These laws and regulations address noise, emissions, impacts to
    air and water, protected and cultural resources (such as
    wetlands, endangered species, and archeological and historical
    resources), and chemical and waste handling. Our activities
    often require complex and lengthy processes as we obtain
    approvals, permits or licenses for new, existing or modified
    facilities. Additionally, the use and handling of various
    chemicals or hazardous materials (including wastes) requires
    release prevention plans and emergency response procedures. As
    new laws or regulations are promulgated, we assess their
    applicability and implement the necessary modifications to our
    facilities or our operations. The more significant matters are
    discussed below.

Clean Air
    Act

The EPA issued final
    SO


,
    NO

x

and mercury emission regulations in May 2005. The Clean Air
    Interstate Rule and the Clean Air Mercury Rule require
    significant reductions in these emissions from UE, Genco, AERG
    and EEI power plants in phases, beginning in 2009. States have
    finalized rules to implement the federal Clean Air Interstate
    Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule. Although the federal rules
    mandate a specific cap for
    SO


,
    NO

x

and mercury emissions by state from utility boilers, the states
    have considerable flexibility in allocating emission allowances
    to individual utility boilers. In addition, a state may choose
    to hold back certain emission allowances for growth or other
    reasons, and it may implement a more stringent program than the
    federal program. Illinois has finalized rules to implement the
    federal Clean Air Interstate Rule program that will reduce the
    number of
    NO

x

allowances automatically allocated to Genco’s, AERG’s
    and EEI’s plants. As a result of the Illinois rules, Genco,
    AERG and EEI will need to procure allowances and install
    pollution control equipment. Current plans include the
    installation of scrubbers for
    SO


reduction and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems for
    NO

x

reduction at certain coal-fired plants in Illinois. Missouri
    rules, which substantially follow the federal regulations and
    became effective in April 2007, and approved by the EPA in
    December 2007, are expected to reduce mercury emissions 81% by
    2018, and
    NO

x

emissions 30% and
    SO


emissions 75% by 2015. As a result of the Missouri rules, UE
    will manage allowances and install pollution control equipment.
    Current plans include the installation of scrubbers for
    SO


reduction and co-benefit reduction of mercury and pollution
    control equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions at
    certain coal-fired plants in Missouri.

Illinois has adopted rules for mercury emissions that are
    significantly stricter than the federal regulations. In 2006,
    Genco, CILCO, EEI, and the Illinois EPA entered into an
    agreement that was incorporated into Illinois’ mercury
    emission regulations. Under the regulations, Illinois generators
    may defer until 2015 the requirement to reduce mercury emissions
    by 90% in exchange for accelerated installation of
    NO

x

and
    SO


controls. In 2009, Genco, AERG and EEI expect to begin putting
    into service equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions.
    These rules, when fully implemented, are expected to reduce
    mercury emissions 90%,
    NO

x

emissions 50%, and
    SO


emissions 70% by 2015 in Illinois.

In February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    District of Columbia issued a decision that effectively vacated
    the federal Clean Air Mercury Rule. The court ruled that the EPA
    erred in the method used to remove electric generating units
    from the list of sources subject to the maximum available
    control technology requirements under the Clean Air Act. The
    Court’s decision is subject to appeal and it is uncertain
    how the EPA will respond. At this time, we are unable to
    determine the impact that this action would have on our
    estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental rules,
    our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

The table below presents estimated capital costs based on
    current technology to comply with both the federal Clean Air
    Interstate Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule through 2017 and
    related state implementation plans. The estimates described
    below could change depending upon additional federal or state
    requirements, new technology, variations in costs of material or
    labor, or alternative compliance strategies, among other
    reasons. The timing of estimated capital costs may also be
    influenced by whether emission allowances are used to comply
    with the proposed rules, thereby deferring capital investment.

Illinois and Missouri must also develop attainment plans to meet
    the federal

eight-hour

ozone ambient standard, the federal fine particulate ambient
    standard, and the Clean Air Visibility rule. Both states have
    filed ozone attainment plans for the St. Louis area. The
    state attainment plans for fine particulate matter must be
    submitted to the EPA by April 2008. The plans for the Clean Air
    Visibility rule were submitted in December 2007. The costs in
    the table assume that emission controls required for the Clean
    Air Interstate Rule regulations will be sufficient to meet these
    new standards in the St. Louis region. Should Missouri
    develop an alternative plan to comply with these standards, the
    cost impact could be material to UE, but we would expect these
    costs to be recoverable from ratepayers. Illinois is planning to
    impose additional requirements beyond the Clean Air Interstate
    Rule as part of the attainment plans for ozone and fine
    particulate matter. At this time, we are unable to determine the
    impact such state actions would have on our results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity.

The impact of future initiatives related to greenhouse gas
    emissions and global warming on us are unknown and therefore not
    included in the estimated environmental expenditures. Although
    compliance costs are unlikely in the near future, our costs of
    complying with any mandated federal or state greenhouse gas
    program could have a material impact on our future results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Emission
    Allowances

Both federal and state laws require significant reductions in
    SO


and NOx emissions that result from burning fossil fuels. The
    Clean Air Act, under the Acid Rain Program and
    NO

x

Budget Trading Programs, created marketable commodities called
    allowances. Currently each allowance gives the owner the right
    to emit one ton of
    SO


or
    NO

x

.
    All existing generating facilities have been allocated
    allowances based on past production and the statutory emission
    reduction goals. If additional allowances are needed for new
    generating facilities, they can be purchased from facilities
    that have excess allowances or from allowance banks. Our
    generating facilities comply with the
    SO


limits through the use and purchase of allowances, through the
    use of low-sulfur fuels, and through the application of
    pollution control technology. The
    NO

x

Budget Trading Program limits emissions of
    NO

x

during the ozone season (May through September). The
    NO

x

Budget Trading Program has applied to all electric generating
    units in Illinois since the beginning of 2004; it was applied to
    the eastern third of Missouri, where UE’s coal-fired power
    plants are located, beginning in 2007. Our generating facilities
    are expected to comply with the
    NO

x

limits through the use and purchase of allowances or through the
    application of pollution control technology, including
    low-NO

x

burners, over-fire air systems, combustion optimization,
    rich-reagent injection, selective noncatalytic reduction, and
    selective catalytic reduction systems.

    SO


and

UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI expect to use a substantial

    SO


and
    NO

allowances for ongoing operations. Environmental regulations,
    including the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the timing of the
    installation of pollution control equipment, and the level of
    operations will have a significant impact on the amount of
    allowances actually required for ongoing operations. The Clean
    Air Interstate Rule requires a reduction in
    SO


emissions by increasing the ratio of Acid Rain Program
    allowances surrendered. The current Acid Rain Program requires
    the surrender of one
    SO


allowance for every ton of
    SO


that is emitted. The Clean Air Interstate Rule program will
    require that
    SO


allowances of vintages 2010 through 2014 be surrendered at a
    ratio of two allowances for every ton of emission.
    SO


allowances with vintages of 2015 and beyond will be required to
    be surrendered at a ratio of 2.86 allowances for every ton
    of emission. In order to accommodate this change in surrender
    ratio and to comply with the federal and state regulations, UE,
    Genco, AERG, and EEI expect to install control technology
    designed to further reduce
    SO


emissions, as discussed above.

The Clean Air Interstate Rule will have both an annual program
    and an ozone season program for regulating
    NO

x

emissions, with separate allowances issued for each program.
    Both sets of allowances for the years 2009 through 2014 were
    issued by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources in
    December 2007. Allocations for UE’s Missouri generating
    facilities were 11,665 tons per ozone season and 26,842 tons
    annually. Allocations for Genco’s generating facility in
    Missouri were one ton for the ozone season and three tons
    annually. UE, Genco, AERG and EEI expect to be allocated
    NO

x

allowances for both programs in Illinois in 2008.

Global
    Climate

Future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global
    warming are subject to active consideration in the
    U.S. Congress. Ameren believes that currently proposed
    legislation can be classified as moderate to extreme depending
    upon proposed
    CO


emission limits, the timing of implementation of these limits,
    and the method of allocating



allowances. The moderate scenarios include provisions for a
    “safety valve” that provides a ceiling price for
    emission allowance purchases. As a result of our diverse fuel
    portfolio, our contribution to greenhouse gases varies among our
    generating facilities, but coal-fired power plants are
    significant sources of carbon dioxide, a principal greenhouse
    gas. Ameren’s current analysis shows that under some policy
    scenarios being considered in Congress, household costs and
    rates for electricity could rise significantly. The burden could
    fall particularly hard on electricity consumers and the Midwest
    economy because of the region’s reliance on electricity
    generated by coal-fired power plants. When consumed natural gas
    emits about half the amount of
    CO


as coal. As a result, economy-wide shifts favoring natural gas
    as a fuel source for electric generation also would affect the
    cost of nonelectric transportation, heating for our customers
    and many industrial processes. Under some policy scenarios being
    considered by Congress, Ameren believes that wholesale natural
    gas costs could rise significantly as well. Higher costs for
    energy could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and
    natural gas.

Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate
    limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in
    significant increases in capital expenditures and operating
    costs. The costs to comply with future legislation or
    regulations could be so expensive that Ameren and other
    similarly situated electric power generators may be forced to
    close some coal-fired facilities. Mandatory limits could have a
    material adverse impact on Ameren’s, UE’s,
    Genco’s, AERG’s and EEI’s results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision
    that determined that the EPA has the authority to regulate
    carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from automobiles as
    “air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme
    Court sent the case back to the EPA, which must conduct a
    rulemaking process to determine whether greenhouse gas emissions
    contribute to climate change “which may reasonably be
    anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” As a
    result, the EPA could begin to regulate such emissions.

Ameren has taken actions to address the global climate issue.
    These include implementing efficiency improvements at our power
    plants; participating in the PowerTree Carbon Company, LLC,
    whose purpose is to reforest acreage in the lower Mississippi
    valley to sequester carbon; using coal combustion by-products as
    a direct replacement for cement, thereby reducing carbon
    emissions at cement kilns; participating in “Missouri
    Schools Going Solar,” a project that will install
    photovoltaic solar arrays on school grounds; and partnering with
    other utilities, the Electric Power Research Institute, and the
    Illinois State Geological Survey in the DOE Illinois Basin
    Initiative, which will examine the feasibility and methods of
    storing
    CO


within deep unused coal seams, mature oil fields, and saline
    reservoirs.

The impact on us of future initiatives related to greenhouse gas
    emissions and global warming is unknown. Although compliance
    costs are unlikely in the near future, our costs of complying
    with any mandated federal or state, where our Non-rate-regulated
    Generation coal-fired plants are located, greenhouse gas program
    could have a material impact on our future results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Clean Water
    Act

In July 2004, the EPA issued rules under the Clean Water Act
    that require cooling-water intake structures to have the best
    technology available for minimizing adverse environmental
    impacts on aquatic species. These rules pertain to all existing
    generating facilities that currently employ a cooling-water
    intake structure whose flow exceeds 50 million gallons per
    day. The rules may require us to install additional intake
    screens or other protective measures and to do extensive
    site-specific study and monitoring. There is also the
    possibility that the rules may lead to the installation of
    cooling towers on some of our facilities. On January 25,
    2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
    remanded many provisions of these rules to the EPA for revision.
    Until the EPA reissues these rules and the studies on the power
    plants are completed, we will be unable to estimate the costs of
    complying with these rules. Such costs are not expected to be
    incurred prior to 2010.

New Source
    Review

The EPA has been conducting an enforcement initiative to
    determine whether modifications at a number of coal-fired power
    plants owned by electric utilities in the United States are
    subject to New Source Review (NSR) requirements or New Source
    Performance Standards under the Clean Air Act. The EPA’s
    inquiries focus on whether the best available emission control
    technology was or should have been used at such power plants
    when major maintenance or capital improvements were performed.

In April 2005, Genco received a request from the EPA for
    information pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air Act
    seeking detailed operating and maintenance history data with
    respect to its Meredosia, Hutsonville, Coffeen and Newton
    facilities, EEI’s Joppa facility, and AERG’s
    E.D. Edwards and Duck Creek facilities. In December 2006,
    the EPA issued a second Section 114(a) request to Genco
    regarding projects at the Newton facility. All of these
    facilities are coal-fired power plants. We are currently in
    discussions with the EPA and the state of Illinois regarding
    resolution of these matters, but we are unable to predict the
    outcome of these discussions. Resolution of these matters could
    have a material adverse impact on the future results of
    operations, financial position or liquidity of Ameren, Genco,
    AERG and EEI. A resolution could result in increased capital
    expenditures, increased operations and maintenance expenses, and
    fines or penalties. We believe that any potential resolution
    would likely require the installation of control technology,
    some of which is already planned for compliance with other
    regulatory requirements such as the Clean Air Interstate Rule
    and the Illinois mercury rules.



Remediation

We are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up
    hazardous waste sites as required by federal and state law. Such
    statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation
    actions regardless of degree of fault, legality of original
    disposal, or ownership of a disposal site. UE, CIPS, CILCO and
    IP have each been identified by the federal or state governments
    as a potentially responsible party at several contaminated
    sites. Several of these sites involve facilities that were
    transferred by CIPS to Genco in May 2000 and facilities
    transferred by CILCO to AERG in October 2003. As part of each
    transfer, CIPS and CILCO have contractually agreed to indemnify
    Genco and AERG for remediation costs associated with preexisting
    environmental contamination at the transferred sites.

As of December 31, 2007, CIPS, CILCO and IP owned or were
    otherwise responsible for several former MGP sites in Illinois.
    CIPS has 14, CILCO four, and IP 25. All of these sites are
    in various stages of investigation, evaluation and remediation.
    Under its current schedule, Ameren anticipates that remediation
    at these sites should be completed by 2015. The ICC permits each
    company to recover remediation and litigation costs associated
    with its former MGP sites from its Illinois electric and natural
    gas utility customers through environmental adjustment rate
    riders. To be recoverable, such costs must be prudently and
    properly incurred, and costs are subject to annual
    reconciliation review by the ICC. As of December 31, 2007,
    estimated obligations were: CIPS – $24 million to
    $42 million, CILCO – $5 million to
    $8 million, IP – $76 million to
    $171 million. CIPS, CILCO and IP also recorded liabilities
    of $24 million, $5 million, and $76 million,
    respectively, to represent estimated minimum obligations as no
    other amount within the range is a better estimate at this time.

In addition, UE owns or is otherwise responsible for 10 MGP
    sites in Missouri and one in Iowa. UE does not currently have in
    effect in Missouri a rate rider mechanism that permits
    remediation costs associated with MGP sites to be recovered from
    utility customers. See Note 2 – Rate and
    Regulatory Matters for information on a Missouri law enabling
    the MoPSC to put in place environmental cost recovery mechanisms
    for Missouri utilities. UE does not have any retail utility
    operations in Iowa that would provide a source of recovery of
    these remediation costs. As of December 31, 2007, UE
    estimated its obligation at $5 million to $13 million.
    UE recorded $5 million to represent its estimated minimum
    obligation for its MGP sites as no other amount within the range
    is a better estimate at this time. UE also is responsible for
    four electric sites in Missouri that have corporate cleanup
    liability, most as a result of federal agency mandates. As of
    December 31, 2007, UE estimated its obligation at
    $4 million to $17 million. UE recorded $4 million
    to represent its estimated minimum obligation for these sites as
    no other amount within the range is a better estimate at this
    time. We are unable to determine what portion of these costs, if
    any, will be eligible for recovery from insurance carriers.

In June 2000, the EPA notified UE and numerous other companies,
    including Solutia, that former landfills and lagoons in Sauget,
    Illinois, may contain soil and groundwater contamination. These
    sites are known as Sauget Area 2. From about 1926 until
    1976, UE operated a power generating facility adjacent to Sauget
    Area 2. UE currently owns a parcel of property that was
    once used as a landfill. Under the terms of an Administrative
    Order and Consent, UE has joined with other potentially
    responsible parties (PRPs) to evaluate the extent of potential
    contamination with respect to Sauget Area 2.

Sauget Area 2 investigation activities under the oversight
    of the EPA are largely completed, and the results will be
    submitted to the EPA by the third quarter of 2008. Following
    this submission, the EPA will ultimately select a remedy
    alternative and begin negotiations with various PRPs to
    implement it. Over the last several years, numerous other
    parties have joined the PRP group and presumably will
    participate in the funding of any required remediation. In
    addition, Pharmacia Corporation and Monsanto Company have agreed
    to assume the liabilities related to Solutia’s former
    chemical waste landfill in the Sauget Area 2,
    notwithstanding Solutia’s filing for bankruptcy protection.

In December 2004, AERG submitted a comprehensive package to the
    Illinois EPA to address groundwater and surface water issues
    associated with the recycle pond, ash ponds, and reservoir at
    the Duck Creek power plant facility. Information submitted by
    AERG is currently under review by the Illinois EPA. CILCORP and
    CILCO both have a liability of $2 million at
    December 31, 2007, included on their Consolidated Balance
    Sheets for the estimated cost of the remediation effort, which
    involves treating and discharging recycle-system water in order
    to address these groundwater and surface water issues.

In addition, our operations, or those of our predecessor
    companies, involve the use, disposal of and, in appropriate
    circumstances, the cleanup of substances regulated under
    environmental protection laws. We are unable to determine the
    impact these actions may have on our results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

Polychlorinated
    Biphernals Information Request

Polychlorinated biphernals (PCBs) are a blend of chemical
    compounds that were historically used in a variety of industrial
    products because of their chemical and thermal stability. In
    natural gas systems, PCBs were used as a compressor lubricant
    and a valve sealant before their sale for these applications was
    banned by the EPA in 1979. During the third quarter of 2007, the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities received requests from the Illinois
    attorney general and the EPA for information regarding its
    experiences with PCBs in its gas distribution system. The Ameren
    Illinois Utilities have responded to these information requests.

The Ameren Illinois Utilities have evaluated their gas
    distribution systems. They believe that the presence of PCBs is
    limited to discrete areas and is not widespread throughout its
    service territories. We cannot predict whether any further
    actions will be required on the part of the Ameren Illinois



Utilities regarding this matter or what the ultimate outcome
    will be.

Pumped-storage
    Hydroelectric Facility Breach

In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at
    UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility. This
    resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which
    damaged a state park.

In October 2006, FERC approved a stipulation and consent
    agreement between UE and FERC’s Office of Enforcement that
    resolved all issues arising from an investigation conducted by
    FERC’s Office of Enforcement into alleged violations of
    license conditions and FERC regulations by UE, as the licensee
    of the Taum Sauk hydroelectric facility, that may have
    contributed to the breach of the upper reservoir. As part of the
    stipulation and consent agreement, UE paid a civil penalty of
    $10 million, paid $5 million into an interest-bearing
    escrow account to fund project enhancements at or near the Taum
    Sauk facility, and implemented a new dam safety program in
    connection with the settlement.

In February 2007, UE submitted to FERC an environmental report
    to rebuild the upper reservoir at its Taum Sauk plant. UE
    received approval from FERC to rebuild the upper reservoir at
    its Taum Sauk plant in August 2007 and hired a contractor in
    November 2007. The estimated cost to rebuild the upper reservoir
    is in the range of $450 million. UE expects the Taum Sauk
    plant to be out of service through at least the fall of 2009.

In December 2006, the state of Missouri, through its attorney
    general, and 10 business owners filed separate lawsuits
    regarding the Taum Sauk breach. The attorney general’s
    suit, which was filed in the Missouri Circuit Court of
    St. Louis and subsequently transferred to the Circuit Court
    of Reynolds County, alleged negligence, violations of the
    Missouri Clean Water Act, and various other statutory and common
    law claims. The business owners’ suit, which was filed in
    the Missouri Circuit Court of Reynolds County and remains
    pending, contains similar allegations and seeks damages relating
    to business losses, lost profit, and unspecified punitive
    damages.

In November 2007, UE entered into a settlement agreement with
    the state of Missouri represented by the Missouri Attorney
    General, the Missouri Conservation Commission and the Missouri
    Department of Natural Resources that resolved the state of
    Missouri’s lawsuit and claims for damages and other relief
    related to the December 2005 Taum Sauk breach. The
    $177 million settlement agreement included cash payments to
    various state funds. In addition, pursuant to the settlement
    agreement, UE is required to replace the breached upper
    reservoir at the Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric plant
    with a new upper reservoir, subject to authorization by FERC,
    which was received in August 2007. The Circuit Court of Reynolds
    County approved the settlement agreement through a consent
    judgment in January 2008.

As part of the settlement agreement, UE agreed that it will not
    attempt to recover from ratepayers in any future rate increase
    any in-kind or monetary payments to the state parties required
    by the settlement agreement or costs incurred in the
    reconstruction of the new upper reservoir (expressly excluding,
    however, enhancements, costs incurred due to circumstances or
    conditions that are currently not reasonably foreseeable and
    costs that would have been incurred absent the December 2005
    breach of the upper reservoir at UE’s Taum Sauk
    pumped-storage hydroelectric plant).

At this time, UE believes that substantially all damages and
    liabilities caused by the breach, including costs related to the
    settlement agreement with the state of Missouri, the cost of
    rebuilding the plant, and the cost of replacement power, up to
    $8 million annually, will be covered by insurance.
    Insurance will not cover lost electric margins and penalties
    paid to FERC. UE expects that the total cost for cleanup, damage
    and liabilities, excluding costs to rebuild the reservoir will
    range from $199 million to $219 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, UE had paid $96 million and accrued
    a $103 million liability, including costs resulting from
    the FERC-approved stipulation and consent agreement discussed
    above, while expensing $32 million and recording a
    $167 million receivable due from insurance companies. As of
    December 31, 2007, UE had received $89 million from
    insurance companies, which reduced the insurance receivable
    balance to $78 million. As of December 31, 2007, UE
    had a $121 million receivable due from insurance companies
    related to the rebuilding of the facility. Under UE’s
    insurance policies, all claims by or against UE are subject to
    review by its insurance carriers.

In September 2007, the Missouri Coalition for the Environment,
    the Sierra Club, and American Rivers filed a motion to seek
    intervention and rehearing and a stay of FERC authorization
    granted to UE to rebuild the upper reservoir at its Taum Sauk
    plant. In December 2007, FERC granted intervention, denied
    rehearing, and dismissed the request for stay. In February 2008,
    the Missouri Coalition for the Environment and the Missouri
    Parks Association filed an appeal of FERC’s decision with
    the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. We are
    unable to predict how or when the Court of Appeals will rule on
    this appeal.

In December 2007, the Missouri Parks Association filed a lawsuit
    in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
    against UE and FERC to stop the reconstruction of the upper
    reservoir at the Taum Sauk plant. The Missouri Parks Association
    claims that FERC failed to adequately study the environmental
    effect of reopening the hydroelectric plant or alternatives to
    rebuilding it. In January 2008, UE filed a motion to dismiss the
    lawsuit, arguing that the U.S. District Court lacks
    jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case. This motion is
    currently pending.

Until litigation has been resolved and the insurance review is
    completed, among other things, we are unable to determine the
    total impact the breach may have on Ameren’s and UE’s
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity beyond
    those amounts already recognized.



Mechanics’
    Liens

Approximately 20 mechanics’ liens were filed by various
    subcontractors who provided labor or material for a 2007 planned
    maintenance outage at the Duck Creek facility of CILCO
    subsidiary, AERG. The total lien claim amount was
    $26 million plus interest at December 31, 2007. In
    November 2007, the primary subcontractor on the project filed a
    complaint for foreclosure of its mechanic’s lien of
    $19 million plus interest against AERG in the Circuit Court
    of Fulton County, Illinois. AERG believes it has paid the
    general contractor the amount due in full (less a
    contract-allowed holdback of $4 million), and since this
    arose out of a contract dispute between the general contractor
    and the primary subcontractor, AERG is currently considering its
    potential remedies against the general contractor. At this time,
    we are unable to predict the impact of these liens and lawsuit
    on CILCO’s or AERG’s future results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.

Asbestos-related
    Litigation

Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been named, along
    with numerous other parties, in a number of lawsuits filed by
    plaintiffs claiming varying degrees of injury from asbestos
    exposure. Most have been filed in the Circuit Court of Madison
    County, Illinois. The total number of defendants named in each
    case is significant; as many as 189 parties are named in some
    pending cases and as few as six in others. However, in the cases
    that were pending as of December 31, 2007, the average
    number of parties was 70.

The claims filed against Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP
    allege injury from asbestos exposure during the plaintiffs’
    activities at our present or former electric generating plants.
    Former CIPS plants are now owned by Genco, and former CILCO
    plants are now owned by AERG. Most of IP’s plants were
    transferred to a Dynegy subsidiary prior to Ameren’s
    acquisition of IP. As a part of the transfer of ownership of the
    CIPS and CILCO generating plants, CIPS and CILCO have
    contractually agreed to indemnify Genco and AERG, respectively,
    for liabilities associated with asbestos-related claims arising
    from activities prior to the transfer. Each lawsuit seeks
    unspecified damages, which, if awarded at trial, typically would
    be shared among the various defendants.

From October 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007, six
    additional asbestos-related lawsuits were filed against UE,
    CIPS, CILCO and IP, mostly in the circuit court of Madison
    County, Illinois. Seven lawsuits were settled. The following
    table presents the status as of December 31, 2007, of the
    asbestos-related lawsuits that have been filed against the
    Ameren Companies:

Totals do not equal to the sum of
    the subsidiary unit lawsuits because some of the lawsuits name
    multiple Ameren entities as defendants.

As of December 31, 2007, nine asbestos-related lawsuits
    were pending against EEI. The general liability insurance
    maintained by EEI provides coverage with respect to liabilities
    arising from asbestos-related claims.

IP has a tariff rider to recover the costs of asbestos-related
    litigation claims, subject to the following terms. Beginning in
    2007, 90% of cash expenditures in excess of the amount included
    in base electric rates are recoverable by IP from a trust fund
    established by IP and financed with contributions of
    $10 million each by Ameren and Dynegy. At December 31,
    2007, the trust fund balance was $22 million, including
    accumulated interest.

If cash expenditures are less than the amount in base rates, IP
    will contribute 90% of the difference to the fund. Once the
    trust fund is depleted, 90% of allowed cash expenditures in
    excess of base rates will be recovered through charges assessed
    to customers under the tariff rider.

The Ameren Companies believe that the final disposition of these
    proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on their
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

NOTE 14 –

CALLAWAY NUCLEAR
    PLANT

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is
    responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent
    nuclear fuel. The DOE currently charges one mill, or


/


of one cent, per nuclear-generated kilowatthour sold for future
    disposal of spent fuel. Pursuant to this act, UE collects one
    mill from its electric customers for each kilowatthour of
    electricity that it generates and sells from its Callaway
    nuclear plant. Electric utility rates charged to customers
    provide for recovery of such costs. The DOE is not expected to
    have its permanent storage facility for spent fuel available
    until at least 2017. UE has sufficient installed storage
    capacity at its Callaway nuclear plant until 2020. It has the
    capability for additional storage capacity through the licensed
    life of the plant. The delayed availability of the DOE’s
    disposal facility is not expected to adversely affect the
    continued operation of the Callaway nuclear plant through its
    currently licensed life.

Electric utility rates charged to customers provide for the
    recovery of the Callaway nuclear plant’s decommissioning
    costs, which include decontamination, dismantling, and site
    restoration costs, over an assumed

40-year

life
    of the plant, ending with the expiration of the plant’s
    operating license in 2024. UE intends to submit a



license extension application with the NRC to extend its
    Callaway nuclear plant’s operating license to 2044. It is
    assumed that the Callaway nuclear plant site will then be
    decommissioned by immediate dismantlement and removal from
    service. Ameren and UE have recorded an ARO for the Callaway
    nuclear plant decommissioning costs at fair value, which
    represents the present value of estimated future cash outflows.
    See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies for additional information on asset retirement
    obligations. Decommissioning costs are charged to the costs of
    service used to establish electric rates for UE’s
    customers. These costs amounted to $7 million in each of
    the years 2007, 2006 and 2005. Every three years, the MoPSC
    requires UE to file an updated cost study for decommissioning
    its Callaway nuclear plant. Electric rates may be adjusted at
    such times to reflect changed estimates. The latest study was
    filed in 2005. Minor tritium contamination was discovered on the
    Callaway nuclear plant site in the summer of 2006. Existing
    facts and regulatory requirements indicate that this discovery
    will not cause any significant increase in the decommissioning
    cost estimate when the next study is conducted and filed on
    September 1, 2008. Costs collected from customers are
    deposited in an external trust fund to provide for the Callaway
    nuclear plant’s decommissioning. If the assumed return on
    trust assets is not earned, we believe that it is probable that
    any such earnings deficiency will be recovered in rates. The
    fair value of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund for
    UE’s Callaway nuclear plant is reported as Nuclear
    Decommissioning Trust Fund in Ameren’s and UE’s
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount is legally restricted.
    It may be used only to fund the costs of nuclear
    decommissioning. Changes in the fair value of the trust fund are
    recorded as an increase or decrease to the nuclear
    decommissioning trust fund and to a regulatory asset or
    regulatory liability, as appropriate.

NOTE 15 –

FAIR VALUE OF
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
    fair value of each class of financial instruments for which such
    estimates are practicable to estimate that value:

Cash, Temporary
    Investments, and Short-term Borrowings

The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the
    short-term maturity of these instruments.

Marketable
    Securities

The fair value is based on quoted market prices obtained from
    dealers or investment managers.

Nuclear
    Decommissioning Trust Fund

The fair value estimate is based on quoted market prices for
    securities held in the trust fund.

Long-term
    Debt

The fair value estimate is based on the quoted market prices for
    same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the
    Ameren Companies for debt of comparable maturities.

Preferred Stock
    of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP

The fair value estimate is based on the quoted market prices for
    the same or similar issues.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Market prices used to determine fair value are primarily based
    on published indices and closing exchange prices. In addition,
    valuations must rely on management’s estimates, which take
    into account time value of money and volatility factors.

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated
    fair values of our long-term debt and preferred stock at

UE has investments in debt and equity securities that are held
    in a trust fund for the purpose of funding the nuclear
    decommissioning of its Callaway nuclear plant. See
    Note 14 – Callaway Nuclear Plant for further
    information. We have classified these investments as available
    for sale and we have recorded all such investments at their fair
    market value at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Investments by the nuclear decommissioning trust fund are
    allocated 60% to 70% to equity securities, with the balance
    invested in fixed-income securities.

Downgrades of subprime U.S.

mortgage-related

assets have resulted in a decline in the fair value of

subprime-related

investments. UE has assessed the investments held in its nuclear
    decommissioning trust fund and determined that direct exposure
    to subprime mortgages was not material.

The following table presents proceeds from the sale of
    investments in UE’s nuclear decommissioning trust fund and
    the gross realized gains and losses on those sales for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Net realized and unrealized gains and losses are reflected in

    UE’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. This reporting is
    consistent with the method we use to account for the
    decommissioning costs recovered in rates. Gains or losses on
    assets in the trust fund could result in lower or higher funding
    requirements for decommissioning costs, which we believe would
    be reflected in electric rates paid by UE’s customers.

We have unrealized losses relating to certain available-for-sale
    investments included in our decommissioning trust fund. We
    believe that these losses are temporary in nature, and we expect
    the investments to recover their value in the future given the
    long-term nature of these investments. Decommissioning will not
    occur until the operating license for our nuclear facility
    expires. The following table presents the fair value and the
    gross unrealized losses of the available-for-sale securities
    held in UE’s nuclear decommissioning trust fund that were

(a)

Genco and CILCORP had no preferred
    stock outstanding.

During the third quarter of 2007, we identified a misallocation
    of first quarter 2007 purchased power expense among Ameren
    subsidiaries. The error resulted in an understatement of UE and
    Genco purchased power expense of approximately $7 million
    and $2 million, respectively, and an overstatement of CIPS,
    CILCORP, CILCO and IP purchased power expense of approximately
    $4 million, $1 million, $1 million, and
    $4 million, respectively, during the three months ended
    March 31, 2007. The error resulted in an overstatement of
    UE and Genco net income of $5 million and $1 million,
    respectively, and an understatement of CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and
    IP net income of approximately $3 million, $1 million,
    $1 million, and $3 million, respectively, during the
    three months ended March 31, 2007. The error did not have a
    significant impact on previously reported subsidiary balance
    sheets or statements of cash flows, and the error had no impact
    on Ameren’s previously reported consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP information for the
    quarter ended March 31, 2007 in the table above reflects
    the correction of this error. As a result, UE, CIPS, Genco,
    CILCORP, CILCO and IP financial information for the quarter
    ended March 31, 2007, in the table above differs from
    financial information reflected in the registrants’
    previously filed combined

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ended March 31, 2007.



ITEM 9.

CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

None.

ITEM 9A and
    ITEM 9A(T). CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Each of the Ameren Companies was required to comply with
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related
    SEC regulations as to management’s assessment of internal
    control over financial reporting for the 2007 fiscal year.

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2007, evaluations were performed, under
    the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including the principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer of each of the Ameren Companies, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of such
    registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Exchange Act). Based upon those evaluations, the principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer of each of the
    Ameren Companies have concluded that such disclosure controls
    and procedures are effective to provide assurance that
    information required to be disclosed in such registrant’s
    reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and such information
    is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its
    principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and 15d-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including the principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer, an evaluation was conducted of the
    effectiveness of each of the Ameren Companies’ internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). After making that evaluation under the
    framework in

Internal Control – Integrated
    Framework

issued by the COSO, management concluded that each
    of the Ameren Companies’ internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007. The
    effectiveness of Ameren’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in its report herein under
    Part II, Item 8. This annual report does not include
    an attestation report of UE’s, Genco’s, CIPS’,
    CILCO’s, CILCORP’s or IP’s (the Subsidiary
    Registrants) registered public accounting firm regarding
    internal control over financial reporting. Management’s
    report for the Subsidiary Registrants was not subject to
    attestation by the registered public accounting firm because
    temporary rules of the SEC permit the company to provide only
    management’s report in this annual report.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness into future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(c) Change in Internal Control

There has been no change in the Ameren Companies’ internal
    control over financial reporting during their most recent fiscal
    quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, their internal control over financial
    reporting.

ITEM 9B.

OTHER
    INFORMATION.

The Ameren Companies have no information reportable under this
    item that was required to be disclosed in a report on SEC

Form 8-K

during the fourth quarter of 2007 that has not previously been
    reported on an SEC

Form 8-K.

PART III

ITEM 10.

DIRECTORS,
    EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.

Information required by Items 401, 405, 406 and
    407(c)(3),(d)(4) and (d)(5) of SEC

Regulation S-K

for Ameren will be included in its definitive proxy statement
    for its 2008 annual meeting of shareholders filed pursuant to
    SEC Regulation 14A; it is incorporated herein by reference.
    Information required by these SEC

Regulation S-K

items for UE, CIPS and CILCO will be included in each
    company’s definitive information statement for its 2008
    annual meetings of shareholders filed pursuant to SEC
    Regulation 14C; it is incorporated herein by reference.
    Information required by these SEC

Regulation S-K

    contained in CIPS’ definitive information statement for
    CIPS’ 2008 annual meeting of shareholders filed pursuant to
    SEC Regulation 14C; it is incorporated herein by reference.
    With respect to Genco and CILCORP, this information is omitted
    in reliance on General Instruction I (2) of

Form 10-K.



Information concerning executive officers of the Ameren
    Companies required by Item 401 of SEC

Regulation S-K

is reported under a separate caption entitled “Executive
    Officers of the Registrants” in Part I of this report.

UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP do not have separately
    designated standing audit committees, but instead use
    Ameren’s audit and risk committee to perform such committee
    functions for their boards of directors. These companies have no
    securities listed on the NYSE and therefore are not subject to
    the NYSE listing standards. Douglas R. Oberhelman serves as
    chairman of Ameren’s audit and risk committee and
    Stephen F. Brauer, Susan S. Elliott and
    Richard A. Liddy serve as members. The board of directors
    of Ameren has determined that Douglas R. Oberhelman
    qualifies as an audit committee financial expert and that he is
    “independent” as that term is used in SEC
    Regulation 14A.

Also, on the same basis as reported above, the boards of
    directors of UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP use the
    nominating and corporate governance committee of Ameren’s
    board of directors to perform such committee functions. This
    committee is responsible for the nomination of directors and
    corporate governance practices. Ameren’s nominating and
    corporate governance committee will consider director
    nominations from shareholders in accordance with its Policy
    Regarding Nominations of Directors, which can be found on
    Ameren’s Web site: www.ameren.com.

To encourage ethical conduct in its financial management and
    reporting, Ameren has adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to
    the principal executive officer, the principal financial
    officer, the principal accounting officer, the controllers, and
    the treasurer of the Ameren Companies. Ameren has also adopted a
    Code of Business Conduct that applies to the directors, officers
    and employees of the Ameren Companies, referred to as the
    Corporate Compliance Policy. The Ameren Companies make available
    free of charge through Ameren’s Web site (www.ameren.com)
    the

Code of Ethics

and

Corporate Compliance
    Policy

. These documents are also available free in print
    upon written request to Ameren Corporation, Attention:
    Secretary, P.O. Box 66149, St. Louis, Missouri

63166-6149.

Any amendment to, or waiver of, the Code of Ethics and Corporate
    Compliance Policy will be posted on Ameren’s Web site
    within four business days following the date of the amendment or
    waiver.

Consists of the Ameren Corporation
    Long-term Incentive Plan of 1998, which was approved by
    shareholders in April 1998 and expires on April 1, 2008,
    and the Ameren Corporation 2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation
    Plan, which was approved by shareholders in May 2006 and expires
    on May 2, 2016. Pursuant to grants of performance share
    units (PSUs) under the Long-term Incentive Plan of 1998 and the
    2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, 745,058 of the
    securities represent PSUs at the target level of awards
    (including accrued and reinvested dividends). The actual number
    of shares issued in respect of the PSUs will vary from 0% to
    200% of the target level based on the achievement of total
    shareholder return objectives established for such awards.

(b)

PSUs are awarded when earned in
    shares of Ameren common stock on a one-for-one basis.
    Accordingly, the PSUs have been excluded for purposes of
    calculating the weighted-average exercise price.



UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP do not have separate
    equity compensation plans.
