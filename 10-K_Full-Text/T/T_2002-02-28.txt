PART I

ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

GENERAL

SBC Communications Inc.
(SBC) is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
in 1983 and has its principal executive offices at 175 E. Houston,
San Antonio, Texas 78205-2233 (telephone number 210-821-4105). SBC
maintains an Internet site at http://www.sbc.com. (This web site address is for
information only and is not intended to be an active link or to incorporate any
web site information into this document.)

Throughout this document SBC is referred to as "we" or "SBC".

History

SBC was formed as one of
several regional holding companies created to hold AT&T Corp.‘s
(AT&T) local telephone companies. On January 1, 1984, SBC was spun-off from
AT&T pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent
publicly traded telecommunications services provider. At formation, we primarily
operated in five southwestern states. SBC subsidiaries merged with Pacific
Telesis Group (PAC) in 1997, Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation
(SNET) in 1998 and Ameritech Corporation (Ameritech) in 1999, thereby expanding
our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier into a total of
13 states. Our services and products are marketed under several brands including
SBC Ameritech, SBC Nevada Bell, SBC Pacific Bell, SBC SNET, SBC Southwestern
Bell, and, through our joint venture with BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth),
Cingular Wireless (Cingular).

Scope

We rank among the largest
providers of telecommunications services in the United States and the world.
Through our subsidiaries, we provide communications services and products in the
United States and have investments in more than 25 countries. We offer our
services and products to businesses and consumers, as well as other providers of
telecommunications services.

The services and products
that we offer vary by market, and include: local exchange services, wireless
communications, long distance services, Internet services, telecommunications
equipment, messaging, paging, and directory advertising and publishing. We group
our operating subsidiaries as follows, corresponding to our operating segments
for financial reporting purposes:

wireline subsidiaries provide primarily land and wire based services,

wireless subsidiaries hold our investment in Cingular, which provides primarily radio wave based

services,

directory subsidiaries provide services related to directory advertising and publishing,

international subsidiaries hold investments in primarily foreign entities outside of the United
     States, and

other subsidiaries provide corporate operations, paging and prior to 2001,
     primarily provided security monitoring and cable television services.

Our principal wireline
subsidiaries provide telecommunications services in thirteen states: California,
Texas, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, Connecticut, Indiana, Wisconsin,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas and Nevada (13-state area). Certain wireline local
exchange services offered in the 13-state area are provided through regulated
subsidiaries which operate within authorized regions (in-region) subject to
regulation by each state in which they operate and by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC). Additional information relating to regulation is contained
under the heading “Government Regulation” below and in the 2001 SBC
Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading “Operating Environment and
Trends of the Business”, and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant
to General Instruction G(2).

InterLATA Long Distance

We offer interLATA (Local
Access and Transport Area) long distance services in the states of Texas,
Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and Connecticut. We intend to seek approval
from the FCC to offer interLATA long distance in our other in-region states. As
a first step in that process, we have filed applications with the state
commissions in California, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada and Ohio.

Additional information on
InterLATA Long Distance is contained in the 2001 SBC Annual Report to
Shareowners under the heading “Long Distance” on page 14 which is
incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Broadband Initiative

In 1999, as the first
post-Ameritech merger initiative, we announced a $6 billion initiative to
provide broadband services (Project Pronto). Project Pronto is expected to
create a broadband platform that will allow high-speed voice, data and video
services to be provided via Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) services to
approximately 80 percent of our United States (U.S.) wireline customers. During
the third quarter of 2001, due primarily to an adverse and uncertain regulatory
environment, we began a slowdown of the capital expenditures to build our
national broadband network, which includes fiber, electronic and other
technology. As of December 31, 2001 we had spent $3.2 billion on Project Pronto
and had 1.3 million DSL subscribers with more than half, or 25 million, of our
wireline customers DSL-capable.

Additional information on Project Pronto is contained in the 2001 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners under the
heading "Data/Broadband" on page 14 which is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction
G(2).

National Expansion

In 1999, we began
implementation of a “National-Local” strategy in conjunction with our
acquisition of Ameritech. We planned to offer local exchange services in 30 new
markets across the country. In March 2001, we announced a scale-back of our
offerings while still satisfying our regulatory obligations. We offered services
in 22 markets as of December 31, 2001, and are required by the FCC to enter into
the remaining eight markets by April 2002.

Additional information on
National Expansion is contained in the 2001 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners
under the heading “Out-of-Region Competition” on page 17 which is
incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Business
Combinations

SBC subsidiaries merged
with Ameritech in 1999, SNET in 1998 and PAC in 1997, resulting in each acquired
company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of SBC. Each transaction has been
accounted for as a pooling of interests and a tax-free reorganization.

As a result of the
Ameritech, SNET and PAC mergers, we significantly integrated operations and
consolidated some administrative and support functions. We recognized charges
during 1999, 1998 and 1997 in connection with these merger initiatives. Charges
arising out of the mergers relating to relocation, retraining and other effects
of consolidating certain operations were recognized in the periods those charges
occurred.

Additional information on
business combinations is contained in Note 2 of the 2001 SBC Annual Report to
Shareowners and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General
Instruction G(2).

BUSINESS
OPERATIONS

Operating
Segments

Our segments are strategic
business units that offer different products and services and are managed
accordingly. We evaluate performance based on income before income taxes
adjusted for normalizing (e.g., one-time) items. We have five reportable
segments that reflect the current management of our business: (1) wireline; (2)
wireless; (3) directory; (4) international; and (5) other.

In the second quarter of
2001, we moved the results of the SBC Services unit from the other segment to
the wireline segment as the SBC Services unit primarily supports the wireline
segment. We have restated all prior period information for the change, and this
had no effect on our consolidated results.

Additional information
about our reportable segments, including financial information and normalizing
items, is included under the heading “Segment Results” on pages 7
through 13 and in Note 5 of the 2001 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners and is
incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Wireline

Wireline is our largest
operating segment, providing approximately 75 percent of our normalized
operating revenues in 2001. Our wireline segment operates as both a retail and
wholesale seller of communication services. We provide landline
telecommunications services, including local, network access, long distance
services, messaging, Internet services, and customer premises and private branch
exchange (PBX) equipment. Our landline telecommunications subsidiaries serve
approximately 35.0 million residential, 23.9 million business and 0.5
million other access lines in our 13-state area.

Services and Products

Local exchange services

- Local exchange services include traditional dial tone primarily used to
make or receive voice, fax, or analog modem calls from a residence or business.
We also offer this service on a wholesale basis to competitors. At
December 31, 2001, we provided wholesale services to approximately 3.6
million access lines. Other local services include certain extended area
service, directory assistance and operator services.

Vertical services include
custom calling services such as Caller ID, Call Waiting, voice mail and other
enhanced services. These features allow telephone users to manage their local
services with enhanced features such as displaying the number and/or name of
callers, signaling to the telephone user that additional calls are incoming, and
sending and receiving voice messages. These services are not regulated by the
FCC and are generally more profitable.

Data services -

Revenues from data services may be classified as local, network access or long
distance revenues and include high-speed data communication services used for
transporting digital traffic from one computer system to another. Data services
include digital products categorized into three basic categories:

Switched Transport
services such as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), Frame Relay, and
DSL;

Dedicated Transport services such as Digital Services and Synchronous
Optical Network (SONET); and

Application and Data Communications services
which include Internet access and network integration.

ISDN transmits voice,
video, and data over a single line in support of a wide range of applications,
including Internet access. Frame Relay is a fast packet switching technology
that allows data to travel in individual packets, or pieces, of information. DSL
is a digital modem technology that converts existing twisted-pair telephone
lines into access paths for multimedia and high-speed data communications to the
Internet or private networks. DSL allows customers to simultaneously make a
phone call and access information via the Internet or an office local area
network. Digital Services are high-speed dedicated digital circuits offered with
various speeds of transport. SONET provides customer access to our backbone
network at very high speeds. Network integration services include installation
of business data systems, local area networking, and other data networking
solutions.

Network access services
- -

Network access services connect a customer’s telephone or other
equipment to the transmission facilities of other carriers that provide long
distance and other communications services.

Wireline long distance
- -

Wireline long distance services primarily result from the transport of
intraLATA telecommunications traffic that is outside of a local calling area.
Federal regulation prohibits us from providing interLATA long distance services
in seven of our 13 in-region states. We provide wireline interLATA long distance
to our customers in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and Connecticut.
Long distance services also include other services such as Wide Area
Telecommunications Service (WATS or 800 services) and other special services. In
addition, since 1996, we have offered wireline interLATA long distance services
to customers in selected areas outside the wireline subsidiaries’
authorized regions.

Customer premises
equipment (CPE) -

CPE and other equipment sales range from single-line and
cordless telephones to sophisticated digital PBX systems. PBX is a private
telephone switching system, usually located on a customer’s premises, which
provides intra-premise telephone services as well as access to the public
switched network.

Internet Services -

We offer a range of Internet services and products for residences and
businesses, varying by market. Internet services offered include basic dial-up
access service, dedicated access, web hosting, e-mail, and high-speed access
services. During 2000, we formed a relationship with Prodigy Communications
Corporation (Prodigy) that combined our residential and small business Internet
operations. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we acquired Prodigy.

Additional financial
information on the Prodigy acquisition is contained in Note 3 of the 2001 SBC
Annual Report to Shareowners and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to
General Instruction G(2).

Yahoo! Agreement

In November 2001, we
announced an agreement with Yahoo! to provide broadband access to customers in
our 13-state area and co-branded dial-up service nationwide. This agreement will
help our customers access our internet services virtually nationwide. We expect
to begin offering the co-branded service with Yahoo! during the second half of
2002.

Wireless

Our wireless segment
provides domestic wireless telecommunications services, including local, long
distance and roaming services. Wireless services and products offered also
include certain enhanced services, paging services and wireless equipment. Due
to the contribution of substantially all of our domestic wireless operations to
Cingular (discussed below), reported wireless results do not include revenues or
expenses from the wireless joint venture; instead we reflect our 60 percent
share of its net income as equity in net income of affiliates. However, for
evaluating the results of Cingular internally, we use proportional
consolidation. On that normalized basis, the wireless segment provided
approximately 16 percent of our 2001 operating revenues; on an actual reported
basis, less than one percent of our operating revenues came from our Wireless
segment.

Cingular Wireless Joint Venture

In April 2000, we formed a
joint venture with BellSouth to provide domestic wireless services nationally.
In October 2000, most of our and BellSouth’s wireless operations were
contributed to Cingular, which then began operations. At December 31, 2001,
Cingular served approximately 21.6 million customers, making it the second
largest wireless operator in the United States. Economic ownership in Cingular
is held 60 percent by us and 40 percent by BellSouth, with control shared
equally. We are accounting for our interest under the equity method of
accounting.

Additional information on
Cingular is contained in Note 7 of the 2001 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners and
is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

SpectraSite Agreement

In November 2001, we
amended our August 2000 agreement with SpectraSite Communications, Inc.
(SpectraSite) in which we granted SpectraSite the exclusive right to lease 3,900
communication towers for prepaid rents of $983 million in cash and SpectraSite
common stock valued at $325 million, or $22.659 per share, at the August 2000
closing. We have agreed to reduce the maximum number of communication towers to
be leased to SpectraSite to 3,600, and to extend the schedule for closing on
towers until the first quarter of 2004. As consideration for those
modifications, we received $35 million.

Wireless Auction

Cingular invested in a
participant in a December 2000/January 2001 FCC auction of wireless spectrum
licenses held by NextWave. A number of legal issues have emerged in connection
with this auction and it remains subject to legal, legislative and regulatory
proceedings.

Additional information on
this auction is contained in the 2001 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners under the
heading “Wireless” on page 20 which is incorporated herein by
reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Directory

Our directory segment
includes advertising, Yellow and White Pages directories and electronic
publishing. The directory operating segment provided approximately 8 percent of
our normalized operating revenues in 2001.

Our directory subsidiaries operate primarily in our 13-state region.

International

Our international segment
includes all of our investments with primarily international operations. We have
direct or indirect interests in businesses located in more than 25 countries and
as of December 31, 2001, have international investments with a carrying value of
approximately $8.2 billion. Our international investments include local and long
distance telephone services, wireless communications, voice messaging, data
services, video services, Internet access, telecommunications equipment, and
directory publishing.

Europe

We hold a 41.6 percent
stake in TDC A/S (TDC) (formerly known as Tele Danmark A/S), Denmark’s
primary full-service communications operator. TDC has a 16.5 percent investment
in Belgacom S.A. (Belgacom) as well as investments in wireless services in
Poland, the Ukraine, Lithuania, Austria, the Netherlands and Germany. It has
investments in competitive communications providers in Sweden, Germany,
Switzerland and the Czech Republic. TDC also has investments in local telephone
operations in Hungary and an international digital transmission link through
Russia, Korea and Japan. SBC currently is able to elect six of twelve members of
the TDC Board of Directors, including the Chairman, who would cast any
tie-breaking vote.

In January 2001, TDC
acquired a majority interest in diAx A.G (diAx), a wireless and long distance
provider in Switzerland owned by SBC International and diAx Holdings.

In Belgium, we hold a 17.5
percent stake in Belgacom, the country’s primary full-service
telecommunications operator, and effectively own 24.4 percent of Belgacom when
combined with our stake in TDC. With approximately 4.9 million access lines and
more than 4.0 million cellular customers, Belgacom provides local, long
distance, cellular and other communications services and offers directories and
security services. Belgacom also has telecommunications investments in France
and the Netherlands.

Belgacom has entered into
an agreement with an unaffiliated special purpose entity (SPE) that allows
Belgacom, at its discretion, the option to sell portions of its Netherlands
wireless operations to the SPE in unspecified amounts until the end of 2002. In
the fourth quarter of 2001, Belgacom sold a portion of its investment to the
SPE, lowering its ownership percentage from 35 percent to 27 percent. As part of
the transaction, Belgacom guaranteed the approximately $237 million in debt
incurred by the SPE in the purchase. All holders of stock in the wireless
company, including the SPE and TDC, which owns approximately 15 percent, have
the right to put the stock to a subsidiary of Deutsche Telecom A.G. beginning
January 2003. The SPE can put the shares at a price that is greater than the
amount guaranteed by Belgacom.

We hold a 15 percent equity
interest in Cegetel S.A. (Cegetel), a holding company, through a joint venture
with France’s Vivendi, a French diversified public company. Cegetel owns 80
percent of Societe Francaise du Radiotelephone, a wireless carrier in France
with over 11.6 million customers. Cegetel offers both mobile and fixed line
services.

Asia

In July 2001, we sold our interest in TransAsia Telecommunications Inc., a regional wireless
telecommunications provider in southern Taiwan.

North America

We have a 20 percent stake
in Bell Canada, Canada’s premier telecommunications provider. Bell Canada
offers services to more than 11.4 million residential and business customers,
including local, long distance and wireless communications, Internet access,
high-speed data services and directories.

From July 1, 2002 through
December 31, 2002, we have the option to sell all of our Bell Canada shares to
BCE Inc. (BCE) for an unspecified combination of cash and debt at fair market
value plus 25 percent. Similarly, BCE has the right to purchase our Bell Canada
shares during the same time frame at either the fair market value plus 25
percent or at our original investment amount compounded at an annual rate of 15
percent, whichever is greater. BCE is a publicly traded company with more than
23 million customer connections through its wireline, wireless, data and
Internet, and satellite services. It is Canada’s largest communications
company and owns approximately 80 percent of Bell Canada. We currently do not
know whether we or BCE will exercise our rights during that time frame. These
options are also available on the same terms from July 1, 2004, through December
31, 2004.

We own an 8.1 percent
equity share in Teléfonos de México, S.A. de C.V. (Telmex),
Mexico’s largest national telecommunications provider of wireline services.
Telmex operates approximately 13.3 million access lines. Through our
relationship, we have worked with Telmex to develop an advanced network, and
have helped Telmex achieve its goal of providing enhanced telephone service
throughout Mexico.

We are a member of a
consortium that holds all of the class AA shares of Telmex stock, representing
voting control of the company. Another member of the consortium, Carso Global
Telecom, S.A. de C.V. (Carso), has the right to appoint a majority of the
directors of Telmex.

In October 2000, in an
effort to promote competition, the Mexican government passed new
telecommunications rules for Telmex. The rules established interconnection
pricing guidelines and also barred Telmex from charging less for a service than
it charges to other carriers. Telmex obtained an injunction in Mexican court
against these rules and hearings remain pending. In December 2000, Telmex and
certain competitors reached an agreement that provided, among other things, that
competitors pay approximately $140 million to Telmex for past-due amounts
related to interconnection rates and approximately $550 million for local
network costs incurred by Telmex in 1997. The agreement also established an
interconnection rate of 1.25 cents per minute for 2001, compared with
approximately 3.34 cents in 2000. In addition, as part of the agreement, Telmex
will continue negotiations with competitors regarding a new cost-based
international settlement model and will review the proportional return
mechanism.

In February 2002, U.S.
trade officials announced that they will formally ask for a World Trade
Organization panel to investigate the allegation that Mexico has unfairly kept
U.S. companies from competing in its $12 billion telecommunications market.

As of December 31, 2001,
Telmex had approximately 70 percent of the long distance market in Mexico.
Telmex’s share of international long distance traffic is expected to
decline significantly when the proportional return mechanism expires. This
mechanism guarantees Telmex the same percentage of incoming traffic as outgoing
traffic. In December 2001, Telmex and some of its competitors agreed to
eliminate the proportional return mechanism at the end of 2003 and to a
phased-in reduction of the settlement rate: 15.5 cents in 2001, 13.5 cents in
2002, 10 cents in 2003, and free market in 2004. In a later December 2001
agreement, Telmex and its competitors agreed to reduce the interconnection rate
to 0.975 cents per minute for 2002 from 1.25 cents per minute for 2001. Local
competition is expected to increase in 2002, primarily for business customers.
We do not expect the carrier agreement or rules affecting Telmex to have a
material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In 2000, Telmex spun-off
its wireless and certain other operations to its shareowners as a separate
business, América Móvil S.A. de C.V. (América Móvil), which
serves more than 25 million wireless customers. We own an 8 percent interest in
América Móvil.

We are a member of a
consortium that holds all of the class AA shares of América Móvil
stock, representing voting control of the company. Another member of the
consortium, Carso, had the right to appoint a majority of the directors of
América Móvil. In January 2002, Carso transferred its ownership
interest in América Móvil to Americas Telecom S.A. de C.V., and with
that the right to appoint a majority of the directors of América
Móvil.

South America

In February 2002, Telecom
Américas Ltd. (Telecom Americas), a joint venture with América
Móvil and Bell Canada International Inc., was reorganized to focus on the
provision of wireless in Brazil. As a result of the reorganization our interest
in Telecom Americas was reduced from 12.8 percent to 12.4 percent, and may be
further diluted to 8.3 percent over the next two and one-half years. The
reorganization of Telecom Americas does not alter the provisions of the option
granted to América Móvil discussed in the following paragraph.

In January 2002, we
purchased from América Móvil its approximately 50 percent of Cellular
Communications of Puerto Rico (CCPR) for cash and an option redeemable for our
investment in Telecom Americas. This represents a forward sale of our interest
in Telecom Americas. In connection with this transaction, we reviewed the values
at which we would carry CCPR and our interest in Telecom Americas and recognized
a charge of $390 million ($262 million net of tax) for the reduction of our
direct and indirect book values to the value indicated by the transaction. The
charges were recorded in both other income (expense) – net $(341) million
and equity in net income of affiliates $(49) million.

Africa/Middle East

We hold an 18 percent
ownership stake in Telkom S.A. Limited (Telkom), South Africa’s state-owned
local exchange and long distance company. Currently, Telkom serves nearly 5.0
million access lines in South Africa, and also is developing a second national
wireless network serving more than 5.9 million wireless customers through
Telkom’s wireless subsidiary, Vodacom.

We own a 13.3 percent stake
in Amdocs Limited (Amdocs), a major supplier of billing and customer service
software used by telecommunications companies worldwide. Amdocs, a Gurnsey
Island corporation, has operations throughout the world with many of its
programming support services located in Israel.

Financial information about
foreign and domestic operations is included in Note 7 of the 2001 SBC Annual
Report to Shareowners and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to
General Instruction G(2).

Other

During 2001, we sold
SecurityLink, Ameritech’s security monitoring service, and the operational
assets of Ameritech New Media, our cable television operations.

Additional information on
the sale of these businesses is contained in Note 3 of the 2001 SBC Annual
Report to Shareowners and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to
General Instruction G(2).

GOVERNMENT
REGULATION

In the 13-state area,
certain of our wireline subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state
commissions which have the power to regulate, in varying degrees, intrastate
rates and services, including local, long distance and network access services.
Certain wireline subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC
with respect to interstate and international rates and services, including
interstate access charges. Access charges are designed to compensate the
wireline subsidiaries for the use of their facilities for the origination or
termination of long distance and access services by other carriers.

Additional information
relating to federal and state regulation of the wireline subsidiaries is
contained in the 2001 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading
“Regulatory Environment” beginning on page 15, and is incorporated
herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

IMPORTANCE,
DURATION AND EFFECT OF LICENSES

Certain of our subsidiaries
own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks and other
intellectual property necessary to conduct business. We also license other
companies to use this intellectual property. We do not believe that the
expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, or the nonrenewal of
those rights, would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations.

MAJOR
CUSTOMER

No customer accounted for
more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2001, 2000 or 1999.

COMPETITION

Information relating to
competition in each of our operating segments is contained in the 2001 SBC
Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading “Competition” beginning
on page 19, and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General
Instruction G(2).

RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT

The majority of our
research and development activities are related to our wireline segment. Applied
research, technology planning and evaluation services are conducted at our
subsidiary, SBC Technology Resources, Inc. We also have a research agreement
with Telcordia Technologies, formerly Bell Communications Research, Inc.
Research and development expenses were not material in 2001, 2000 or 1999.

EMPLOYEES

As of January 31, 2002, we
employed approximately 192,550 persons. Approximately two-thirds of our
employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).

In February 2001, our
telephone subsidiaries reached agreements with the CWA covering employees in
thirteen states. The new agreements expire in March 2004 and include a wage
increase of approximately 12.25 percent over the life of the contracts, in
addition to other economic provisions.

The IBEW represents
approximately 12,000 employees and their labor agreement expires in June 2003.

During 2001, as part of our
force-reduction program, an enhanced retirement program (ERB) was offered to
eligible PTG nonmanagement employees. The ERB program offered eligible employees
who voluntarily decided to terminate employment an enhanced pension benefit and
increased eligibility for postretirement medical and dental benefits.
Approximately 1,400 employees accepted this offer and terminated employment
before the end of December 31, 2001.

In the fourth quarter of 2001, we transferred approximately 17,000 employees that were previously leased to
Cingular; these individuals are now on Cingular’s payroll with coverage under Cingular’s benefits plans.

RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS

In February 2002,
consultants hired by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) issued a
report on their 1997-1999 audit of our California wireline subsidiary. The
report concluded that we understated regulated net operating income reported to
the CPUC and should issue refunds, i.e., service credits, to customers for 1997
and 1998 totaling approximately $350. We do not agree with the report’s
conclusions and will contest them in proceedings before the CPUC.

CAUTIONARY
LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Information set forth in
this report contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking
statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the
forward-looking statements:

Adverse economic changes in the markets served by SBC or in countries in which
SBC has significant investments.

Changes in available technology and the effects of such changes including
product substitutions and deployment costs.

The final outcome of FCC proceedings, including rulemakings, and judicial
review, if any, of such proceedings, including issues relating to jurisdiction.

The final outcome of state regulatory proceedings in SBC’s 13-state area,
and judicial review, if any, of such proceedings, including proceedings relating
to interconnection terms, access charges, universal service, unbundled network
elements and resale rates, SBC’s broadband initiative known as Project
Pronto, service standards and reciprocal compensation.

Enactment of additional state, federal and/or foreign regulatory laws and
regulations pertaining to our subsidiaries and foreign investments.

The timing of entry and the extent of competition in the local and intraLATA
toll markets in SBC’s 13-state area and our entry into the in-region long
distance market.

The impact of the Ameritech transaction, including performance with respect to
regulatory requirements, and merger integration efforts.

The timing, extent and cost of deployment of Project Pronto, its effect on the
carrying value of the existing wireline network and the level of consumer demand
for offered services.

The impact of the wireless joint venture with BellSouth, known as Cingular,
including marketing and product-development efforts, access to additional
spectrum, technological advancements and financial capacity.

Readers are cautioned that other factors discussed in this report, although not enumerated here, also could
materially impact our future earnings.

ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES

Our properties do not lend
themselves to description by character and location of principal units. At
December 31, 2001, approximately 99 percent of our property, plant and equipment
was owned by our wireline subsidiaries. Network access lines represented
approximately 39 percent of the wireline subsidiaries’ investment in
telephone plant; central office equipment represented approximately 41 percent;
land and buildings represented approximately 9 percent; other equipment,
comprised principally of furniture and office equipment and vehicles and other
work equipment, represented approximately 7 percent; and other miscellaneous
property represented approximately 4 percent.

Substantially all of the
installations of central office equipment are located in buildings and on land
which we own. Many garages, administrative and business offices and telephone
centers are in leased quarters.

ITEM 3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to various legal
and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any pending proceedings,
as of the date of this report, we do not believe that any pending legal
proceedings to which we or our subsidiaries are subject are required to be
disclosed as material legal proceedings pursuant to this item.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

PART II

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
         STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

The number of shareowners
of record as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 were 1,086,775 and 1,148,570.
During 2001, non-employee directors acquired from SBC shares of common stock
pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferral Plan. Under the plan, a
director may make an annual election to receive all or part of his or her annual
retainer or fees in the form of SBC shares or deferred stock units (DSUs) that
are convertible into SBC shares. Each Director also receives an annual grant of
DSUs. During 2001 an aggregate of 116,100 SBC shares and DSUs were acquired by
non-employee directors at prices ranging from $38.95 to $52.38, in each case the
fair market value of the shares on the date of acquisition. The issuances of
shares and DSUs were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act.
