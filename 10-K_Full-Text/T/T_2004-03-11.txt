ITEM 1. BUSINESS

                                                      GENERAL

SBC Communications Inc. ("SBC" or "we") is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
in 1983 and has its principal executive offices at 175 E. Houston, San Antonio, Texas 78205-2233 (telephone
number 210-821-4105).  We maintain an internet site at http://www.sbc.com.  (This website address is for
information only and is not intended to be an active link or to incorporate any website information into this
document.)  We make available, free of charge, on our website our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably
practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the SEC.  We also make available on our website, and
in print, if any shareholder or other person so requests, our code of business conduct and ethics entitled "Code
of Ethics" applicable to all employees and Directors, our "Corporate Governance Guidelines", and the charters for
the Audit, Human Resources and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees of our Board of Directors.  Any
changes to our Code of Ethics or waiver of our Code of Ethics for senior financial officers, executive officers
or Directors will be posted on our website.

History

SBC was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold AT&T Corp.'s local telephone companies.
On January 1, 1984, SBC was spun-off from AT&T pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent
publicly traded telecommunications services provider.  At formation, we primarily operated in five southwestern
states.  Our subsidiaries merged with Pacific Telesis Group in 1997, Southern New England Telecommunications
Corporation in 1998 and Ameritech Corporation in 1999, thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent
local exchange carrier into a total of 13 states.  Our services and products are marketed under several brands
including SBC, through our joint venture with BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth), Cingular Wireless (Cingular), and
through our alliance with Yahoo!, SBC Yahoo!.

Scope

We rank among the largest providers of telecommunications services in the U.S. and the world.  Through our
subsidiaries, we provide communications services and products in the U.S. and have investments in more than 25
countries.  We offer our services and products to businesses and consumers, as well as other providers of
telecommunications services.

The services and products that we offer vary by market, and include: local exchange services, wireless
communications, long-distance services, internet services, telecommunications equipment, and directory
advertising and publishing.  In the first quarter of 2004, we began offering satellite television services
through our agreement with EchoStar Communications Corp. (EchoStar).  These results will be recorded in our
wireline segment.  We group our operating subsidiaries as follows, corresponding to our operating segments for
financial reporting purposes:

o   wireline subsidiaries provide primarily land and wire based services,
o   wireless subsidiaries hold our investment in Cingular, which provides primarily radio-wave based
    services,
o   directory subsidiaries provide services related to directory advertising and publishing,
o   international subsidiaries hold investments in primarily foreign entities outside of the U.S., and
o   other subsidiaries provide primarily corporate operations.

Our principal wireline subsidiaries provide telecommunications services in thirteen states: Arkansas, California,
Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wisconsin
(13-state area).  Wireline local exchange services offered in our 13-state area are provided through regulated
subsidiaries which operate within authorized regions subject to regulation by each state in which they operate
and by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  Additional information relating to regulation is contained
under the heading "Government Regulation" below and in the 2003 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners under the
heading "Operating Environment and Trends of the Business", and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to
General Instruction G(2).

InterLATA Long-distance

We are authorized to offer wireline interLATA (traditional) long-distance services nationwide but we provide
services primarily to customers in our 13-state area and to customers in selected areas outside our wireline
subsidiaries' operating areas.

Broadband Initiative

In October 1999, we announced plans to upgrade our network to make broadband digital subscriber line (DSL)
services available to approximately 80% of our U.S. wireline customers over the four years through 2003 (Project
Pronto).  Due to the weakening U.S. economy and an uncertain and adverse regulatory environment, in October 2001
we announced a scale-back in our broadband deployment plans.  As discussed in greater detail below, in August
2003, the FCC released its Triennial Review Order, which appears to provide some relief from unbundling
requirements for broadband and new fiber facilities and equipment used to provide data and high-speed internet
access services.  However, because the new broadband rules contain some ambiguities and have been appealed to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit), and are subject to petitions for
reconsideration or clarification before the FCC, we continue to face uncertainty regarding the regulatory
treatment of our broadband investments.  Nevertheless, due to increasing growth opportunities and competition, we
have resumed a Project Pronto-related limited build-out and expect to have DSL available to nearly 80% of our
wireline customer locations in early 2004, up from 75% at December 31, 2003.  Our DSL lines, which provide
broadband internet access, continue to grow and were approximately 3,515,000 at December 31, 2003, compared to
2,199,000 at the end of 2002.

The FCC has begun reviewing the rules governing broadband services offered by cable, satellite and wireless
operators in addition to traditional wireline offerings.  The FCC tentatively concluded that wireline broadband
internet access services are "information" services rather than "telecommunications" services, which would result
in less regulation.  In October 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (9th Circuit)
ruled that broadband internet access services provided by cable operators involve both an "information service"
and a "telecommunications" service.  If this decision is upheld (the FCC has a request for rehearing pending
before the 9th Circuit), the FCC may change its tentative conclusion that wireline broadband internet access
services are information services, not telecommunications services.  It is likely that the FCC will not act in
these proceedings until the 9th Circuit rules on its request for rehearing.  We are not certain of the effect the
9th Circuit's decision will have on our operations or financial statements.

Cable operators have no general obligation to provide third-party Internet Service Providers (ISPs) access to
their broadband networks at this time, although the FCC has begun a proceeding to consider the issue.  The 9th
Circuit's decision (discussed above) could support the imposition on cable operators of some of the same
regulations applicable to wireline companies but it is unclear at this time whether the decision will have a
significant impact on providers of cable modem services.

In December 2002, the FCC ruled that advanced services, such as DSL, when provided through one of our separate
subsidiaries, are not subject to tariff regulations and cost study requirements.  However, we are still required
to retain cost data and offer our retail advanced services for resale at a discount.  This ruling should allow us
to respond more quickly to offerings by unregulated competitors.  The FCC is expected to complete its broadband
review during 2004.  The effect of the review on our results of operations and financial position cannot be
determined at this time.

Voice over Internet Protocol

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is generally used to describe the transmission of voice and data using
Internet-based technology rather than a traditional wire and switch-based telephone network.  As a result, this
technology can provide services, although not necessarily of the same quality, often at a lower cost because a
traditional network need not be constructed and maintained and because it has not been subject to traditional
telephone industry regulation.  In early 2004, the FCC opened a rule making proceeding on VoIP.  The rulemaking is
expected to address whether and how a wide range of regulations should be applied to VoIP, including issues
related to federal and state jurisdiction, intercarrier compensation, universal service, public safety, consumer
protection and other matters.  During 2003, a number of state utility commissions also began proceedings to
examine the regulatory treatment of VoIP.

Notwithstanding the unresolved regulatory questions before the FCC and the state commissions, numerous
communications providers began providing various forms of VoIP in 2003, or announced their intentions to do so in
the near future.  These providers include both established companies as well as new entrants.  Thus, while the
deployment of VoIP will result in increased competition for our core wireline voice services, it also presents
growth opportunities for us to develop new products for our customers.

Cingular

Cingular, our wireless joint venture with BellSouth, began operations in October 2000.  Cingular serves
approximately 24.8 million customers and is the second-largest provider of mobile wireless voice and data
communications services in the U.S., based on the number of wireless customers.  Cingular has access to licenses
on the 850 and 1900 MHz bands to provide cellular or PCS wireless communications services covering an aggregate
population of potential customers, referred to as "POPs", of approximately 236 million, or approximately 81% of
the U.S. population, including 45 of the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas.  See "Recent Developments" below for
a discussion of Cingular's pending acquisition of AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. (AT&T Wireless).

Cingular's wireless networks use equipment with digital transmission technologies known as Global System for
Mobile Communication (GSM) technology and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technology.  Cingular
substantially completed upgrading its existing TDMA markets to use GSM technology in order to provide a common
voice standard.  Cingular's GSM network now covers approximately 93% of Cingular's POPs.  Additionally, through
roaming agreements with other carriers, Cingular customers have GSM coverage in approximately 90% of the U.S.
Also, Cingular is adding high-speed technologies for data services known as General Packet Radio Services (GPRS)
and Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE).

Cingular is in the process of upgrading its network to third generation (3G) wireless data technology by using
EDGE.  EDGE technology is Cingular's choice for a 3G wireless communications standard that will allow customers
to access the Internet from their wireless devices at higher speeds than even GPRS.  At December 31, 2003,
Cingular's EDGE technology covered approximately 20% of its POPs.  Cingular expects the GSM/GPRS/EDGE network
overlay to be fully complete by the end of 2004.

                                                BUSINESS OPERATIONS

Operating Segments

Our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services and are managed
accordingly.  Under U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) segment reporting rules, we analyze our
various operating segments based on segment income.  Interest expense, interest income, other income (expense) -
net and income tax expense are managed only on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in
consolidated results.  Therefore, these items are not included in the calculation of each segment's percentage of
our consolidated results.  We have five reportable segments that reflect the current management of our business:
(1) wireline; (2) Cingular; (3) directory; (4) international; and (5) other.

Additional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading
"Segment Results" on pages 9 through 18 and in Note 4 of the 2003 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners and is
incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Wireline

Wireline is our largest operating segment, providing approximately 65% of 2003 revenues and 46% of income from
all our segments.  Our wireline segment operates as both a retail and wholesale seller of communication
services.  We provide landline telecommunications services, including local, long-distance voice, switched
access, data, and messaging services.  Our landline telecommunications subsidiaries serve approximately 28.8
million retail consumer, 18.3 million retail business, 7.1 million wholesale and 0.5 million other access lines,
for a total of 54.7 million access lines in our 13-state area.

Services and Products

We divide our wireline services into four product-based categories - voice, data, long-distance and other.

Voice - Voice includes traditional local service provided to retail customers and wholesale access to our network
and individual network elements provided to competitors.  Voice also includes calling features (described below),
fees to maintain wire located inside customer premises, pay telephones, customer premise equipment and other
equipment sales (described below) and other miscellaneous voice products.

Calling features are enhanced telephone services available to retail customers such as Caller ID, Call Waiting,
and voice mail.  Customers that subscribe to these services can have the number and/or name of callers displayed
on their phone, be signaled that additional calls are incoming, and send and receive voice messages.  These
services are not regulated by the FCC and are generally more profitable than basic local phone service.

Customer premises equipment and other equipment sales range from single-line and cordless telephones to
sophisticated digital PBX systems.  PBX is a private telephone switching system, typically used by businesses and
usually located on a customer's premises, which provides intra-premise telephone services as well as access to
our network.

Data - Data includes traditional products, such as switched and dedicated transport, internet access and network
integration, and data equipment sales.

Switched Transport services transmit data using switching equipment to transfer the data between multiple lines
before reaching its destination.  Dedicated Transport services use a single direct line to transmit data between
destinations.  Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), Dedicated Frame Relay, DSL, Digital Services and
Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) are examples of Dedicated Transport services.  ISDN transmits voice, video,
and data over a single line in support of a wide range of applications, including internet access.  Frame Relay
is a routing technology that breaks a data signal into individual pieces of data to travel at high speeds and
then recombines the data prior to arriving at its destination.  DSL is a digital modem technology that converts
existing twisted-pair telephone lines into access paths for multimedia and high-speed data communications to the
Internet or private networks.  DSL allows customers to simultaneously make a phone call and access information
via the Internet or an office local area network.  Digital Services use dedicated digital circuits to transmit
digital data at various high rates of speed.  SONET provides customer access to our backbone network at various
high speeds.

Network integration services include installation of business data systems, local area networking, and other data
networking offerings.  Internet access services include a wide range of products for residences and businesses,
varying by market.  Internet services offered include basic dial-up access service, dedicated access, web
hosting, e-mail, and high-speed access services.

EchoStar Agreement

In July 2003, we entered into a co-branded service agreement with EchoStar to offer satellite television service to
customers in our 13-state area.  Additional information on this agreement is contained in the 2003 SBC Annual Report
to Shareowners under the heading "Other Business Matters - EchoStar Agreement" beginning on page 29 and is
incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Yahoo! Alliance

In November 2001, we formed a strategic alliance with Yahoo! to provide co-branded broadband and dial-up service
to residential customers nationwide.  During 2003, SBC and Yahoo! expanded the alliance to include co-branded
broadband and dial-up services designed for small businesses.

Long-distance voice - Long-distance voice consists of all interLATA (traditional long-distance) and intraLATA
(local toll) wireline revenues, including calling card and 1-800 services.  Prior to 2003, Federal regulations
prohibited us from offering interLATA wireline long-distance services in six of our 13 states.  During 2003, we
received regulatory approval to offer these services to customers in these remaining six states.  We now may
provide interLATA wireline long-distance to customers nationwide.

Other - Other includes directory and operator assistance, and billing and collection services for other carriers.

Cingular

The Cingular segment reflects 100% of the results reported by Cingular, our wireless joint venture.  This segment
replaces our previously titled "wireless" segment, which included 60% of Cingular's revenues and expenses.  In our
consolidated financial statements, we report our 60% proportionate share of Cingular's results as equity in net
income (loss) of affiliates.  For segment reporting, we report this equity in net income (loss) of affiliates in our
other segment.

While our consolidated operating revenues do not include Cingular's results, we do include 100% of Cingular's
revenues and expenses when we analyze our operating segment results.  On that segment basis, the Cingular segment
provided approximately 27% of revenues and 12% of income from all our segments in 2003.

Cingular Wireless Joint Venture

In April 2000, we formed a joint venture with BellSouth to provide domestic wireless services nationally.  In
October 2000, most of our and BellSouth's Domestic wireless operations were contributed to Cingular, which then
began operations.  Economic ownership in Cingular is held 60% by us and 40% by BellSouth.  We have equal voting
rights and representation on the board of directors that controls Cingular.  Because we share control equally, we
use the equity method of accounting to account for our interest.  Cingular is an SEC registrant by virtue of its
publicly traded debt securities.  Accordingly, it files separate Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other reports with the SEC.

Cingular faces substantial competition in all aspects of its business as competition continues to increase in the
wireless communications industry.  Under current FCC rules, six or more PCS licensees, two cellular licensees and
one or more enhanced specialized mobile radio licensees may operate in each of Cingular's markets.  On average,
Cingular has four to five other wireless competitors in each of its markets and competes for customers based
principally on price, service offerings, call quality, coverage area and customer service.

Cingular's competitors are principally five national (Verizon Wireless, AT&T Wireless, Sprint PCS, Nextel
Communications and T-Mobile) and a larger number of regional providers of cellular, PCS and other wireless
communications services.  Cingular also competes with resellers and wireline service providers.  Moreover, Cingular
may experience significant competition from companies that provide similar services using other communications
technologies and services.  While some of these technologies and services are now operational, others are being
developed or may be developed in the future.

See "Recent Developments" below for a discussion of Cingular's pending acquisition of AT&T Wireless.  Cingular
agreed to acquire AT&T Wireless to expand its available spectrum and its network coverage and quality, and to
enhance its ability to offer future high-speed data services.

Additional information on Cingular is contained in the 2003 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading
"Expected Growth Areas - Wireless" beginning on page 21 and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General
Instruction G(2).

Directory

Our directory segment includes advertising, Yellow and White Pages directories and electronic directory
publishing.  The directory segment provided approximately 8% of revenues and 26% of income from all our segments
in 2003.  Our directory subsidiaries operate primarily in our 13-state area.

International

Our international segment includes all of our investments with primarily international operations.  We have
direct or indirect interests in businesses located in more than 25 countries and as of December 31, 2003, have
international investments with a carrying value of approximately $7 billion.  Our international investments
include companies that provide local and long-distance telephone services, wireless communications, voice
messaging, data services, internet access, telecommunications equipment, and directory publishing.  We report
earnings from this segment as equity in net income of affiliates rather than as operating revenue because this
segment consists almost exclusively of investments where, under GAAP, we have significant influence rather than
control.  Because most of our international investments are accounted for on the equity method, revenues from our
international segment were less than 1% of 2003 revenues from all our segments.  The international segment
provided approximately 7% of income from all our segments in 2003.

We describe below our foreign equity method investments and significant transactions relating to these
investments.  Additional information about this segment is included in Note 6 of the 2003 SBC Annual Report to
Shareowners and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Europe

We hold a 41.6% stake in TDC A/S (TDC), Denmark's primary full-service communications operator.  TDC also has
investments in full service communications providers in Switzerland with a 100% investment in TDC Switzerland AG
(Sunrise), and in Belgium with a 15.9% investment in Belgacom S.A. (Belgacom).  TDC has investments in wireless
services in Lithuania, Poland, Austria and Germany.  TDC also has investments in communications providers in the
Czech Republic, Hungary, Finland, Norway and Sweden.  We currently have six representatives on the twelve-member
TDC Board of Directors, including the Chairman, who would cast any tie-breaking vote.

In January 2001, TDC acquired a majority interest in diAx A.G (diAx), a wireless long-distance and internet
service provider in Switzerland.  In the first quarter of 2003, TDC acquired the remaining shares from diAx
Holdings, pursuant to an agreement negotiated at the time of the original transaction.  Sunrise was merged with
diAx in January 2001.

In Belgium, we hold a 16.9% stake in Belgacom, that country's primary full-service telecommunications operator,
and effectively own 23.5% of Belgacom when our direct stake is combined with the stake we hold indirectly through
TDC.  With approximately 4.6 million access lines and more than 3.7 million cellular customers, Belgacom provides
local, long-distance, cellular and other communications services.  In October 2003, Belgacom announced that its
shareholders had agreed to proceed with the preparations for a potential initial public offering of Belgacom.
Additional information on this transaction is contained in Note 6 of the 2003 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners
and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

In January 2003, we sold to Vodafone Group PLC (Vodafone) our 15% equity interest in Cegetel S.A. (Cegetel), a
joint venture that owns 80% of the second-largest wireless provider in France.  Additional information on this
transaction is contained in Note 2 of the 2003 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners and is incorporated herein by
reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Latin America

We own an 8% equity share in Telefonos de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (Telmex), Mexico's largest national provider of
wireline services.  Telmex operates approximately 15.6 million access lines.  We are a member of a consortium that
holds all of the class AA shares of Telmex stock, representing voting control of the company.  Another member of
the consortium, Carso Global Telecom, S.A. de C.V., has the right to appoint a majority of the directors of Telmex.

In December 2002 and March 2003, a World Trade Organization panel held hearings to investigate the allegation
that Mexico has unfairly kept U.S. companies from competing in its $12 billion telecommunications market.  The
final report from the panel is expected in March of 2004.

As of December 31, 2003, Telmex had approximately 75% of the long-distance market in Mexico.  Telmex's share of
international long-distance traffic may decline significantly when the "proportional return mechanism" rules
expire.  This mechanism guarantees Telmex the same percentage of incoming traffic as outgoing traffic.  In 2002,
Telmex and its competitors agreed on new rates.  Although these new rates expired in January 2004 the rates
nevertheless will remain in effect until the Mexican government modifies the rules or new agreements are reached
between Telmex and other carriers.

In 2000, Telmex spun-off its wireless and certain other operations to its shareowners as a separate business,
America Movil S.A. de C.V. (America Movil), which serves more than 43.7 million wireless customers in Argentina,
Brazil, Columbia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, the U. S. and Venezuela.  We own a 7.6% interest in America Movil.
We are a member of a consortium that holds all of the class AA shares of America Movil stock, representing voting
control of the company.  Another member of the consortium, Americas Telecom S.A. de C. V., has the right to
appoint a majority of the directors of America Movil.

Africa

We hold an 18% indirect ownership stake in Telkom S.A. Limited (Telkom), South Africa's largest local exchange
and long-distance company.  Telkom serves nearly 4.8 million access lines in South Africa, and also owns 50% of a
second national wireless network operator serving more than 10.2 million wireless customers through Telkom's
wireless joint venture, Vodacom.




MAJOR CLASSES OF SERVICE

The following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated total reported operating revenues by any class of
service that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated total operating revenues in any of the last three
fiscal years.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 Approximately 95%, 96% and 96% of directory advertising revenues were recorded in the directory segment for
  2003, 2002 and 2001.  The remaining directory advertising revenues were recorded in the wireline segment.

Voice and Data are included in the wireline segment and each also exceeds 10% of the wireline segment's total
operating revenues.   Our Cingular segment revenues are reported in equity in net income of affiliates in our
consolidated financial statements due to our equity accounting for the joint venture.  Directory advertising
revenues are included in our directory segment's results of operations and are approximately 97% of directory's
total operating revenues.

We account for our 60% economic interest in Cingular under the equity method of accounting in our consolidated
financial statements since we share control equally (i.e. 50/50) with our 40% economic partner in the joint
venture.  We have equal voting rights and representation on the board of directors that controls Cingular.  This
means that our consolidated reported results include Cingular's results in the "Equity in Net Income of
Affiliates" line.  We do not report Cingular revenues on our consolidated financial statements.  However, when
analyzing our segment results, we evaluate Cingular's results on a stand-alone basis.  The table below shows the
effect on our other classes of services (shown in the above table) if we include 100% of Cingular's revenues
added to our total segment operating revenues.

                                               GOVERNMENT REGULATION

In our 13-state area, our wireline subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state commissions which have the power
to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local, long-distance and network access services.  Our wireline
subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to interstate and international rates and
services, including interstate access charges.  Access charges are designed to compensate our wireline subsidiaries
for the use of their networks by other carriers.

Additional information relating to federal and state regulation of our wireline subsidiaries is contained in the
2003 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading "Regulatory Developments" beginning on page 22, and is
incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

                                    IMPORTANCE, DURATION AND EFFECT OF LICENSES

Certain of our subsidiaries own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks and other
intellectual property necessary to conduct business.  We also license other companies to use this intellectual
property.  We do not believe that the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, or the nonrenewal of
those rights, would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations.

                                                  MAJOR CUSTOMER

No customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2003, 2002 or 2001.

                                                    COMPETITION

Information relating to competition in each of our operating segments is contained in the 2003 SBC Annual Report
to Shareowners under the heading "Competition" beginning on page 25, and is incorporated herein by reference
pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

                                             RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The majority of our research and development activities are related to our wireline segment.  Applied research,
technology planning and evaluation services are conducted at our subsidiary, SBC Laboratories, Inc. We also have
a research agreement with Telcordia Technologies, formerly Bell Communications Research, Inc.  Research and
development expenses were not material in 2003, 2002 or 2001.

                                                     EMPLOYEES

As of January 31, 2004, we employed approximately 168,000 persons.  Approximately 112,000 of our employees are
represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA) or the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers (IBEW).  The four largest collective bargaining agreements between the CWA and our subsidiaries,
covering approximately 95,000 employees, expire April 1, 2004 through April 3, 2004.  In an agreement announced
on February 4, 2004, the CWA agreed to give us 30 days notice before taking any strike action if a settlement is
not reached by contract expiration in early April, 2004.  In turn, we agreed to continue to provide health care
benefits to employees in the event of a strike.  The largest IBEW agreement covering approximately 12,000
employees expires on June 26, 2004.

                                               RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Cingular Acquisition of AT&T Wireless

On February 17, 2004, Cingular announced an agreement to acquire AT&T Wireless.  Under the terms of the
agreement, shareholders of AT&T Wireless will receive cash of $15.00 per common share, or approximately $41
billion.  The acquisition is subject to approval by AT&T Wireless shareholders and federal regulators.  Cingular
expects to fund the acquisition with contributions from us and BellSouth.  Based on our 60% equity ownership of
Cingular, we expect to contribute approximately $25 billion of the purchase price.  We expect to pay this amount
primarily with proceeds from debt, as well as cash on hand, cash to be generated from operations and asset
sales.  Equity ownership and management control of Cingular will remain unchanged after the acquisition.

The agreement provides that if the conditions to closing are not satisfied by December 31, 2004, it may be
terminated (subject to extension to June 30, 2005 by either party) if, as of December 22, certain regulatory
approvals have not been obtained (in very limited circumstances it may be extended another 60 days thereafter).
If AT&T Wireless enters into or completes certain types of business combination transactions within fifteen
months after certain terminations of the agreement, AT&T Wireless would be obligated to pay to us and BellSouth
an aggregate termination fee equal to $1.4 billion.

The agreement also provides that Cingular and AT&T Wireless are required to use their best efforts to complete
the merger as promptly as reasonably practicable and we and BellSouth are required to use reasonable best efforts
to assist Cingular in obtaining regulatory approval.  However, none of us, BellSouth nor Cingular will be
required to take actions required by regulators as a condition to approval of the merger, and we will not be
required to close the merger if the aggregate adverse impacts of required sales of subscribers or spectrum or any
conditions imposed on any of us, BellSouth and/or Cingular would exceed $8.25 billion.  For purposes of
calculating the impacts regarding sales of subscribers or spectrum, the parties have agreed that the adverse
impact of (a) any required divestitures of a market would be equal to the number of subscribers in the market
required to be divested multiplied by $825 and (b) any required divestitures of spectrum only would be equal to
the amount of spectrum required to be divested multiplied by $.50 per MHz POP (i.e., the amount of spectrum in a
licensed area measured in MHz multiplied by the population of that licensed area).  Any other adverse impacts on
us, BellSouth and/or Cingular would be calculated at the time the conditions are imposed.  Each of us and
BellSouth has agreed not to take any action reasonably likely to prevent the closing of the merger.  In addition,
each of us and BellSouth have also agreed that prior to the termination date we will not enter into any
definitive agreement to acquire a business providing commercial mobile wireless voice and data services offered
to public on FCC licensed frequencies (other than in de minimis amounts) or take actions that at the time taken
would reasonably be expected to materially interfere with our respective abilities to make funds available to
Cingular to complete the acquisition.

Additional information on expected trends at Cingular is contained in the 2003 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners
under the heading "Operating Environment and Trends of the Business -- Cingular" beginning on page 19 and is
incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Triennial Review Order Court Proceedings

On March 2, 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit)
overturned significant portions of the FCC's unbundling rules adopted in the Triennial Review Order (TRO).  The
D.C. Circuit struck down the rules concerning mass-market unbundled switching (and therefore the UNE-P) and
high-capacity transport.  The D.C. Circuit upheld the FCC's decision not to unbundle broadband investment,
including its decision to phase out line-sharing (which allows competitors to offer high-speed internet access
on traditional copper voice lines).  The D.C. Circuit's decision will not become effective for at least 60 days
to allow the FCC and other parties to seek reconsideration or a review of the order by all judges on the D.C.
Circuit.  Since this decision struck down the FCC's delegation of authority to the state regulators to decide
whether switching and, hence the UNE-P must be made available in specified markets, it is unclear how this
decision will affect the availability of the UNE-P in our 13-state area.

California Audit

On February 26, 2004, the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) decided several major monetary issues in
the 1997-1999 audit of our California wireline subsidiary.  The CPUC ruled that we were in compliance with
regulatory accounting and pension and depreciation rules and that no refunds (i.e., service credits) were owed
by our subsidiary to customers.  The CPUC determined, however, that our withdrawal of amounts from a Voluntary
Employee Benefit Association Trust (VEBA) for active employee benefits, as opposed to retiree benefits, should
be refunded back to the VEBA, which will result in a 2004 contribution of approximately $230 million.

Antitrust Litigation

Eight consumer antitrust class actions were filed in 2003 against us in the United States District Court for the
District of Connecticut.  The primary claim in these suits was that our wireline subsidiaries, in violation of
federal and state law, maintained monopoly power over local telephone service in all 13 states in which our
subsidiaries are incumbent local exchange companies.

These cases were consolidated under the first filed case Twombly v. SBC Communications Inc. and stayed by
                                                         ----------------------------------
agreement of the parties pending the United States Supreme Court's (Supreme Court) decision in a similar case
against another incumbent local exchange company.  In that case, the Supreme Court held that violations of the
Telecom Act do not support an antitrust claim and that the plaintiff had not stated an antitrust claim and
affirmed dismissal of the plaintiff's antitrust claims. Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V.

eight consolidated consumer antitrust class action suits, thus ending that litigation.



CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Information set forth in this report contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties.  We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the
forward-looking statements:

o    Adverse economic changes in the markets served by us or in countries in which we have significant
     investments.
o    Changes in available technology and the effects of such changes including product substitutions and
     deployment costs.
o    Uncertainty in the U.S. securities market and adverse medical cost trends.
o    The final outcome of Federal Communications Commission proceedings and re-openings of such proceedings,
     including the Triennial Review and other rulemakings, and judicial review, if any, of such proceedings,
     including issues relating to access charges, availability and pricing of, unbundled network elements and
     platforms (UNE-Ps) and unbundled loop and transport elements (EELs).
o    The final outcome of state regulatory proceedings in our 13-state area and re-openings of such
     proceedings, and judicial review, if any, of such proceedings, including proceedings relating to
     interconnection terms, access charges, universal service, UNE-Ps and resale and wholesale rates, our
     broadband initiative known as Project Pronto, performance measurement plans, service standards and
     reciprocal compensation.
o    Enactment of additional state, federal and/or foreign regulatory laws and regulations pertaining to our
     subsidiaries and foreign investments.
o    Our ability to absorb revenue losses caused by UNE-P requirements and increasing competition and to
     maintain capital expenditures.
o    The extent of competition in our 13-state area and the resulting pressure on access line totals and
     wireline and wireless operating margins.
o    Our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to offset increasing
     competition in our wireline and wireless markets.
o    The ability of our competitors to offer product/service offerings at lower prices due to adverse
     regulatory decisions, including state regulatory proceedings relating to UNE-Ps and non-regulation of
     comparable alternative technologies (e.g., VoIP).
o    The outcome of current labor negotiations and its effect on operations and financial results.
o    The issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other accounting oversight bodies of new
     accounting standards or changes to existing standards.
o    The impact of the wireless joint venture with BellSouth, known as Cingular, including marketing and
     product-development efforts, customer acquisition and retention costs, access to additional spectrum,
     technological advancements, industry consolidation including the pending acquisition of AT&T Wireless and
     availability and cost of capital.
o    Cingular's failure to achieve, in the amounts and within the timeframe expected, the capital and expense
     synergies and other benefits expected from its pending acquisition of AT&T Wireless and our incremental
     costs, if any, in financing our portion of the merger's purchase price.
o    Changes in our corporate strategies, such as changing network requirements or acquisitions and
     dispositions, to respond to competition and regulatory and technology developments.

Readers are cautioned that other factors discussed in this report, although not enumerated here, also could
materially impact our future earnings.





ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

Our properties do not lend themselves to description by character and location of principal units.  At December
31, 2003, approximately 99% of our property, plant and equipment was owned by our wireline subsidiaries.  Network
access lines represented approximately 39.0% of the wireline subsidiaries' investment in telephone plant; central
office equipment represented approximately 41.5%; land and buildings represented approximately 9.1%; other
equipment, comprised principally of furniture and office equipment and vehicles and other work equipment,
represented approximately 6.7%; and other miscellaneous property represented approximately 3.7%.

Substantially all of the installations of central office equipment are located in buildings and on land that we
own.  Many garages, administrative and business offices and telephone centers are in leased quarters.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to numerous lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of
business.  In our opinion, although the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain, they should not have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Additional information
regarding litigation is included in the 2003 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading "Antitrust
Litigation" on page 29, which is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).  As of
the date of this report, we do not believe that any pending legal proceedings to which we or our subsidiaries
are subject are required to be disclosed as material legal proceedings pursuant to this item.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matter was submitted to a vote of shareowners in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)    In addition to the shares shown in the above table,  certain stock options  issued by companies  acquired by
       SBC were  converted  into  options to acquire SBC stock.  As of December  31,  2003,  there were  32,669,185
       shares of SBC common stock subject to the converted  options,  having a  weighted-average  exercise price of
       $29.04. No further grants may be issued under the assumed plans.

(2)    Included in the total are up to 4,560,559  shares that may be issued as  restricted  stock and  18,663,462
       shares  that  may be  issued  pursuant  to  performance  shares  under  the  2001  Incentive  Plan  and  its
       predecessor.

       Also  included are up to 3,456,100  shares that may be purchased  under the Stock  Savings Plan by mid-level
       and above managers through payroll  deductions,  company matching  contributions  and reinvested  dividends.
       Managers who elect to receive matching  contributions  in the 401(k) cannot receive  matching  contributions
       in this plan.  The shares  purchased are not delivered to the employee  until after  retirement,  subject to
       certain  accelerated  delivery  provisions.  Shares relating to restricted stock and performance shares from
       the 2001  Incentive Plan may also be deferred  under the Stock Savings Plan (but without  matching  shares).
       In addition,  managers  receive 2 options for every share purchased with employee  payroll  deductions.  The
       options  have a 10 year term and a strike  price equal to the fair market  value of the stock on the date of
       grant.  There are  9,473,452  shares  available  under the plan for future  issuances of options.  The Stock
       Savings Plan was  approved by  shareowners  in 1994.  The plan was amended by the Board of Directors in 2000
       to increase the number of shares  available for purchase under the plan  (including  shares from the company
       match and  reinvested  dividend  equivalents)  and shares  subject to options by 8,000,000  and  13,000,000,
       respectively.  The amounts shown for approved plans in columns (a) and (c) include these additional  shares.
       Shareowner approval was not required or obtained for the amendment.

(3)    Plans that have not been  approved  by  shareowners  include  the 1995  Management  Stock  Option Plan (1995
       Plan),  2001 Stock Option Grant to Bargained-for and Certain Other Employees  (Bargained-For  Plan), and the
       Non-Employee  Director  Stock  and  Deferral  Plan  (Non-Employee  Director  Plan).  The  1995  Plan and the
       Bargained-For  Plan  provide  for  grants of stock  options  to  management  employees  (10 year  terms) and
       Bargained-For  employees  (5 year terms),  respectively,  subject in each case to vesting  requirements  and
       shortened   exercise  terms  upon  termination  of  employment.   Under  the  Non-Employee   Director  Plan,
       participants  may  elect  to  receive  stock  units  in  lieu of  retainers  and  fees.  In  addition,  each
       non-employee  director  receives an annual award of stock units equal in value to one and one-half times the
       annual  retainer.  Directors who become board members after November 21, 1997,  also receive up to 10 annual
       grants of stock  units  equal to $13,000  each.  The stock  units are paid out in the form of SBC stock only
       after the termination of the employment of a director.  Under the plan,  555,980 shares remain available for
       future issuance and are included in the table.
