PART I

ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

GENERAL

SBC Communications Inc.
(SBC) is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
in 1983 and has its principal executive offices at 175 E. Houston,
San Antonio, Texas 78205-2233 (telephone number 210-821-4105). SBC
maintains an internet site at http://www.sbc.com. (This web site address is for
information only and is not intended to be an active link or to incorporate any
web site information into this document.) We make available, free of charge, on
our website our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,
current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as
reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the SEC.

Throughout this document
SBC is referred to as “we” or “SBC”.

History

SBC was formed as one of several
regional holding companies created to hold AT&T Corp.‘s (AT&T)
local telephone companies. On January 1, 1984, SBC was spun-off from AT&T
pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent publicly
traded telecommunications services provider. At formation, we primarily operated
in five southwestern states. SBC subsidiaries merged with Pacific Telesis Group
(PAC) in 1997, Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation (SNET) in
1998 and Ameritech Corporation (Ameritech) in 1999, thereby expanding our
wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier into a total of 13
states. Our services and products have been marketed under several brands
including SBC Ameritech, SBC Nevada Bell, SBC Pacific Bell, SBC SNET, SBC
Southwestern Bell, and, through our joint venture with BellSouth Corporation
(BellSouth), Cingular Wireless (Cingular). In December 2002, in order to further
establish the public’s awareness of SBC as a national telecommunications
provider, we moved our regional SBC brands to a single brand, SBC, for all
states except Connecticut.

Scope

We rank among the largest
providers of telecommunications services in the United States and the world.
Through our subsidiaries, we provide communications services and products in the
United States and have investments in more than 25 countries. We offer our
services and products to businesses and consumers, as well as other providers of
telecommunications services.

The services and products
that we offer vary by market, and include: local exchange services, wireless
communications, long-distance services, internet services, telecommunications
equipment, and directory advertising and publishing. We group our operating
subsidiaries as follows, corresponding to our operating segments for financial
reporting purposes:

wireline subsidiaries provide primarily land and wire based services,

wireless subsidiaries hold our investment in Cingular, which provides primarily radio wave based
services,

directory subsidiaries provide services related to directory
advertising and publishing,

international subsidiaries hold investments in
primarily foreign entities outside of the United States, and

other subsidiaries provide corporate operations, and prior to 2001, primarily provided
security monitoring and cable television services.

Our principal wireline
subsidiaries provide telecommunications services in thirteen states: California,
Texas, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, Connecticut, Indiana, Wisconsin,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas and Nevada (13-state area). Wireline local exchange
services offered in the 13-state area are provided through regulated
subsidiaries which operate within authorized regions (in-region) subject to
regulation by each state in which they operate and by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC). Additional information relating to regulation is contained
under the heading “Government Regulation” below and in the 2002 SBC
Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading “Operating Environment and
Trends of the Business”, and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant
to General Instruction G(2).

InterLATA Long-distance

We offer landline interLATA
(traditional) long-distance services to customers in selected areas outside our
wireline subsidiaries’ operating areas. Further, we offer interLATA
wireline long-distance services to customers in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Missouri, California and Connecticut. In December 2002, the Public
Utilities Commission of Nevada approved our Nevada wireline subsidiary’s
application to enter the interLATA long-distance market in Nevada and we filed
for approval from the FCC on January 14, 2003. In January 2003, the Michigan
Public Service Commission approved our Michigan wireline subsidiary’s
application to enter the interLATA long-distance market in Michigan and we filed
for approval from the FCC on January 16, 2003. The FCC must issue its decision
within 90 days of our filings, if it deems our filings complete. Finally, we
continue to seek long-distance approval in our other remaining in-region states
and have filed applications with state commissions in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio
and Wisconsin.

Broadband Initiative

In October 1999, we
announced plans to upgrade our network to make broadband services available to
approximately 80% of our U.S. wireline customers over the four years through
2003 (Project Pronto). Due to the weakening U.S. economy and an adverse
regulatory environment, in October 2001 we announced a scale-back in our
broadband deployment plans. Specifically, burdensome FCC and state commission
regulations regarding our DSL network have added significantly to our costs and
delayed our ability to earn a profit on DSL service. Our cable modem competitors
are not subject to these regulations. This adverse regulatory environment was
the primary reason we decided to slow the build-out of our broadband network. We
expect to spend significantly less on capital expenditures due to this
scale-back. Despite this scale-back, our DSL lines continue to grow and were
approximately 2,199,000 at December 31, 2002 compared to 1,333,000 at the end of
2001 and we expect DSL to achieve profitability in early 2004. Our addressable
broadband market included 66% of our consumer and small business locations at
December 31, 2002.

The FCC began its review of
the rules for the provision of domestic broadband services by incumbent local
carriers or their affiliates in December 2001. The FCC is reviewing broadband
services offered over cable, satellite and wireless platforms in addition to
traditional wireline offerings. In February 2002, the FCC issued a notice of
proposed rulemaking tentatively concluding that wireline broadband access
services are information services rather than telecommunications services, which
would result in less regulation. The FCC also is considering eliminating the
requirement that wireline telephone companies provide the transmission component
of broadband internet access services as stand-alone telecommunications services
and whether it should adopt an alternative broadband access requirement for
internet service providers. Cable operators have no obligation to provide
third-party internet service providers access to their broadband networks at
this time, although the FCC has initiated a proceeding to consider the issue.

In December 2002, the FCC
ruled that advanced services, such as DSL, provided through one of our advanced
services subsidiaries, are not subject to tariff regulations and cost study
requirements. However, we are still required to retain cost data and offer our
retail advanced services for resale at a discount. This ruling should allow us
to respond more quickly to offerings by unregulated competitors. The FCC is
expected to complete its broadband review in mid-2003 and the effect of the
review on our results of operations and financial position cannot be determined
at this time. In a separate proceeding, the FCC addressed other broadband
issues; see “FCC Triennial Review” in “Recent Developments”
below.

Wireless

Cingular, our wireless
joint venture with BellSouth, began operations in October 2000. Cingular serves
approximately 22 million wireless cellular and PCS subscribers and is the
second-largest provider of mobile wireless voice and data communications
services in the United States, based on the number of wireless subscribers.
Cingular has access to licenses to provide cellular or PCS wireless
communications services covering an aggregate population of potential
subscribers, referred to as “POPs”, of approximately 231 million, or
approximately 81% of the U.S. population, including 45 of the 50 largest U.S.
metropolitan areas.

Cingular’s priorities
for 2003 include promotion of the Cingular brand to expand its customer base
profitably; continued realization of revenue and cost synergies offered by its
formation; increasing the capacity, speed and functionality of its network
through the continued rollout of wireless data services by overlaying Global
System for Mobile Communications (GSM) voice, which is the standard digital
cellular phone technology used in Europe and other countries around the world,
and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) high-speed data technology over its
existing networks; development and promotion of advanced wireless data
applications over multiple communications devices; and continued expansion of
its existing footprint and network capacity by obtaining access to additional
spectrum, primarily through spectrum exchanges, purchases, mergers or
acquisitions.

BUSINESS OPERATIONS

Operating Segments

Our segments are strategic
business units that offer different products and services and are managed
accordingly. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP), our operating segment results follow our internal management reporting.
We evaluate performance based on income before income taxes adjusted for special
items. We have five reportable segments that reflect the current management of
our business: (1) wireline; (2) wireless; (3) directory; (4) international; and
(5) other.

Additional information
about our segments, including financial information and special items, is
included under the heading “Segment Results” on pages 9 through 17 and
in Note 4 of the 2002 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners and is incorporated
herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Wireline

Wireline is our largest
operating segment, providing approximately 74% of 2002 revenues from all our
segments. Our wireline segment operates as both a retail and wholesale seller of
communication services. We provide landline telecommunications services,
including local, network access, data, long-distance services, internet
services, and customer premises and private branch exchange (PBX) equipment. Our
landline telecommunications subsidiaries serve approximately 31.4 million retail
consumer, 19.5 million retail business, 5.7 million wholesale and 0.5 million
other access lines, for a total of 57.1 million access lines in our 13-state
area.

Services and Products

We divide our wireline
services into four product-based categories – voice, data, long-distance
and other.

Voice

- Voice includes
traditional local service provided to retail customers and wholesale access to
our network and individual network elements provided to competitors. Voice also
includes vertical services (described below), fees to maintain wire located
inside customer premises, pay telephones, and other miscellaneous voice
products.

Vertical services are
enhanced telephone services available to retail customers such as Caller ID,
Call Waiting, and voice mail. Customers that subscribe to these services can
have the number and/or name of callers displayed on their phone, be signaled
that additional calls are incoming, and send and receive voice messages. These
services are not regulated by the FCC and are generally more profitable than
basic local phone service.

Data

- Data includes
traditional products, such as switched and dedicated transport, internet access
and network integration, and data equipment sales.

Switched Transport services
transmit data using switching equipment to transfer the data between multiple
lines before reaching its destination. Dedicated Transport services use a single
direct line to transmit data between destinations. Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN), Dedicated Frame Relay, DSL, Digital Services and Synchronous
Optical Network (SONET) are examples of Dedicated Transport services. ISDN
transmits voice, video, and data over a single line in support of a wide range
of applications, including internet access. Frame Relay is a routing technology
that breaks a data signal into individual pieces of data to travel at high
speeds and then recombines the data prior to arriving at its destination. DSL is
a digital modem technology that converts existing twisted-pair telephone lines
into access paths for multimedia and high-speed data communications to the
Internet or private networks. DSL allows customers to simultaneously make a
phone call and access information via the Internet or an office local area
network. Digital Services use dedicated digital circuits to transmit digital
data at various high rates of speed. SONET provides customer access to our
backbone network at various high speeds.

Network integration
services include installation of business data systems, local area networking,
and other data networking offerings. Internet access services include a wide
range of products for residences and businesses, varying by market. Internet
services offered include basic dial-up access service, dedicated access, web
hosting, e-mail, and high-speed access services.

Prodigy Acquisition

During 2000, we formed a
relationship with Prodigy Communications Corporation (Prodigy) that combined our
residential and small business internet operations. In the fourth quarter of
2001, we acquired Prodigy. Additional financial information on the Prodigy
acquisition is contained in Note 2 of the 2002 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners
and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Yahoo! Alliance

In November 2001, we formed
a strategic alliance with Yahoo! to provide co-branded broadband and dial-up
service to residential customers nationwide. SBC and Yahoo! expanded the
alliance in April 2002 to include co-branded broadband and dial-up services
designed for small businesses. During the second quarter of 2002, the companies
launched SBC Yahoo! Dial - a national dial-up internet service for residential
users. During the third quarter, the companies launched SBC Yahoo! DSL for
residential customers in SBC’s 13-state region. SBC and Yahoo! plan to
launch co-branded services for small businesses in 2003.

Cisco Agreement

In December 2002, we formed
a strategic marketing and sales agreement with Cisco Systems Inc. (Cisco) to
provide business services that will combine Cisco’s equipment and our
transport and integration services. We also intend to use select Cisco
technology in our network infrastructure to deliver new services. Customers will
be able to cost-effectively outsource these business services and SBC service
centers will serve as a single point of contact.

Long-distance voice

-
Long-distance voice consists of all interLATA (traditional long-distance) and
intraLATA (local toll) wireline revenues, including calling card and 1-800
services. Federal regulation prohibits us from providing interLATA wireline
long-distance services in six of our 13 in-region states. We provide interLATA
wireline long-distance to our customers in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Missouri, California and Connecticut. In addition, since 1996, we have offered
interLATA wireline long-distance services to customers in selected areas outside
our 13-state region.

Other

- Customer premises
equipment and other equipment sales range from single-line and cordless
telephones to sophisticated digital PBX systems. PBX is a private telephone
switching system, typically used by businesses and usually located on a
customer’s premises, which provides intra-premise telephone services as
well as access to our network.

Wireless

Our wireless segment
provides domestic wireless telecommunications services, including local,
long-distance and roaming services. Wireless services and products offered also
include certain enhanced services, paging services and wireless equipment. Due
to the contribution of substantially all of our domestic wireless operations to
Cingular (discussed below), reported operating revenues and expenses do not
include revenues or expenses from Cingular; instead we reflect our 60% share of
its net income as equity in net income of affiliates. Consequently, on a
reported basis, our Wireless segment had no operating revenues.

While our reported
operating revenues do not include Cingular’s results, we do include 60% of
Cingular’s revenues and expenses (which equals our economic ownership
percentage) when we analyze our operating segment results. On that segment
basis, the wireless segment provided approximately 17% of 2002 revenues from all
our segments.

Cingular Wireless Joint Venture

In April 2000, we formed a
joint venture with BellSouth to provide domestic wireless services nationally.
In October 2000, most of our and BellSouth’s wireless operations were
contributed to Cingular, which then began operations. Economic ownership in
Cingular is held 60% by us and 40% by BellSouth. We have equal voting rights and
representation on the board of directors that controls Cingular. Because we
share control equally, we use the equity method of accounting to account for our
interest.

Cingular faces substantial
competition in all aspects of its business as competition continues to increase
in the wireless communications industry. Under current FCC rules, six or more
PCS licensees, two cellular licensees and one or more enhanced specialized
mobile radio licensees may operate in each of Cingular’s markets. On
average, Cingular has four to five other wireless competitors in each of its
markets and competes for customers based principally on price, service
offerings, call quality, coverage area and customer service.

Cingular’s competitors
are principally five national (Verizon Wireless, AT&T Wireless, Sprint PCS,
Nextel Communications and T-Mobile) and a larger number of regional providers of
cellular, PCS and other wireless communications services. Cingular also competes
with resellers and wireline service providers. Moreover, Cingular may experience
significant competition from companies that provide similar services using other
communications technologies and services. While some of these technologies and
services are now operational, others are being developed or may be developed in
the future.

Additional information on
Cingular is contained in the 2002 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners under the
heading “Expected Growth Areas - Wireless” beginning on page 19 and is
incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Directory

Our directory segment
includes advertising, Yellow and White Pages directories and electronic
publishing. The directory segment provided approximately 9% of 2002 revenues
from all our segments. Our directory subsidiaries operate primarily in our
13-state region.

International

Our international segment
includes all of our investments with primarily international operations. We have
direct or indirect interests in businesses located in more than 25 countries and
as of December 31, 2002, have international investments with a carrying value of
approximately $7 billion (including approximately $700 million for our interest
in Cegetel, which we sold in January 2003 for approximately $2.3 billion, and
approximately $300 million in marketable equity securities of BCE, Inc.(BCE).)
Our international investments include local and long-distance telephone
services, wireless communications, voice messaging, data services, video
services, internet access, telecommunications equipment, and directory
publishing. We report earnings from this segment as equity in net income of
affiliates rather than as operating revenue because this segment consists almost
exclusively of equity investments rather than direct operations. Revenues from
our international segment are less than 1% of 2002 revenues from all our
segments.

We describe below our
foreign equity investments and significant transactions relating to these
investments. Financial information about this segment is included in Note 6 of
the 2002 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners and is incorporated herein by
reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Europe

We hold a 41.6% stake in
TDC A/S (TDC), Denmark’s primary full-service communications operator. TDC
has investments in full service communications providers in Switzerland with a
78.5% investment in Sunrise, and in Belgium with a 16.5% investment in Belgacom
S.A. (Belgacom). TDC has investments in wireless services in the Ukraine,
Lithuania, Poland, Austria and Germany. TDC also has investments in
communications providers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Finland, Norway and
Sweden. We have the right to elect six of twelve members of the TDC Board of
Directors, including the Chairman, who would cast any tie-breaking vote.

In January 2001, TDC
acquired a majority interest in diAx A.G (diAx), a wireless and long-distance
provider in Switzerland owned by SBC International and diAx Holdings. In the
first quarter of 2003, TDC acquired the remaining shares from diAx Holdings,
pursuant to an agreement negotiated at the time of the original transaction.

In Belgium, we hold a 17.5%
stake in Belgacom, that country’s primary full-service telecommunications
operator, and effectively own 24.4% of Belgacom when our direct stake is
combined with the stake we hold indirectly through TDC. With approximately 4.7
million access lines and more than 3.5 million cellular customers, Belgacom
provides local, long-distance, cellular and other communications services and
offers directories and security services. During 2001, Belgacom entered into an
agreement with an unaffiliated special purpose entity (SPE) that allowed
Belgacom, at its discretion, the option to sell portions of its Netherlands
wireless operations to the SPE in unspecified amounts until the end of 2002. The
SPE had the right to put the investment to a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom.
During 2002, Deutsche Telekom issued an irrevocable call option notice calling
all shares of the Netherlands wireless operations that were held by Belgacom and
TDC. The transaction closed in September 2002.

In 2002, we agreed to sell
to Vodafone Group PLC (Vodafone) our 15% equity interest in Cegetel S.A.
(Cegetel), a joint venture that owns 80% of the second-largest wireless provider
in France. The transaction closed in January 2003. Additional information on
this transaction is contained in Note 2 of the 2002 SBC Annual Report to
Shareowners and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General
Instruction G(2).

North America

In the second quarter of
2002, we entered into two agreements with Bell Canada Holdings Inc. (Bell
Canada): (1) to redeem a portion of our ownership in Bell Canada, representing
approximately 4% of the company and (2) an agreement that gave BCE the right to
purchase our remaining interest in Bell Canada, representing approximately 16%
of the company, during the fourth quarter of 2002. Bell Canada redeemed our 4%
interest in the second quarter of 2002. BCE exercised its right to purchase our
remaining 16% interest in Bell Canada during the fourth quarter of 2002.
Additional information on these transactions is contained in Note 2 of the 2002
SBC Annual Report to Shareowners and is incorporated herein by reference
pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

We own a 7.6% equity share
in Teléfonos de México, S.A. de C.V. (Telmex), Mexico’s largest
national telecommunications provider of wireline services. Telmex operates
approximately 14.5 million access lines. Through our relationship, we have
worked with Telmex to develop an advanced network, and have helped Telmex
achieve its goal of providing enhanced telephone service throughout Mexico.

We are a member of a
consortium that holds all of the class AA shares of Telmex stock, representing
voting control of the company. Another member of the consortium, Carso Global
Telecom, S.A. de C.V. (Carso), has the right to appoint a majority of the
directors of Telmex.

In February 2002, U.S.
trade officials announced that they would formally ask for a World Trade
Organization (WTO) panel to investigate the allegation that Mexico has unfairly
kept U.S. companies from competing in its $12 billion telecommunications market.
U.S. trade officials requested the WTO create a Dispute Settlement Board in
April 2002 and the WTO completed the panel selection in July 2002. Telmex
expects that the panel findings will be made final and published in July 2003.

As of December 31, 2002,
Telmex had approximately 70% of the long-distance market in Mexico.
Telmex’s share of international long-distance traffic may decline
significantly when the proportional return mechanism expires. This mechanism
guarantees Telmex the same percentage of incoming traffic as outgoing traffic.
In 2002, Telmex and its competitors agreed to eliminate the proportional return
mechanism and agreed on new settlement rates based on the point of destination
or origination of the call. These rates will be in effect until January 2004,
when the proportional return mechanism expires.

In 2000, Telmex spun-off
its wireless and certain other operations to its shareowners as a separate
business, América Móvil S.A. de C.V. (América Móvil), which
serves more than 30 million wireless customers. We own a 7.6% interest in
América Móvil.

We are a member of a
consortium that holds all of the class AA shares of América Móvil
stock, representing voting control of the company. Another member of the
consortium, Carso, had the right to appoint a majority of the directors of
América Móvil. In January 2002, Carso transferred its ownership
interest in América Móvil to Americas Telecom S.A. de C.V., and with
that the right to appoint a majority of the directors of América
Móvil.

South America

In January 2002, we
purchased from América Móvil its approximately 50% of Cellular
Communications of Puerto Rico (CCPR) for cash and a note redeemable for our
investment in Telecom Americas. We retained the right to settle the note by
delivering Telecom Americas shares. This represented a forward sale of our
interest in Telecom Americas. In connection with this transaction, we reviewed
the values at which we would carry CCPR and our interest in Telecom Americas and
recognized a charge of $390 million ($262 million net of tax) for the reduction
of our direct and indirect book values to the value indicated by the
transaction. We based this valuation on a contemporaneous transaction involving
CCPR and an independent third party. The charges were recorded in both other
income (expense) – net $(341) million and equity in net income of
affiliates $(49) million. América Móvil exercised its option to
acquire our shares of Telecom Americas in July 2002.

Africa/Middle East

We hold an 18% indirect
ownership stake in Telkom S.A. Limited (Telkom), South Africa’s largest
local exchange and long-distance company. Currently, Telkom serves nearly 5.0
million access lines in South Africa, and also owns 50% of a second national
wireless network serving more than 7.3 million wireless customers through
Telkom’s wireless subsidiary, Vodacom.

We own a 9% stake in Amdocs
Limited (Amdocs), a major supplier of billing and customer service software used
by telecommunications companies worldwide. Amdocs, a Guernsey Island
corporation, has operations throughout the world with many of its programming
support services located in Israel.

MAJOR CLASSES OF SERVICE

The following table sets
forth the percentage of consolidated total reported operating revenues by any
class of service that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated total
operating revenues in any of the last three fiscal years.

Percentage of Consolidated Total

Reported Operating Revenues





Approximately 96%, 96% and 95% of directory advertising revenues were recorded
in the Directory segment for 2002, 2001 and 2000. The remaining directory
advertising revenues were recorded in the Wireline segment.

Voice and Data are included
in the Wireline segment and each also exceeds 10% of the wireline segment’s
total operating revenues. Beginning in 2001, all of our wireless segment
revenues are reported in equity in net income of affiliates in our consolidated
financial statements because they are generated by Cingular. Directory
advertising revenues are included in our directory segment’s results of
operations and are approximately 97% of directory’s total operating
revenues.

We analyze our wireless
segment’s results by including 60% of Cingular’s revenues and
expenses, an amount that equals our economic ownership percentage. The below
table shows the effect on our other classes of services (shown in the above
table) if 60% of Cingular’s revenues are added to our total operating
revenues.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

In our 13-state area, our
wireline subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state commissions which have
the power to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local,
long-distance and network access services. Our wireline subsidiaries are also
subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to interstate and
international rates and services, including interstate access charges. Access
charges are designed to compensate our wireline subsidiaries for the use of
their network by other carriers.

Additional information
relating to federal and state regulation of our wireline subsidiaries is
contained in the 2002 SBC Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading
“Regulatory Developments” beginning on page 20, and is incorporated
herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

IMPORTANCE, DURATION AND EFFECT OF LICENSES

Certain of our subsidiaries
own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks and other

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

FCC Triennial Review

On
February 20, 2003, the FCC, in its Triennial Review proceeding, issued a press
release describing general rules it approved concerning the obligations of
incumbent local exchange carriers, such as our wireline subsidiaries, to make
available network elements on an unbundled and subsidized basis. These rules
will replace the FCC’s previous unbundling rules, which have been vacated
by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Court
of Appeals). The FCC did not release a text of its decision prior to the filing
of this Form 10-K and public information about the FCC’s ruling is somewhat
limited. Additional information about the order and its implications for SBC
will be known once the text of the decision is released. Set forth below is a
summary of what we now know about the decision.

The Triennial Review
decision, rather than establishing a uniform national structure for unbundled
network elements (UNEs) as mandated by the D.C. Court of Appeals in May 2002,
largely defers decisions on UNEs to the states, including rules for below-cost
unbundled network element-platform (UNE-P). The FCC is also revising rules
regarding combinations of unbundled loop and dedicated transport elements.
(“Impairment”, when used below, has been defined by the FCC to mean an
economic or operational barrier(s) to providing service; this term should not be
confused with the GAAP term “impairment” used in a financial context
in certain sections of our Annual Report.)

UNE-P

UNE-P is a combination of all of the network elements necessary to provide
complete local service to a customer. To the extent that any one of those
network elements is not required, the UNE-P itself cannot be required. From a
practical perspective, the network element most relevant to the UNE-P is
“switching”, i.e., the routing of telephone calls or data. In its
decision, the FCC declined to reach any definitive conclusions with regard to
the switching element, instead leaving to each state to determine the extent, if
any, to which unbundled switching must be provided. The FCC did, however,
establish certain presumptions in this regard. Specifically, it presumed that
competitors are not “impaired” in their ability to serve larger
business customers (those using a high capacity loop facility) without access to
unbundled switching. It presumed that competitors are “impaired” in
their ability to serve other customers. The decision purportedly will set forth
specific criteria that each state commission may apply to determine, on a
“granular” basis, whether impairment actually exists in a particular
market. The state commissions will have three months to overcome the presumption
of a lack of impairment for larger business customers. They are given nine
months to complete the “granular” analysis for other customers. If the
analysis concludes that impairment does not exist, there will be a three-year
transition period off below-cost UNE-P, but the FCC did not offer any further
details about that transition.

Dedicated Transport

The FCC redefines dedicated transport to include only those
transmission facilities connecting incumbents’ switches or central offices,
thus eliminating unbundling of entrance facilities (connections between the
incumbent and competitor networks). The FCC concludes that competitive local
exchange carriers are considered impaired if they do not have access to dark
fiber (unused fiber that must be equipped with electronics before it can
transmit a communications signal) and DS3 and DS1 capacity transport, except
where alternative wholesale facilities are available. State commissions are to
perform route-specific, “granular” analysis to determine if such
alternative wholesale facilities exist for each of these services. Dark fiber
and DS3 transport are also each subject to review by the state commissions to
identify whether competing carriers are able to provide their own facilities. If
state analysis determines that there is no impairment, incumbents will not be
required to provide below-cost data transport services. (Data transport
services, also referred to as “special access” services are a
component of our wireline revenues.)

Enhanced Extended Links (EELs)

Incumbent local exchange carriers, such as our
wireline subsidiaries, are currently required to provide combinations of
unbundled loop and transport elements, i.e., EELs, to carriers that are using
such combinations to provide a significant amount of local service. The
Triennial Review decision apparently revises the test for determining when the
“significant local service” test has been met. While the details of
the new test have not been released, we do know that the decision eliminates the
existing restriction on “commingling” UNEs with access services. The
ability to order new combinations means that competitors, in some cases, can
order unbundled loop and transport combinations without having first ordered
them as special access services and then converting them to UNEs.

Broadband

The Triennial Review decision, as described in the FCC’s press
release, eliminates unbundling of certain telecommunications technology that is
primarily used for transmitting data and high-speed internet access across
telephone lines. For example, it eliminates unbundling of the packet-switching
capabilities (a highly efficient method of transmitting data) of
incumbents’ local loops and eliminates unbundling of certain
fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) loops. FTTH loops are fiber-optic loops that connect
directly from carriers’ networks to customers’ premises. Traditional
telephone lines are copper; fiber-optic lines are made of glass and can carry
more information over far longer distances than copper. Under the new FCC rules,
packet-switching and FTTH loops are not considered UNEs; therefore, our wireline
subsidiaries will not be required to sell them to competitors at below-cost UNE
prices. However, incumbents must continue to provide unbundled access to
copper-loop and sub-loop lines and in areas where unregulated fiber-optic lines
are installed in place of copper-loop lines, incumbents will be required to
provide “narrowband service” (to be clarified in the decision text)
unbundled access over the fiber-optic lines. Additionally, incumbents may face
constraints on retiring copper-loop or sub-loop lines without prior state
regulatory approval. Although our evaluation of this requirement depends on the
scope and implementation standards included in the text of the FCC’s
decision, continued operation of copper lines that we would otherwise have
retired may increase our future expenses and require us to reduce our future
capital expenditure budget.

Under
the FCC’s Line Sharing Order, incumbents, such as our wireline
subsidiaries, were required to share, on an unbundled basis, the high-frequency
portion of the local telephone lines with competitors so that competitors could
offer DSL services on a national basis. As set forth in the FCC’s press
release, under the Triennial Review decision, this high-frequency portion of the
telephone line is no longer considered a UNE. During a three-year period,
competitive carriers will be required to pay an increasing amount for the
services and transition existing customers to new arrangements.

UNE Pricing Rules

The decision apparently clarifies two components of the FCC
UNE-pricing rules that govern the rates incumbents, such as our wireline
subsidiaries, charge competitors for interconnection and leasing portions of the
incumbents’ telephone networks. First, it recommends that the cost of
capital used in calculating UNE prices should reflect the risks associated with
a competitive market; and second, it states that that the use of accelerated
depreciation may present a more accurate measure of calculating economic
depreciation. It appears that much of this portion of the decision consists of
suggestions rather than mandates and it is not clear the extent to which the
states will adhere to these guidelines; therefore, the effects of this portion
of the decision on our financial position and results of operations are
uncertain at this time.

Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPR)

The Triennial Review decision opens
a FNPR to seek comment on whether the FCC should modify its
“pick-and-choose” rule that permits requesting competitive carriers to
opt into individual portions of interconnection agreements without accepting all
the terms and conditions of the agreements.

Due to the lack of detailed
information about the new rules in the FCC’s press release, we cannot
analyze or quantify the effects of this decision until we review the text of the
decision; however, the new unbundling rules will most likely create an even more
uncertain and more complex regulatory environment for our wireline subsidiaries,
possibly resulting in further reductions in capital expenditures and employment
levels. As the new rules give each state commission the authority to determine
which network elements are to be unbundled and to set UNE-P rules, the rules
will likely vary by state as well as be subject to implementation and federal
appeal on a state-by-state basis rather than uniform implementation and review
at the federal level. Furthermore, several of the new rules, including the
FCC’s finding of presumed impairment for switching, or UNE-P, appear
legally suspect. The D.C. Court of Appeals, in vacating the FCC’s UNE
Remand Order, mandated that the FCC apply a meaningful impairment standard when
evaluating UNEs. However, in the Triennial Review decision, the FCC has provided
rules that force incumbents to provide core facilities (i.e., switching and
UNE-P) to competitors for at least another four years without any finding that
competitors would be impaired without such facilities. Although some relief
appears to have been provided by the broadband provisions of the FCC’s
Triennial Review decision, the decision may create increased uncertainty and we
expect that the decision may have an overall unfavorable effect on our results
of operations and financial position. We will provide further information, as it
becomes available, in our 2003 Forms 10-Q. The Triennial Review decision is
expected to be effective 30 days after official publication and likely will be
appealed by various parties.

CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Information set forth in
this report contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking
statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The following factors could
cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the
forward-looking statements:

Adverse economic changes
in the markets served by SBC or in countries in which SBC has significant
investments.

Changes in available technology and the effects of such changes
including product substitutions and deployment costs.

Continued weakness in
the U.S. securities market and adverse medical cost trends.

The final outcome
of Federal Communications Commission proceedings, including the Triennial Review
and other rulemakings, and
judicial review, if any, of such proceedings, including issues relating to
jurisdiction, unbundled network elements and platforms (UNE-Ps) and unbundled
loop and transport elements (EELs).

The final outcome of state regulatory proceedings in SBC’s 13-state area,
and judicial review, if any, of such proceedings, including proceedings relating
to interconnection terms, access charges, universal service, UNE-Ps and resale
rates, SBC’s broadband initiative known as Project Pronto, service
standards and reciprocal compensation.

Enactment of additional state, federal and/or foreign regulatory laws and
regulations pertaining to our subsidiaries and foreign investments.

Our ability to absorb
revenue losses caused by UNE-P requirements and maintain capital expenditures.

The timing of entry and the extent of competition in the local and intraLATA
toll markets in SBC’s 13-state area and the resulting pressure on access line totals and operating margins.

Our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to
offset increasing competition in our wireline and wireless markets.

The ability of our competitors to offer product/service offerings at lower
prices due to adverse regulatory decisions, including state regulatory
proceedings relating to UNE-Ps.

Additional delays in our
entry into the in-region long-distance market.

The issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other accounting
oversight bodies of new accounting standards or changes to existing standards.

The impact of the Ameritech transaction, including performance with respect to
regulatory requirements, and merger integration efforts.

The timing, extent and cost of deployment of Project Pronto, its effect on the
carrying value of the existing wireline network and the level of consumer demand
for offered services.

The impact of the wireless joint venture with BellSouth, known as Cingular,
including marketing and product-development efforts, access to additional
spectrum, technological advancements and financial capacity.

Decisions by federal and
state regulators and courts relating to bankruptcies of industry participants.

Readers are cautioned that other
factors discussed in this report, although not enumerated here, also could
materially impact our future earnings.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

Our properties do not lend
themselves to description by character and location of principal units. At
December 31, 2002, approximately 99% of our property, plant and equipment was
owned by our wireline subsidiaries. Network access lines represented
approximately 39% of the wireline subsidiaries’ investment in telephone
plant; central office equipment represented approximately 42%; land and
buildings represented approximately 9%; other equipment, comprised principally
of furniture and office equipment and vehicles and other work equipment,
represented approximately 7%; and other miscellaneous property represented
approximately 3%.

Substantially all of the
installations of central office equipment are located in buildings and on land
that we own. Many garages, administrative and business offices and telephone
centers are in leased quarters.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to numerous
lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary
course of business. In our opinion, although the outcomes of these proceedings
are uncertain, they should not have a material adverse effect on the
company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of
the date of this report, we do not believe that any pending legal proceedings to
which we or our subsidiaries are subject are required to be disclosed as
material legal proceedings pursuant to this item.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matter was submitted to
a vote of shareowners in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this

(1)

In addition to the shares shown in the above table, certain stock options issued by companies acquired by SBC were converted into
options to acquire SBC stock.  As of December 31, 2002, there were 35,845,941 shares of SBC common stock subject to the converted
options, having a weighted-average exercise price of $28.28.  No further grants may be issued under the assumed plans.

(2)

Included in the total are up to 5,959,100 shares that may be issued as restricted stock and 18,000,000 shares that may be
         issued pursuant to performance shares under the 2001 Incentive Plan.

Also included are up to 7,383,167 shares that may be purchased under the Stock Savings Plan (a deferred compensation and stock option
plan) by mid-level and above managers through payroll deductions, together with limited matching shares for managers who do not
receive matching contributions in the 401(k) plan and shares issuable upon reinvestment of dividend equivalents.  The shares
purchased are not delivered to the employee until after retirement, subject to certain accelerated delivery provisions.  Shares
relating to restricted stock and performance shares from the 2001 Incentive Plan may also be deferred under the Stock Savings Plan
(but without matching shares and stock options).  Pending delivery of the deferred shares, the managers earn dividend equivalents
that are reinvested in additional Shares.  The Stock Savings Plan also has a stock option component, for which 13,278,154 shares are
included in the table for future issuance.  For each share purchased with payroll deductions, the manager receives approximately two
such stock options, each having a term of ten years, which may be limited upon termination of employment.  The Stock Savings Plan was
approved by shareowners in 1994.  The plan was amended in 2000 to increase the number of shares available for purchase under the plan
(including shares from the company match and reinvested dividend equivalents) and shares subject to options by 8,000,000 and
13,000,000, respectively.  The amounts shown for approved plans in columns (a) and (c) include these additional shares.  Shareowner
approval was not required or obtained for the amendment.

(3)

Plans that have not been approved by shareowners include the 1995 Management Stock Option Plan (1995 Plan), 2001 Stock Option Grant
to Bargained-for and Certain Other Employees (Bargained-For Plan), and the Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferral Plan
(Non-Employee Director Plan). The 1995 Plan and the Bargained-For Plan provide for grants of stock options to management employees
(10 year terms) and Bargained-For employees (5 year terms), respectively, subject in each case to vesting requirements and shortened
exercise terms upon termination of employment.  Under the Non-Employee Director Plan, participants may elect to receive stock units
in lieu of retainers and fees.  In addition, each non-employee director receives an annual award of stock units equal in value to one
and one-half times the annual retainer. Directors who become board members after November 21, 1997, also receive up to 10 annual
grants of stock units equal to $13,000 each.  The stock units are paid out in the form of SBC stock only after the termination of the
employment of a director.  Under the plan, 672,080 shares remain available under the plan and are included in the table.

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

Information required by this Item is included in the registrant’s definitive proxy statement, dated on or about March 14, 2003, under
the heading “Compensation of Directors” from page 13 through page 14 and “Contracts with Management” from page 37 through page 40,
which are incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(3).

ITEM 14.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
rules and forms.  The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of March 14, 2003.  Based on that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
March 14, 2003.  There have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect internal controls subsequent to March 14, 2003.
