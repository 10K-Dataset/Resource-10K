ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

AT&T Inc. (“AT&T,” “we” or the “Company”) is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1983 and has its principal executive offices at 175 E. Houston, San Antonio, Texas 78205-2233 (telephone number 210-821-4105).  We maintain an Internet website at www.att.com.  (This website address is for information only and is not intended to be an active link or to incorporate any website information into this document.)  We make available, free of charge, on our website our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  We also make available on that website, and in print, if any stockholder or other person so requests, our code of
business conduct and ethics entitled “Code of Ethics” applicable to all employees and Directors, our “Corporate Governance Guidelines,” and the charters for the Audit, Human Resources and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees of our Board of Directors.  Any changes to our Code of Ethics or waiver of our Code of Ethics for senior financial officers, executive officers or Directors will be posted on that website.

History

AT&T, formerly known as SBC Communications Inc. (SBC), was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold AT&T Corp.’s (ATTC) local telephone companies.  On January 1, 1984, we were spun-off from ATTC pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent publicly traded telecommunications services provider.  At formation, we primarily operated in five southwestern states.  Our subsidiaries merged with Pacific Telesis Group in 1997, Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation in 1998 and Ameritech Corporation in 1999, thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) into a total of 13 states.  In November 2005, one of our subsidiaries merged with ATTC, creating one of the world’s largest telecommunications providers.  In connection with the merger, we changed the name of our company from “SBC Communications
Inc.” to “AT&T Inc.”  On December 29, 2006, one of our subsidiaries merged with BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth) expanding our service offerings to an additional nine states.  With the BellSouth acquisition, we thereby acquired BellSouth’s 40 percent economic interest in AT&T Mobility LLC (AT&T Mobility), formerly Cingular Wireless LLC, resulting in 100 percent ownership of AT&T Mobility.  Our services and products are marketed under the AT&T brand name, including alliances such as AT&T Yahoo! and AT&T | DISH Network.  In 2007, we began rebranding our wireless operations from Cingular to AT&T.

Scope

We rank among the largest providers of telecommunications services in the United States and the world.  We offer our services and products to consumers in the U.S. and services and products to businesses and other providers of telecommunications services worldwide.

The services and products that we offer vary by market, and include: local exchange services, wireless communications, long-distance services, data/broadband and Internet services, telecommunications equipment, managed networking, wholesale services and directory advertising and publishing.  We group our operating subsidiaries as follows, corresponding to our operating segments for financial reporting purposes:

•

AT&T wireline subsidiaries provide primarily landline telecommunications services to residential, business, and governmental customers, both domestically and internationally,

•

AT&T Mobility provides both wireless voice and data communications services across the U.S. and, through roaming agreements, in a substantial number of foreign countries and is held by a wireless subsidiary of AT&T,

•

directory subsidiaries provide services related to directory advertising and publishing,

•

other subsidiaries provide results from Sterling Commerce Inc. (Sterling), all corporate and other operations and results of BellSouth for the two days following the December 29, 2006 acquisition.

We provide telecommunications services throughout the U.S. and
internationally.  Our traditional wireline subsidiaries operate in thirteen states: Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana,
Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin (13-state area).  The BellSouth wireline subsidiaries operate in
nine states:  Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee (BellSouth region).
  Wireline local exchange services offered in our 13-state area and the BellSouth region are provided through regulated subsidiaries which
 operate within authorized regions subject to regulation by each state in which they operate and by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC).  Additional information relating to regulation is contained under the heading “Government Regulation” below


AT&T Inc.

and in the 2006 AT&T Annual Report to Stockholders under the heading “Operating Environment and Trends of the Business,” and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Our acquisitions of BellSouth and ATTC will help change the focus of our company towards business and broadband/data revenues and wireless product integration with AT&T Mobility.  Discussed below are the factors upon which we are focusing in 2007.

Business Markets

With the acquisitions of BellSouth and ATTC, we expect to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of global communications services, both wireless and wireline, to large businesses and wholesale customers worldwide.  We expect significant opportunity in the small- and medium-business markets and to increase our governmental and large-business (referred to as “enterprise”) customer base.  We also expect to extend our wholesale business to other service products and systems integration services.

Data/Broadband

U-verse Services (Project Lightspeed)

In June 2004, we announced key advances in developing a network capable of delivering a new generation of integrated digital television, high-speed broadband and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services to our residential and small-business customers.  We have been building out this network in numerous locations and are now providing AT&T U-verse

SM

services, including U-verse TV (IPTV) video, in limited parts of 11 markets as of year-end 2006 and expect to launch additional markets during 2007.  Our deployment strategy is to enter each market on a limited basis in order to ensure that all operating and back-office systems are functioning successfully and then expand within each market as we continue to monitor these systems to ensure customer satisfaction with our services.  In these market expansions, we expect to continue to
use contracted outside labor in addition to our employees as installers; our rate of expansion will be slowed if we cannot hire and train an adequate number of technicians to keep pace with customer demand.  During our launch into these additional markets, we also expect to add additional features to our IP video service offering.  We expect to have the capability to offer service to approximately 19 million living units by the end of 2008, as part of our initial deployment, and expect to spend approximately $4,600 in network-related deployment costs and capital expenditures from 2006 through 2008, as well as additional customer activation capital expenditures.  We remain on budget for this overall target and expect to spend approximately $3,100 during 2007 and 2008.  These expenditures may increase slightly if the programming and features of the video offering expand or if additional network conditioning is required.

With respect to our IP video service, we continue to work with our vendors to continue to improve, in a timely manner, the requisite hardware and software technology.  Our deployment plans could be delayed if we do not receive required equipment and software on schedule.  We have completed most negotiations, and consistent with our profitability assumptions, with programming owners (e.g., movie studios and cable networks) to offer existing television programs and movies and, if applicable, other new interactive services.  Also, as discussed in the “Regulatory Developments” section, we are supporting legislation at the state level that would streamline the regulatory process for new video competitors to enter the market.

We believe that IPTV is subject to federal oversight as a “video service” under the Federal Communications Act.  However, some cable providers and municipalities have claimed that certain IP services should be treated as a traditional cable service and therefore subject to the applicable state and local regulation, which could include the requirement to pay fees to obtain local franchises for our IP video service.  Certain municipalities have refused us permission to use our existing right-of-ways to deploy or activate our U-verse-related services and products, resulting in litigation.  Pending negotiations and current or threatened litigation involving municipalities could delay our deployment plans in those areas for 2007 and future years.  If the courts were to decide that state and local regulation were applicable to our U-verse services, it could have a material adverse effect on the cost,
timing and extent of our deployment plans.

Additional information about Project Lightspeed is included in our “Operating Environment and Trends of the Business” section under the heading “Expected Growth Areas” on page 31 of the 2006 AT&T Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Voice over Internet Protocol

VoIP is generally used to describe the transmission of voice using Internet-Protocol-based technology rather than a traditional wire and switch-based telephone network.  A company using this technology often can provide voice services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and because this technology has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation.  But, depending on the bandwidth allocated, VoIP services may not necessarily be of the same quality as traditional telephone service.  The FCC has ongoing proceedings that will address various regulatory issues, including universal service, intercarrier compensation, numbering, disability access and consumer protection.


AT&T Inc.

Notwithstanding the unresolved regulatory questions before the FCC and various state public utility commissions, numerous communications providers have begun providing various forms of VoIP or announced their intentions to do so in the near future.  These providers include both established companies as well as new entrants.  Thus, while the deployment of VoIP will result in increased competition for our voice services, it also presents growth opportunities for us to develop new products for our customers.  Additional information relating to VoIP is contained in the 2006 AT&T Annual Report to Stockholders in our “Regulatory Developments” section under the heading “Voice over Internet Protocol,” and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Wireless

AT&T Mobility began operations in October 2000 as a joint venture between us and BellSouth.  Upon our acquisition of BellSouth, AT&T Mobility became a wholly-owned subsidiary.  In 2004, AT&T Mobility acquired AT&T Wireless Services, Inc.

Prior to the BellSouth merger, revenues from AT&T Mobility were recognized as equity in net income of affiliates in our Consolidated Statements of Income and were recorded in our wireless segment for segment reporting.  Following the December 29, 2006 acquisition, we now record wireless revenues and expenses in our operating income and will continue to present wireless results in our wireless segment.  As of December 31, 2006, we served approximately 61 million customers and are the largest provider of mobile wireless voice and data communications services in the U.S in terms of customer base.

Our wireless networks contain digital transmission technologies known as Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) for data communications.  We have substantially completed deploying Universal Mobile Telecommunications System/ High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (UMTS/HSPDA) third generation (3G) network technology in our network covering most major metropolitan areas of the U.S.  UMTS/HSDPA provides superior speeds for data and video services, as well as operating efficiencies, using the same spectrum and infrastructure for voice and data on an IP-based platform.


AT&T Inc.

BUSINESS OPERATIONS

Operating Segments

Our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services and are managed accordingly.  We analyze our various operating segments based on segment income.  Interest expense, interest income and other income (expense) – net, are managed only on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results.  Therefore, these items are not included in the calculation of each segment’s percentage of our total segment income.  As a result of our November 2005 acquisition of ATTC, we have revised our segment reporting to represent how we now manage our business, restating prior periods to conform to the current segments.  Due to the proximity of our acquisition of BellSouth to year-end, we have reported those results from the time of closing through year-end in the other segment even though there may be some overlap in the products and service provided by
that segment and our wireline and/or directory segments.  We have four reportable segments:  (1) wireline;  (2) wireless; (3) directory; and (4) other.

Additional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading “Segment Results” on pages 20 through 29 and in Note 4 of the 2006 AT&T Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Wireline

Wireline is our largest operating segment, providing approximately 58% of 2006 segment operating revenues and 54% of our 2006 total segment income.  Our wireline segment consists of our subsidiaries that operate as both retail and wholesale sellers of communication services domestically and internationally.  At December 31, 2006, our wireline subsidiaries were serving approximately 25 million retail consumer lines, 17 million retail business lines and 4 million wholesale lines (including approximately 1 million lines sold through ATTC), for a total of 46 million access lines.

Services and Products

We divide our wireline services into three product-based categories:  voice, data and other.

Voice

– Voice includes traditional local and long-distance service provided to retail customers and wholesale access to our network and individual network elements provided to competitors.  Voice also includes calling features, fees to maintain wire located inside customer premises, pay telephones, customer premise equipment and other equipment sales and other miscellaneous voice products.  We also have a number of integrated voice and data services, such as integrated network connections, that provide customers the ability to integrate access for their voice and data services, the data component of which is included in the data category.  Additionally, voice revenues do not include any of our VoIP revenues, which are included in data revenues.

Long distance consists of traditional long distance and international long distance for customers that select us as their primary long-distance carrier.  Long distance also includes services provided by calling card, 1-800 services and conference calling.  These services are used in a wide variety of business applications, including sales, reservation centers or customer service centers.  Other long-distance services offered include call routing by origination point, time-of-day routing and virtual private network applications, including dedicated outbound facilities.  We also provide wholesale switched access service to other service providers.

Calling features are enhanced telephone services available to retail customers such as Caller ID, Call Waiting and voice mail.  Customers that subscribe to these services can have the number and/or name of callers displayed on their phone, be signaled that additional calls are incoming, and send and receive voice messages.  These services are not regulated by the FCC and are generally more profitable than basic local phone service.

Data –

Data includes traditional products, such as switched and dedicated transport, Internet access and network integration, and data equipment sales.  Additionally, data products include high-speed connections such as private lines, packet, dedicated Internet and enterprise networking services, as well as products such as DSL/broadband, dial-up Internet access and WiFi (local radio frequency commonly known as wireless fidelity).  We also provide businesses voice applications over IP-based networks (i.e., Enhanced Virtual Private Networks or “EVPN”).  Over the past several years, we have built out our new multi protocol label switching/asynchronous transfer mode, or MPLS/ATM network, to supplement, and eventually replace, our other extensive global data networks.  These products allow us to provide highly complex global data networks.

Private line uses high-capacity digital circuits to transmit from point-to-point in multiple configurations and allows customers to create internal data networks and to access external data networks.


AT&T Inc.

Switched Transport services transmit data using switching equipment to transfer the data between multiple lines before reaching its destination.  Dedicated Transport services use a single direct line to transmit data between destinations.  Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), Dedicated Frame Relay, broadband digital subscriber lines (DSL), Digital Services and Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) are examples of Dedicated Transport services.  ISDN transmits voice, video and data over a single line in support of a wide range of applications, including Internet access.  Frame Relay is a routing technology that breaks a data signal into individual pieces of data to travel at high speeds and then recombines the data prior to arriving at its destination.  DSL is a digital modem technology that converts existing twisted-pair telephone lines into access paths for multimedia and high-speed data communications to
the Internet or private networks.  DSL allows customers to simultaneously make a phone call and access information via the Internet or an office local area network.  Digital Services use dedicated digital circuits to transmit digital data at various high rates of speed.  SONET provides customer access to our backbone network at various high speeds.

Network integration services include installation of business data systems, local area networking and other data networking offerings.  Internet access services include a wide range of products for residences and businesses, varying by market.  Internet services offered include basic dial-up access service, dedicated access, web hosting, e-mail and high-speed access services.

Packet services consist of data networks using packet switching and transmission technologies, including Frame Relay, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and IP connectivity services.  Packet services enable customers to transmit large volumes of data economically and securely and are used for local area network interconnection, remote site, point of sale and branch office communications.  Frame relay, including IP-enabled frame relay and ATM Services are widely deployed as private data networks.  High speed packet services, including IP-enabled frame relay service, are used extensively by enterprise (large business) customers.

Dedicated Internet services are designed to meet the needs of all types of commercial and governmental enterprises, including small and medium sized businesses.  Our managed Internet services provide customers with dedicated high speed access to the Internet managed by us.

Enterprise networking services provide comprehensive support from network design, implementation and installation to ongoing network operations and management for networks of varying scales, including local area networks, wide area networks, and virtual private networks.  These services include applications such as e-mail, order entry systems, employee directories, human resource transactions and other database applications.

We also provide local, interstate and international wholesale networking capacity to other service providers.  We offer a combination of high volume transmission capacity and conventional dedicated line services on a regional, national and international basis to wireless carriers, interchange carriers, Internet service providers (ISPs) and facility-based and switchless resellers.  Our wholesale customers are primarily large ISPs, wireless carriers, competitive local exchange carriers, regional phone companies, interexchange carriers, cable companies and systems integrators.  We also have sold dedicated network capacity through indefeasible rights-of-use agreements under which capacity is furnished for contract terms as long as 25 years.

Other –

Other includes managed web hosting, application management, security service, integration services, customer premises equipment, outsourcing, directory and operator assistance services, government-related services and AT&T | DISH Network video services.

Our managed web-hosting services for businesses provide network, server and security infrastructure as well as built-in data storage and include application performance management, database management, hardware and operating system management.  Our hosting services also provide customers with secure access to detailed reporting information about their infrastructure and applications.  Security services include business continuity and disaster recovery services as well as premise and network based security products.

Customer premises equipment and other equipment sales range from single-line and cordless telephones to sophisticated digital PBX systems.  PBX is a private telephone switching system, typically used by businesses and usually located on a customer’s premises, which provides intra-premise telephone services as well as access to our network.


AT&T Inc.

Wireless

Our wireless segment reflects 100 percent of the results reported by AT&T Mobility.  Prior to our December 29, 2006 acquisition of BellSouth, our consolidated financial statements reported our 60 percent proportionate share of AT&T Mobility’s results as equity in net income of affiliates.  For segment reporting, we reported this equity in net income of affiliates in our other segment.  Following the BellSouth acquisition, as AT&T Mobility is now a wholly-owned subsidiary, we include 100 percent of our wireless results in our operating revenues and expenses under the appropriate line items of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

When analyzing our segment results, we evaluate wireless results on a stand-alone basis using information provided by AT&T Mobility during the year.  Prior to the BellSouth acquisition, our consolidated operating revenues did not include AT&T Mobility’s results.  However, we did include 100 percent of wireless revenues and expenses excluding this adjustment when we analyzed our operating segment results.  On that segment basis, the wireless segment provided approximately 37% of total segment operating revenues and 21% of our 2006 total segment income.

Services and Products

We offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice communications services in a variety of pricing plans, including postpaid and prepaid service plans.  Our voice offerings are tailored to meet the communications needs of targeted customer segments, including youth, family, active professionals, small businesses government and major national corporate accounts.

Service –

Our voice service is generally offered on a contract basis for one or two year periods, referred to as postpaid.  Under the terms of these contracts, service is billed and provided on a monthly basis according to the applicable rate plan chosen.  Our wireless services include basic local wireless communications service, long-distance service and roaming services. Roaming services enable our subscribers to utilize other carriers’ networks when they are “roaming” outside our network footprint.  We also charge fees to other carriers for providing roaming services to their customers when their customers utilize our network.  We had approximately 50 million postpaid subscribers (excluding reseller subscribers) at December 31, 2006.  Additionally, we offer prepaid service to meet the demands of distinct consumer segments, such as the youth market, families and
small business customers, who prefer to control usage or pay in advance.

Wireless data continues to be a growing area of our business, with its revenue representing an increasing share of our overall subscriber revenue.  We are experiencing solid growth from both consumer and enterprise wireless data services. We continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and applications developers in order to further capitalize on the continued growth in the demand for wireless data services.  We believe we are the largest provider of wireless data in the U.S. wireless industry based on subscribers.

Equipment –

We sell a wide variety of handsets and personal computer wireless data cards manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services.  We also sell accessories, such as carrying cases, hands-free devices, batteries, battery chargers and other items, to consumers, as well as to agents and other third-party distributors for resale.  Like other wireless service providers, we provide postpaid contract subscribers substantial equipment subsidies to initiate or upgrade service.

Prior to our BellSouth acquisition, AT&T Mobility was an SEC registrant by virtue of its publicly traded debt securities and filed separate Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other reports with the SEC.  Additional information on our wireless segment is contained in the 2006 AT&T Annual Report to Stockholders in the “Operating Environment and Trends of Business” section under the heading “Expected Growth Areas,” “Wireless” beginning on page 31 and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Directory

Our directory segment includes our directory operations, which publish Yellow and White Pages directories and sell directory and Internet-based advertising.  The directory segment provided approximately 4% of total segment operating revenues and 12% of our 2006 total segment income.  Our directory subsidiaries operate primarily in our 13-state area.  In November 2004, a subsidiary in our directory segment entered into a joint venture agreement with BellSouth and purchased the online directory publisher YELLOWPAGES.COM (YPC).  Prior to our December 2006 acquisition of BellSouth, in our consolidated financial statements, we reported our proportionate share of YPC’s results as equity in net income of affiliates.  For segment reporting, we reported this equity in net income of affiliates in our directory segment.  As of December 29, 2006, YPC is a wholly-owned subsidiary and we now include those results in
our operating revenues and expenses under the appropriate line items of our Consolidated Statements of Income.


AT&T Inc.

Other

Our other segment includes operations from Sterling, our business integration software and services subsidiary, corporate and other operations. The other segment provided approximately 1% of total segment operating revenues and 13% of our 2006 total segment income.

Sterling provides “multi-enterprise collaboration” services to businesses in various industries, including retail, financial services, manufacturing, healthcare and telecom.  In recent years, Sterling has completed a number of acquisitions in order to provide end-to-end order fulfillment for customers.

Due to proximity of the BellSouth acquisition to year-end, we have included those operations for the two days of 2006 following the acquisition.  BellSouth provides voice, data/broadband and video services, similar to those provided in our 13-state area by our wireline segment, in the southeastern U.S. BellSouth also provides print and online directory services.

Prior to our December 2006 acquisition of BellSouth, our wireless segment revenues were reported in equity in net income of affiliates in our consolidated financial statements due to our equity accounting for the joint venture.  We accounted for our 60 percent economic interest in AT&T Mobility under the equity method of accounting since we shared control equally with our 40 percent economic partner in the joint venture.  We held equal voting rights and representation on the board of directors that controlled AT&T Mobility.  Accordingly, our consolidated results included wireless results in the “Equity in Net Income of Affiliates” line.  We did not report wireless revenues in our consolidated financial statements.  However, when analyzing our segment results, we evaluated wireless results on a stand-alone basis.  The table below shows the effect on our other classes of services (shown in the

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Our wireline and BellSouth subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state commissions which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local, long-distance and network access services.  These subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to interstate and international rates and services, including interstate access charges.  Access charges are designed to compensate our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers.

Wireless communications providers must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC.  Additionally, while wireless communications providers’ prices and service offerings are generally not subject to state regulation, an increasing number of states are attempting to regulate or legislate various aspects of wireless services.

Our subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. are subject to the jurisdiction of national regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided.  Regulation is generally limited to operational licensing authority for the provision of enterprise services.

Additional information relating to federal and state regulation of our subsidiaries is contained in the 2006 AT&T Annual Report to Stockholders under the heading “Operating Environment and Trends of the Business” beginning on page 30, and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Certain of our subsidiaries own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property necessary to conduct business.  We actively pursue patents, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property within the U.S. and abroad.  We maintain a global portfolio of more than 5,000 trademark and service mark registrations.  We have also entered into agreements that permit other companies, in exchange for fees and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to utilize certain of our trademarks and service marks.  We periodically receive offers from third parties to obtain licenses for patent and other intellectual rights in exchange for royalties or other payments as well as notices asserting that our products or services infringe on their patents and other intellectual property rights.  While the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, we do not believe
that the resolution of any of these infringement claims or the expiration or non-renewal of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations.

MAJOR CUSTOMER

No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in 2006, 2005 or 2004.

COMPETITION

Information relating to competition in each of our operating segments is contained in the 2006 AT&T Annual Report to Stockholders under the heading “Competition” beginning on page 33, and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

AT&T Labs’ scientists and engineers conduct research in a variety of areas, including IP; advanced network design and architecture; network operations support systems; data mining technologies and advanced speech technologies.  AT&T Labs works with our business units to create new services and invent tools and systems to manage secure and reliable networks for us and our customers.  In addition to AT&T Labs, applied research, technology planning and evaluation services are also conducted at our wireline subsidiary, SBC Laboratories, Inc.  We also have a research agreement with Telcordia Technologies, formerly Bell Communications Research, Inc.  Research and development expenses were $223 in 2006, $130 million in 2005 and $86 million in 2004.

As of January 31, 2007, we employed approximately 302,000 persons.  Approximately 60 percent of our employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) or other unions.

•

Our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to offset increasing competition in our wireline and wireless markets.

•

•

The impact of our acquisition of BellSouth, including the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; the risk that the cost savings and any other synergies from the acquisition may take longer to realize than expected or may not be fully realized; and the disruption from the acquisition may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers.

Readers are cautioned that other factors discussed in this report, although not enumerated here, also could materially affect our future earnings.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

Our properties do not lend themselves to description by character and location of principal units.  At December 31, 2006, approximately 75% of our property, plant and equipment was owned by our wireline subsidiaries and 15% was owned by our wireless subsidiaries.  Network access lines represented approximately 32% of our telephone plant; central office equipment represented 32%; land and buildings represented 13%; other equipment, comprised principally of furniture and office equipment and vehicles and other work equipment, represented 17%; and other miscellaneous property represented 7%.

Substantially all of the installations of central office equipment are located in buildings and on land we own.  Many garages, administrative and business offices and telephone centers are in leased quarters.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to numerous lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and
other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  Additional information regarding litigation is included in the 2006 AT&T
Annual Report to Stockholders under the headings “Antitrust Litigation,” “Retiree Phone Concession Litigation,

With respect to NSA Litigation, in late February 2007, the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California ordered a limited stay on activity in the consolidated case while the Hepting appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is pending.

 pending legal proceedings to which we or our subsidiaries are subject are required to be disclosed as material legal proceedings pursuant
to this item.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED

STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  The number of stockholders of record as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 1,766,266 and 1,516,977.  The number of stockholders of record as of February 20, 2007 was 1,792,173.  We declared dividends, on a quarterly basis, totaling $1.35 per share in 2006 and $1.30 per share in 2005.

During 2006, non-employee directors acquired shares of common stock pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferral Plan.  Under the plan, a director may make an annual election to receive all or part of his or her annual retainer or fees in the form of shares or deferred stock units (DSUs) that are convertible into shares.  Each director also receives an annual grant of DSUs.  During 2006, an aggregate of 109,188 shares and DSUs were acquired by non-employee directors at prices ranging from $25.95 to $35.75, in each case the fair market value of the shares on the date of acquisition.  The issuances of shares and DSUs were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.  During the fourth quarter of 2005, two non-employee directors acquired a total of 8,140 restricted stock units in connection with our acquisition of ATTC, under ATTC’s AT&T 2004 Long Term Incentive
Program.  Under the program, units are convertible into shares of common stock.  The issuance of restricted stock units was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

On November 18, 2005, in connection with the completion of our acquisition of ATTC, we issued 768,391.4 shares of AT&T Perpetual Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share (the “Subsidiary Preferred Shares”), with an aggregate liquidation preference of $768,391,400, to certain wholly owned subsidiaries of AT&T.  The Subsidiary Preferred Shares were issued in connection with the merger in exchange for shares of preferred stock of ATTC that were formerly owned exclusively by wholly owned subsidiaries of ATTC.  We received no cash proceeds as a result of the issuance of the Subsidiary Preferred Shares.  The exchange of Subsidiary Preferred Shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The registrant maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrant is recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to its management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.  The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006.  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2006.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a)  Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of AT&T is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  AT&T’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the integrity and reliability of the published financial statements.  AT&T management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006.  In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

.  We have excluded from the scope of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting the operations and related assets of BellSouth and AT&T Mobility, which we acquired on December 29, 2006.  At December 31, 2006 and for the period from December 29
through December 31, 2006, total assets and total revenues subject to BellSouth’s internal control over financial reporting represented 27% and 0.2% of AT&T’s consolidated total assets and total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 and total assets and total revenues subject to AT&T Mobility’s internal control over financial reporting represented 36% and 0.3% of AT&T’s consolidated total assets and total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006.  Based on its assessment, AT&T management believes that, as of December 31, 2006, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

(b)  Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

AT&T’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting.  The attestation report is included in the 2006 AT&T Annual Report to Stockholders on page 82, which is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

Plans that have not been approved by stockholders include the 1995 Management Stock Option Plan (“1995 Plan”) and the Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferral Plan (“Non-Employee Director Plan”).  The 1995 Plan provides for grants of stock options to management employees (10-year terms) subject to vesting requirements and shortened exercise terms upon termination of employment. No further options may be issued under this plan. Under the Non-Employee Director Plan, participants may elect to receive stock units in lieu of retainers and fees. In addition, each non-employee Director receives an annual award of stock units equal in value to one and one-half times the annual retainer.  Directors who became board members after November 21, 1997, but before September 24, 2004, also receive up to 10 annual grants of stock units equal to $13,000 each.

Also included in column (c) are up to 4,292,876 shares that may be purchased under the Stock Savings Plan with reinvested dividend equivalents on deferred share units purchased by mid-level and above managers and limited company partial matching contributions.

In addition, participants receive 2 options for each share purchased with employee payroll deductions. The options have a 10-year term and a strike price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. The Stock Savings Plan was last approved by stockholders in 1994. The plan was amended by the Board of Directors in 2000 to increase the number of shares available for purchase under the plan (including shares from the company
match and reinvested dividend equivalents) and shares subject to options. Stockholder approval was not required for the amendment. To the
