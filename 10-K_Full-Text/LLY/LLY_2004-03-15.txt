Item 1.

Business

Eli Lilly and Company (the “Company” or “Registrant”, which may be referred to
as “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in 1901 in Indiana to succeed to the
drug manufacturing business founded in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1876 by
Colonel Eli Lilly. We discover, develop, manufacture, and sell products in one
significant business segment—pharmaceutical products. Operations of our animal
health business segment are not material to our financial statements. We
manufacture and distribute our products through owned or leased facilities in
the United States, Puerto Rico, and 17 other countries. Our products are sold
in approximately 140 countries.

Most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own
scientists, and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to
continue to discover and develop innovative new pharmaceutical products. We
direct our research efforts primarily toward the search for products to prevent
and treat human diseases. We also conduct research to find products to treat
diseases in animals and to increase the efficiency of animal food production.

Products

Our products include:

Neuroscience products

,

our largest-selling product group, including
Zyprexa®, a product for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania and

angioplasty, atherectomy or stent placement; Xigris®, a novel biotech
agent to treat adults with severe sepsis at high risk of death;
Dobutrex®, an agent for cardiac decompensation; and Cynt™, marketed
outside the United States for treatment of hypertension;

Anti-infectives

, including the oral antibiotics Ceclor®, Keflex®,
Keftab®, and Lorabid®, used to treat a wide range of bacterial
infections; and Vancocin® HCl, an antibiotic used primarily to treat
staphylococcal infections; and

Other pharmaceutical products

, including the anti-ulcer agent Axid® and
the erectile dysfunction treatment Cialis®, approved in over 55 countries
in 2003. Cialis is sold in North America and the European Union by a
joint venture between Lilly and ICOS Corporation, and is sold by us in
other territories. Cialis was launched in the United States by the Lilly
ICOS joint venture in December 2003.

Marketing

We sell most of our products worldwide. We adapt our marketing methods and
product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs.

Pharmaceuticals – United States

In the United States, we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through
independent wholesale distributors. Our marketing policy is designed to assure
that products and relevant medical information are immediately available to
physicians, pharmacies, hospitals, and appropriate health care professionals
throughout the country. Three wholesale distributors in the United States –
AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and McKesson Corporation
– each accounted for between 15 and 16 percent of our worldwide consolidated
net sales in 2003. No other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of
consolidated net sales. We also sell pharmaceutical products directly to the
United States government and other manufacturers, but those sales are not
material.

We promote our major pharmaceutical products in the United States through sales
representatives who call upon physicians, wholesalers, hospitals, managed-care
organizations, retail pharmacists, and other health care professionals. We
advertise in medical and drug journals, distribute literature and samples of
certain products to physicians, and exhibit at medical meetings. In addition,
we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the United States and we
maintain web sites with information about all our major products. Divisions of
our sales force are dedicated to product lines or practice areas, such as
primary care, neuroscience, diabetes care, acute care, endocrinology, and
oncology. We have entered into licensing arrangements under which other
companies market certain products manufactured by us, such as Darvon, Sarafem,
Axid, Keftab, Lorabid, and Permax.

Large purchasers of pharmaceuticals, such as managed-care groups and government
and long-term care institutions, account for a significant portion of total
pharmaceutical purchases in the United States. We have created special sales
groups to service managed-care organizations, government and long-term care
institutions, hospital contract administrators, and certain retail pharmacies.
In response to competitive

-2-


pressures, we have entered into arrangements with a number of these
organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more Company
products or other cost-sharing arrangements.

Pharmaceuticals – Outside the United States

Outside the United States, we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily
through sales representatives. While the products marketed vary from country
to country, neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total
sales. Distribution patterns vary from country to country. In most countries,
we maintain our own sales and distribution organizations. In some countries,
however, we market our products through independent distributors.

Animal Health Products

Our Elanco Animal Health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the
United States to market animal health products. Elanco also has an extensive
sales force outside the United States. Elanco sells its products primarily to
wholesale distributors.

Raw Materials and Product Supply

Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are
available from more than one source. We obtain certain raw materials
principally from only one source. In addition, three of our significant
products are manufactured by others: Actos by Takeda; ReoPro by Centocor; and
Xigris by Lonza Biologics (bulk product) and DSM, N.V. (finished product). If
we were unable to obtain certain materials from present sources, we could
experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or, in
some cases, implemented alternative processes.

Our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at three sites in Indiana as well as
locations in Ireland, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. Finishing
operations, including labeling and packaging, take place at a number of sites
throughout the world.

We seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and maintain
inventory in a way that will allow us to meet all expected product demand while
maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve
efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. However,
pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary
widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can
be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures.
Accordingly, if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns or extraordinary
unplanned increases in demand, we could experience an interruption in supply of
certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or
expanded.

Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights

Overview

Intellectual property protection is, in the aggregate, material to our ability
to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations. We own, have
applied for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents, both in the
United States and in other countries, relating to products, product uses,
formulations, and manufacturing processes. There is no assurance that the
patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been granted
would be found valid if challenged. Moreover, patents relating to particular
products, uses, formulations, or processes do not preclude other manufacturers
from employing

-3-


alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or formulations
that might successfully compete with our patented products.

Outside the United States, the standard of intellectual property protection for
pharmaceuticals varies widely. While many countries have reasonably strong
patent laws, other countries currently provide little or no effective
protection for inventions or other intellectual property rights. Under the
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPs) administered
by the World Trade Organization (WTO), over 140 countries have now agreed to
provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to
assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners.
However, in many countries, this agreement will not become fully effective for
many years. It is possible that changes to this agreement will be made in the
future that will diminish or further delay its implementation in developing
countries. It is too soon to assess how much, if at all, we will benefit
commercially from these changes.

When a product patent expires, the patent holder often loses effective market
exclusivity for the product. This can result in a severe and rapid decline in
sales of the formerly patented product, particularly in the United States.
However, in some cases the innovator company can obtain additional commercial
benefits through manufacturing trade secrets; later-expiring patents on
processes, uses, or formulations; trademark use; or marketing exclusivity that
may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.

Our Intellectual Property Portfolio

We consider patent protection for certain products, processes, and uses –
particularly that relating to Zyprexa, Gemzar, Humalog, Evista, Actos, ReoPro,
Xigris, Strattera and Cialis – to be important to our operations. For many of
our products, in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on
manufacturing processes, formulations, or uses that may extend exclusivity
beyond the expiration of the product patent.

United States compound patent expirations include those claiming the respective
active ingredients in Zyprexa, 2011; Humalog, 2013; and ReoPro, 2015. The
Gemzar compound patent in the U.S. expires in 2010, but a use patent covering
treatment of neoplasms with Gemzar is in force until 2012. We hold a number of
U.S. patents covering Evista and its approved uses in osteoporosis prevention
and treatment that we believe should provide us exclusivity in the United
States until at least 2012. In the United States, the Actos compound patent
extends beyond the duration of our co-promotion agreement, which is in force
until 2006. Xigris is a complex glycoprotein biologic product that is produced
through recombinant DNA technology. Xigris is not subject to the Abbreviated
New Drug Application process under the Hatch-Waxman law as described below. In
addition, we hold patents on the DNA materials, certain uses, manufacturing
process, and the glycoprotein itself. We believe the intellectual property
protection for Xigris should provide us marketing exclusivity until 2015. For
Strattera, we hold a use patent in the U.S. for treating attention
deficit-hyperactivity disorder, the sole approved use of the drug. This use
patent expires in 2015 and we have applied for a patent term extension to 2016.
For Cialis, compound and method of use patent protection exists into 2016 and
we have applied for a patent term extension into 2017.

Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider
in the aggregate to be important to our operations. Trademark protection
varies throughout the world, with protection continuing in some countries as
long as the mark is used, and in other countries as long as it is registered.
Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms.

Patent Challenges Under the Hatch-Waxman Act

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly
known as “Hatch-Waxman,” made a complex set of changes to both patent and
new-drug-approval laws in the United

-4-


States. Before Hatch-Waxman, no drug could be approved without providing the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) complete safety and efficacy studies,

i.e.

,
a complete New Drug Application (NDA). Hatch-Waxman authorizes the FDA to
approve generic versions of innovative medicines without such information by
filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). In an ANDA, the generic
manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version
and the NDA-approved drug – not safety and efficacy.

Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until
after the innovator’s patents expire. However, after the innovator has
marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA
alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s NDA are
invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a “Paragraph IV
certification.” The innovator must then file suit against the generic
manufacturer to protect its patents. If one or more of the NDA-listed patents
are successfully challenged, the first filer of a Paragraph IV certification
may be entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity over all other
generic manufacturers.

In recent years, generic manufacturers have used Paragraph IV certifications
extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals,
and we expect this trend to continue. We are currently in litigation with
numerous generic manufacturers arising from their Paragraph IV certifications
on Zyprexa, Evista, and Sarafem. For more information on the Zyprexa and
Evista patent litigation, see Part 1, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.

The FDA has recently finalized regulations clarifying the process by which
patents can be listed with the FDA by innovators. In addition, Congress made
significant changes to the Hatch-Waxman law as part of the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 by allowing only
a single 30-month period during which the approval of any individual generic
drug application can be delayed while patent issues are resolved. Finally, the
so-called “generic exclusivity” provisions that provide incentives for generic
companies to challenge drug patents were substantially tightened by Congress.
New statutory provisions now mandate sharing the generic exclusivity in certain
situations and may require forfeiting the exclusivity altogether, and/or
further limit the so-called “exclusivity parking” after a patent challenge has
been completed. Collectively, these regulatory and statutory changes are not
expected to significantly affect the operation of the Hatch-Waxman law as it
relates to our ability to realize patent-based exclusivity for new drugs.

Competition

Our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other
companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Our animal
health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of pharmaceutical,
chemical, and other companies that operate animal health divisions or
subsidiaries.

Important competitive factors include product efficacy, safety, and ease of
use, price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness,
service, and research and development of new products and processes. If
competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with
therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive
price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new products that
we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products
that are later developed by competitors. Manufacturers of generic
pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than
research-based pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products
significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a branded product
loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from
generic forms of the product. In many countries outside the United States,
patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic or
“knockoff” versions of our products. To successfully compete for business with
managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often
demonstrate that

-5-


our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as
compared with other forms of care.

We believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in
discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet
medical needs, together with our ability to manufacture the products
efficiently and to market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.
There can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will
result in commercially successful products or that our products or processes
will not become outmoded from time to time as a result of products or processes
developed by our competitors.

Government Regulation

Our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national, state and local
agencies. The lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing, data
analysis, manufacturing development, and regulatory review necessary for
required governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay
product introductions in a given market. Promotion, marketing, manufacturing,
and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated in all
major world markets. In addition, our operations are subject to complex
federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws
and regulations. The laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale
of current products and the introduction of new products will continue to
require substantial scientific and technical effort, time, and expense and
significant capital investment.

Of particular importance is the FDA in the United States. Pursuant to the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over virtually
all of our businesses and administers requirements covering the testing,
safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, quality control, distribution, labeling,
marketing, advertising, dissemination of information and post-marketing
surveillance of our pharmaceutical products. The FDA, along with the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), also regulates our animal health products.

Since 1995, the approval of new drugs across the European Union (EU) has been
possible using the European Medicines Evaluation Agency’s (EMEA) centralized
approval process or using the national mutual recognition process. The use of
either of these procedures provides a more consistent and, in some cases, a
more rapid approval within the EU member states than was the case when each
member state operated its own approval process.

In addition, the marketing, promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical
manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with
purchasers and prescribers, are subject to various other federal and state
laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute and the False Claims Act and
state laws governing kickbacks and false claims. These laws are administered
by, among others, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of
the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade Commission, the
Office of Personnel Management and state attorneys general. Over the past
several years, many of those agencies have increased their enforcement
activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. Over this period, several
cases brought by these agencies against other companies under these and other
laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil
settlements. In recent months, several pharmaceutical companies have received
subpoenas from one or more of these agencies regarding promotional practices
with respect to a variety of products, including neuroscience products. It is
possible that we could become subject to administrative and legal proceedings
and actions by those governmental agencies. Such actions could include claims
for civil penalties (including treble damages under the False Claims Act),
criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from
federal health care programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in such
an action could have a material adverse impact on the Company. See Part I,
Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” for currently pending matters involving the
Company.

-6-


In the United States, we are required to provide rebates to state governments
on their purchases of certain of our products under state Medicaid programs. In
addition, a model waiver program has been created administratively that allows
states to expand the Medicaid drug benefit to include low-income Medicare
beneficiaries. Other cost containment measures have been adopted or proposed
by federal, state, and local government entities that provide or pay for health
care. In most international markets, we operate in an environment of
government-mandated cost containment programs, which may include price
controls, discounts and rebates, restrictions on physician prescription levels,
restrictions on reimbursement, compulsory licenses and generic substitution.

In the U.S., we expect branded pharmaceutical products to be subject to
increasing pricing pressures. In December 2003, President Bush signed into law
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
(MMA), providing a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program
beginning in 2006. This is expected to put downward pressure on prescription
drug prices. This pressure may be offset by volume increases, but the business
impact of this legislation will not be known until implementation in 2006.
While the MMA retains the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs, several bills have
been introduced that would remove that authority and allow for the immediate
importation of products into the U.S. regardless of their safety or cost. Such
legislation would likely have a negative effect on our U.S. sales.

As a result of the passage of the MMA, all the aged and many of the disabled
Medicaid recipients will receive their benefits through the Medicare program in
the future. This should relieve some state budget pressures but is unlikely to
result in less pricing pressure. A number of states have begun to implement
supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their Medicaid programs.
Several states are also attempting to extend discounted Medicaid prices to
non-Medicaid patients. Additionally, over 25 states are considering proposals
that would result in the importation of prescription drugs for state employees,
state beneficiaries, and in some cases, state citizens. As a result, we expect
pressures on pharmaceutical pricing to continue.

International operations are also generally subject to extensive price and
market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional
cost-containment measures, including proposals that would directly or
indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our
intellectual property protection.

We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or
other potential future legislative or regulatory developments. However, we
expect that pressures on pharmaceutical pricing will continue and likely
intensify in the near term.

Research and Development

Our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years. Our
research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and
development of most of the products we offer today. We invest heavily in
research and development because we believe it is critical to our long-term
competitiveness. At the end of 2003, we employed approximately 8,800 people in
pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities, including
a substantial number of physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate
degrees, and highly skilled technical personnel. Our research and development
expenses were $2.24 billion in 2001, $2.15 billion in 2002, and $2.35 billion
in 2003.

We concentrate our pharmaceutical research and development efforts in five
therapeutic categories: central nervous system and related diseases; endocrine
diseases, including diabetes and osteoporosis; cancer; cardiovascular diseases;
and inflammation. However, we remain opportunistic, selectively pursuing
promising leads in other therapeutic areas. We are actively engaged in
biotechnology research programs involving recombinant DNA, proteins, and
genomics (the development of therapeutics through

-7-


identification of disease-causing genes and their cellular function). In
addition to discovering and developing new chemical entities, we look for ways
to expand the value of existing products through new uses and formulations that
can provide additional benefits to patients. We also conduct research in the
animal sciences, including animal nutrition and physiology and veterinary
medicine.

To supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others, including
educational institutions and research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies, and we contract with others for the performance of research in their
facilities. We use the services of physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and
other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish
the safety and effectiveness of new products. We actively seek out investments
in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and
strengthen our own research efforts. These investments can take many forms,
including licensing arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements,
co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, and acquisitions.

Drug development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. On average, only one
out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to
be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine. The
process from discovery to regulatory approval typically takes
10 to 15 years or longer. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process,
and even late-stage product candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory
approval. We believe our investments in research, both internally and in
collaboration with others, have been rewarded by the number of new
pharmaceutical compounds and indications we have in all stages of development.
Among our new investigational compounds in the later stages of development are
potential therapies for depression, stress urinary incontinence, diabetes and
its complications, osteoporosis, and acute coronary syndrome. Further, we are
studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development. We
are also developing new uses and formulations for many of our important
currently marketed products, such as Zyprexa, Gemzar, Evista, ReoPro, and
Alimta.

Quality Assurance

Our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of
our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and
effectiveness. Product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in
all parts of our operations, including research and development, purchasing,
facilities planning, manufacturing, and distribution. We have implemented
quality-assurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of
scientific information and production processes.

Control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients,
equipment, facilities, manufacturing methods, packaging materials, and
labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes and on
the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements
and our standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical chemical
analyses, microbiological testing, testing in animals, or a combination.
Additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate quality-assurance
group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing
procedures and systems in the parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates, and
third-party suppliers.

As a result of preapproval plant inspections for Zyprexa IntraMuscular and
Forteo in early 2001, the FDA informed us of a number of observations and
issued a warning letter regarding adherence to current Good Manufacturing
Practices (cGMP) regulations. In response, we have been implementing
comprehensive, companywide improvements in our manufacturing operations. In
the fall of 2002, we provided the FDA with a comprehensive plan to upgrade our
manufacturing and quality operations, particularly at our injectable and dry
products facilities in Indianapolis.

In late October 2003, the FDA advised us that the agency now considers our
injectable and dry products facilities in Indianapolis to have reached a level
of cGMP compliance that will allow preapproval site

-8-


inspections for products under review. No further regulatory action is
expected at this time. Although the FDA assessment is an important milestone,
we still have considerable work to do to reach our ultimate goal of building
and sustaining world-class manufacturing, product and process development, and
quality capabilities.

Executive Officers of the Company

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive
officers. All executive officers except Mr. Robert A. Armitage have been
employed by the Company in executive positions during the last five years.
Prior to joining Lilly in 1999, Mr. Armitage was a partner in the law firm of
Vinson & Elkins LLP and headed the firm’s intellectual property law practice in
Washington, D.C. Previously, he held various positions at The Upjohn Company,
where he was vice president, corporate intellectual property law, from 1987 to
1993.

The term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual
meeting of the Board of Directors, to be held on April 19, 2004, or on the date
his or her successor is chosen and qualified. No director or executive officer
of the Company has a “family relationship” with any other director or executive
officer of the Company, as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure
requirement. There is no understanding between any executive officer and any
other person pursuant to which the executive officer was selected.

Financial Information Relating to Business Segments and Classes of Products

You can find financial information relating to our business segments and
classes of products in our 2003 Annual Report at page 24 under “Segment
Information” (page 17 of Exhibit 13 to this Form
10-K). That information is incorporated into this report by reference.

The relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated net
sales changes from year to year. This is due to several factors, including the
introduction of new products by us and by other manufacturers and the
introduction of generic pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations. In addition,
margins vary for our different products due to various factors, including
differences in the cost to manufacture and market the products, the value of
the products to the marketplace, and government restrictions on pricing and
reimbursement.

Financial Information Relating to Foreign and Domestic Operations

You can find financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations
in our 2003 Annual Report at page 24 under “Segment Information” (page 17 of
Exhibit 13). That information is incorporated in this Report by reference.

To date, our overall operations abroad have not been significantly deterred by
local restrictions on the transfer of funds from branches and subsidiaries
located abroad, including the availability of dollar exchange. We cannot
predict what effect these restrictions or the other risks inherent in foreign
operations, including possible nationalization, might have on our future
operations or what other restrictions may be imposed in the future. In
addition, changing currency values can either favorably or unfavorably affect
our financial position and results of operations. We actively manage foreign
exchange risk through various hedging techniques including the use of foreign
currency contracts.

Available Information on Our Web Site

We make available through our company web site, free of charge, our company
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as soon as reasonably
practicable after we electronically file them with, or furnish them to, the
SEC. The reports we make available include annual reports on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements,
registration statements, and any amendments to those documents.

Item 2.

Properties

Our principal domestic and international executive offices are located in
Indianapolis. At December 31, 2003, we owned 13 production and distribution
facilities in the United States and Puerto Rico. Together with the corporate
administrative offices, these facilities contain an aggregate of approximately
9.5 million square feet of floor area dedicated to production, distribution,
and administration. Major production sites include Indianapolis; Clinton and
Lafayette, Indiana; and Carolina and Mayaguez,

-10-


Puerto Rico. We also lease sales and administrative offices in Indianapolis
and a number of other cities located in the United States and abroad.

We own production and distribution facilities in 13 countries outside the
United States and Puerto Rico, containing an aggregate of approximately 4.4
million square feet of floor space. Major production sites include facilities
in the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Spain, Brazil, Italy, and Mexico. We
lease production and warehouse facilities in Puerto Rico and several countries
outside the United States.

Our research and development facilities in the United States consist of
approximately 4.2 million square feet and are located primarily in Indianapolis
and Greenfield, Indiana. Our major research and development facilities abroad
are located in Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Spain and contain
an aggregate of approximately 650,000 square feet.

We believe that none of our properties is subject to any encumbrance, easement,
or other restriction that would detract materially from its value or impair its
use in the operation of the business. The buildings we own are of varying ages
and in good condition.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Zyprexa Patent Litigation

Three generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (Zenith), Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (Reddy) and Teva Pharmaceuticals
(Teva) have submitted abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) seeking
permission to market generic versions of Zyprexa in various dosage forms
several years prior to the expiration of our U.S. patents for the product,
alleging that our patents are invalid or not infringed. In April 2001, we
filed suit against Zenith in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of Indiana seeking a ruling that the challenges to our compound patent
(expiring in 2011) are without merit. We filed similar suits in the same court
against Reddy in June 2001 and Teva in September 2002. The cases have been
consolidated. A trial before a district court judge in Indianapolis was held
in January and February of 2004 and the parties are now in the process of
submitting post-trial briefs. A ruling from the trial court is expected in the
second or third quarter of 2004. Regardless of the trial court’s ruling, we
anticipate that appeals will follow. If we are unsuccessful at the trial court
level, we cannot predict whether any of the generic companies would launch
generic versions of Zyprexa prior to a final resolution of any appeals.

We believe that the generic manufacturers’ claims are without merit and we
expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is not possible to predict
or determine the outcome of this litigation and, accordingly, we can provide no
assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome would have a material
adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and
financial position.

Other Patent Litigation

In October 2002, we were notified that Barr Laboratories, Inc. had submitted an
ANDA with the U.S. FDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista
several years prior to the expiration of our U.S. patents covering the product,
alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed. In November 2002, we
filed suit against Barr in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Indiana seeking a ruling that Barr’s challenges to our patents claiming the
method of use and pharmaceutical form (expiring from 2012 to 2017) are without
merit. In June 2003, Barr added a challenge to one of our additional patents
(expiring in 2017) claiming a component in the pharmaceutical form of Evista.
That patent has been added to the lawsuit. The suit is in discovery with a
trial date currently proposed for August 2005. While we believe that Barr’s
claims are without merit and expect to prevail, it is not

-11-


possible to predict or determine the outcome of the litigation. Therefore, we
can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could
have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
liquidity, and financial position.

In October 2002, Pfizer Inc. filed a lawsuit in the United States District
Court in Delaware against us, Lilly ICOS LLC, and ICOS Corporation alleging
that the proposed marketing of Cialis for erectile dysfunction would infringe
its newly issued method-of-use patent. In September 2003, the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, on its own initiative, ordered that Pfizer’s patent be
reexamined. The Delaware suit has been stayed pending the outcome of the
reexamination. Previously, Pfizer’s corresponding European method-of-use
patent was held invalid in the first stage of an opposition proceeding in the
European Patent Office. Pfizer is now appealing that decision to the Technical
Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office. A hearing is expected in the
second half of 2004. The U.K. Court of Appeal has previously held the U.K.
counterpart to this patent invalid. Litigation relating to the corresponding
patent is pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and South
Africa. We intend to vigorously defend this litigation and expect to prevail.
However, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this
litigation and therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail.

Product Liability Litigation

We are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability litigation
lawsuits in the United States involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (“DES”)
and thimerosal.

In approximately 115 U.S. actions, including several with multiple claimants,
plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of children or grandchildren of
women who were prescribed DES during pregnancy.

We have been named as a defendant in approximately 315 actions in the U.S.,
involving approximately 820 claimants, brought in various state courts and
federal district courts on behalf of children with autism or other neurological
disorders who received childhood vaccines (manufactured by other companies)
that contained thimerosal, a generic preservative used in certain vaccines in
the U.S. from the 1930’s until approximately 2000. We discovered and developed
thimerosal in the 1920’s. We have been named in the suits even though we
discontinued manufacturing the raw material in 1974 and discontinued selling it
in the United States to vaccine manufacturers in 1992. The lawsuits typically
name the vaccine manufacturers as well as Lilly and other distributors of
thimerosal, and allege that the children’s exposure to thimerosal-containing
vaccines caused their autism or other neurological disorders. We strongly deny
any liability in these cases. There is no credible scientific evidence
establishing a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and
autism or other neurological disorders. In addition, we believe the cases
should not be prosecuted in the courts in which they have been brought because
the underlying claims are subject to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act
of 1986. Implemented in 1988, the Act established a mandatory, federally
administered no-fault claims process for individuals who allege that they were
harmed by the administration of childhood vaccines. Under the Act, claims must
first be brought before the U.S. Court of Claims for an award determination
under the compensation guidelines established pursuant to the Act. Claimants
who are unsatisfied with their awards under the Act may reject the award and
seek traditional judicial remedies.

We have been named in approximately 15 product liability cases in the United
States involving plaintiffs claiming a variety of injuries from the
administration of Zyprexa. Most of the cases allege that the product caused or
contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels. We are vigorously
defending these suits. Our request that the Zyprexa matters pending in federal
courts be consolidated in a Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) before one federal
judge for pre-trial purposes will be considered on March 23, 2004.

-12-


Other Matters

In July 2002, we received a grand jury subpoena for documents from the Office
of Consumer Litigation, Department of Justice, related to our marketing and
promotional practices and physician communications with respect to Evista. We
received a second subpoena seeking additional documents in July 2003. We
continue to cooperate with the government and have provided a broad range of
information concerning our U.S. marketing and promotional practices, including
documents relating to communications with physicians and the remuneration of
physician consultants and advisers. We continue to review and enhance policies
and procedures designed to assure that our marketing and promotional practices
and physician communications comply with promotional laws and regulations. In
recent months, several pharmaceutical companies have received subpoenas from
government agencies with respect to a variety of products, including a number
of neuroscience products. It is possible that other Lilly products, including
Zyprexa, could become subject to investigation. It is possible that the
outcome of the above matters could include criminal charges and fines and/or
civil penalties. We cannot predict or determine the outcome of the above
matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or
penalties that might result from an adverse outcome. It is possible, however,
that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated financial position, liquidity and results of operations.

In August 2003, we received notice that the staff of the SEC is conducting an
investigation into the compliance by Polish subsidiaries of certain
pharmaceutical companies, including Lilly, with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977. The staff has issued subpoenas requesting production of
documents related to the investigation. We are cooperating with the SEC in
responding to the investigation.

In March 1996, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commenced a non-public
antitrust investigation focusing on the pharmaceutical industry practice of
providing discounts or rebates to managed-care organizations and certain other
purchasers. We are cooperating with the investigation and have responded to
two subpoenas from the FTC requesting production of certain documents and other
discovery responses. We have received no additional requests for documents or
information for several years. We believe that all of our actions have been
lawful and proper.

In March 2001, we received a subpoena, issued at the request of the
Commonwealth’s attorney for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for production
of documents related to pricing and Medicaid reimbursement of our products in
Massachusetts. We are not the only pharmaceutical company to receive such a
request. We are cooperating with the inquiry and we believe that all of our
practices have been lawful and proper.

In 2003, three counties in New York (Suffolk, Rockland, and Westchester) sued
Lilly and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers, claiming in general that as
a result of alleged improprieties by the manufacturers in the calculation and
reporting of average wholesale prices for purposes of Medicaid reimbursement,
the counties overpaid their portion of the cost of pharmaceuticals. The suits
seek monetary and other relief, including civil penalties and treble damages.
The three county suits have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the
District of Massachusetts for pretrial proceedings (along with several other
suits to which Lilly is not a party). The Suffolk County case is now the
subject of a pending motion to dismiss, and the Rockland and Westchester cases
are stayed pending the resolution of that motion. While we are vigorously
defending these cases, given their early procedural stage, we cannot predict or
determine the outcome of this litigation, and therefore we can provide no
assurance that we will prevail.

We are also a defendant in other litigation and investigations, including
product liability and patent suits, of a character we regard as normal to our
business.

-13-


While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal
actions and investigations described above, we believe that except as otherwise
specifically noted above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but
could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one
accounting period.
