Part I

Item 1. Business

Eli Lilly and Company (the “Company” or “Registrant”, which may be referred to
as “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in 1901 in Indiana to succeed to the
drug manufacturing business founded in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1876 by
Colonel Eli Lilly. We discover, develop, manufacture, and sell products in one
significant business segment—pharmaceutical products. Operations of our animal
health business segment are not material to our financial statements. We
manufacture and distribute our products through owned or leased facilities in
the United States, Puerto Rico, and 19 other countries. Our products are sold
in approximately 150 countries.

Most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own
scientists, and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to
continue to discover and develop innovative new pharmaceutical products. We
direct our research efforts primarily toward the search for products to
diagnose, prevent and treat human diseases. We also conduct research to find
products to treat diseases in animals and to increase the efficiency of animal
food production.

bacterial infections; Vancocin® HCl, an injectable antibiotic used
primarily to treat staphylococcal infections; and the injectable
antibiotics Nebcin®, Tazidime®, Kefurox®, and Kefzol®, used to treat a
wide range of bacterial infections in the hospital setting; and

Other pharmaceutical products, including the anti-ulcer agent Axid®.

Marketing

We sell most of our products worldwide. We adapt our marketing methods and
product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs.

Pharmaceuticals — United States

In the United States, we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through
approximately 35 independent wholesale distributors. Our marketing policy is
designed to assure that products and relevant medical information are
immediately available to physicians, pharmacies, hospitals, and appropriate
health care professionals throughout the country. Three wholesale distributors
in the United States — AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc.,
and McKesson Corporation — each accounted for between 16 and 17 percent of our
worldwide consolidated net sales in 2002. No other distributor accounted for
more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales. We also sell pharmaceutical
products directly to the United States government and other manufacturers, but
those sales are not material.

We promote our major pharmaceutical products in the United States through sales
representatives who call upon physicians, wholesalers, hospitals, managed-care
organizations, retail pharmacists, and other health care professionals. To
support our sales representatives’ efforts, we advertise in medical and drug
journals, distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians,
and exhibit at medical meetings. In addition, we advertise certain products
directly to consumers in the United States and we maintain web sites with
information about all our major products. Divisions of our sales force are
dedicated to product lines or practice areas, such as primary care,
neuroscience, diabetes care, critical care, cardiovascular, endocrinology, and
oncology. We have entered into licensing arrangements under which other
companies market certain products manufactured by us, such as Darvon, Sarafem,
Axid, Keftab, Lorabid, and Permax.

Large purchasers of pharmaceuticals, such as managed-care groups and government
and long-term care institutions, account for a significant portion of total
pharmaceutical purchases in the United States. We have created special sales
groups to service managed-care organizations, government and long-term care
institutions, hospital contract administrators, and certain retail pharmacies.
In response to competitive pressures, we have entered into arrangements with a
number of these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more
Company products or other cost-sharing arrangements.

-2-


Pharmaceuticals — Outside the United
States

Outside the United States, we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily
through sales representatives. While the products marketed vary from country
to country, neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total
sales. Distribution patterns vary from country to country. In most countries,
we maintain our own sales and distribution organizations. In some countries,
however, we market our products through independent distributors.

Animal Health Products

Our Elanco Animal Health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the
United States to market animal health products. Elanco also has an extensive
sales force outside the United States. Elanco sells its products primarily to
wholesale distributors.

Raw Materials and Product Supply

Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are
available from more than one source. We obtain certain raw materials
principally from only one source. In addition, three of our significant
products are manufactured by others: Actos by Takeda; ReoPro by Centocor; and
Xigris by Lonza Biologics (bulk product) and DSM, N.V. (finished product). If
we were unable to obtain certain materials from present sources, we could
experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or, in
some cases, implemented alternative processes.

The majority of our sales abroad are of products manufactured wholly or in part
abroad. However, a principal source of active ingredients for those
manufactured products continues to be our facilities in the United States.

We seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and maintain
inventory in a way that will allow us to meet all expected product demand while
maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve
efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. However,
pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary
widely from product to product. Consequently, shifting or adding manufacturing
capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital
expenditures. Accordingly, if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns
or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand, we could experience an
interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until
production could be resumed or expanded.

Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual
Property Rights

Overview

Intellectual property protection is, in the aggregate, material to our ability
to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations. We own, have
applied for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents, both in the
United States and in other countries, relating to products, product uses,
formulations, and manufacturing processes. There is no assurance that the
patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been granted
would be found valid if challenged. Moreover, patents relating to particular
products, uses, formulations, or processes do not preclude other manufacturers
from employing alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or
formulations that might successfully compete with our patented products.

-3-


Outside the United States, the standard of intellectual property protection for
pharmaceuticals varies widely. While many countries have reasonably strong
patent laws, other countries currently provide little or no effective
protection for inventions or other intellectual property rights. Under the
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPs) administered
by the World Trade Organization (WTO), over 140 countries have now agreed to
provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to
assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners.
However, in many countries, this agreement will not become fully effective for
many years. It is possible that changes to this agreement will be made in the
future that will diminish or further delay its implementation in developing
countries. It is too soon to assess how much, if at all, we will benefit
commercially from these changes.

When a product patent expires, the patent holder often loses effective market
exclusivity for the product. This can result in very substantial reductions in
sales of the formerly patented product, particularly in the United States.
However, in some cases the innovator company can obtain additional commercial
benefits through manufacturing trade secrets; later-expiring patents on
processes, uses, or formulations; trademark use; or marketing exclusivity that
may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.

Our Intellectual Property Portfolio

We consider patent protection for certain products, processes, and
uses—particularly that relating to Zyprexa, Gemzar, Humalog, Evista, Actos,
ReoPro, Xigris, and Strattera—to be important to our operations. For many of
our products, in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on
manufacturing processes, formulations, or uses that may extend exclusivity
beyond the expiration of the product patent.

United States compound patent expirations include those claiming the respective
active ingredients in Zyprexa, 2011; Humalog, 2013; and ReoPro, 2015. The
Gemzar compound patent in the U.S. expires in 2010, but a use patent covering
treatment of neoplasms with Gemzar is in force until 2012. We hold a number of
U.S. patents covering Evista and its approved uses in osteoporosis prevention
and treatment that we believe should provide us exclusivity in the United
States until at least 2012. In the United States, the Actos compound patent
extends beyond the duration of our co-promotion agreement, which is in force
until 2006. Xigris is a complex glycoprotein biologic product that is produced
through recombinant DNA technology. Xigris is not subject to the Abbreviated
New Drug Application process under the Hatch-Waxman law as described below. In
addition, we hold patents on the DNA materials, certain uses, manufacturing
process, and the glycoprotein itself. We believe the intellectual property
protection for Xigris should provide us marketing exclusivity until 2015. For
Strattera, we hold a use patent in the U.S. for treating attention
deficit-hyperactivity disorder, the sole approved use of the drug. This use
patent expires in 2015 and we have applied for a patent term extension to 2016.

Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider
in the aggregate to be important to our operations. Trademark protection
varies throughout the world, with protection continuing in some countries as
long as the mark is used, and in other countries as long as it is registered.
Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms.

Patent Challenges Under the Hatch-Waxman Act

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly
known as “Hatch-Waxman,” made a complex set of changes to both patent and
new-drug-approval laws in the United States. Before Hatch-Waxman, no drug
could be approved without providing the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)
complete safety and efficacy studies,

i.e.

, a complete New Drug Application
(“NDA”). Hatch-Waxman authorizes the FDA to approve generic versions of
innovative medicines without such information by filing an Abbreviated New Drug
Application (“ANDA”). In an ANDA, the

-4-


generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic
version and the NDA-approved drug — not safety and efficacy.

Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until
after the innovator’s patents expire. However, after the innovator has
marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA
alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s NDA are
invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a “Paragraph IV
certification.” The innovator must then file suit against the generic
manufacturer to protect its patents. If one or more of the NDA-listed patents
are successfully challenged, the first filer of a Paragraph IV certification
may be entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity over all other
generic manufacturers.

In recent years, generic manufacturers have used Paragraph IV certifications
extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals,
and we expect this trend to continue. We are currently in litigation with
numerous generic manufacturers arising from their Paragraph IV certifications
on Zyprexa, Evista, and Sarafem. For more information on the Zyprexa and
Evista patent litigation, see Part 1, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.

Proposals have been introduced in Congress to amend various aspects of
Hatch-Waxman. In general, the proposals appear to be principally designed to
encourage more Paragraph IV challenges to innovator patents and to limit an
innovator’s ability to protect patents. We cannot predict whether any changes
will be made or what impact they would have on our business.

The FDA has recently proposed regulations that represent a substantial
reinterpretation of certain Hatch-Waxman provisions relating to the enforcement
of drug patents. The new FDA interpretation would limit in certain
circumstances the innovator company’s ability to secure a full court review of
drug patent issues raised in a Paragraph IV patent challenge by a generic drug
company before FDA approval would be given to a generic drug. If the proposed
FDA regulations become effective, we do not expect any material impact on the
patent defense for any Lilly product that is subject to a Paragraph IV patent
challenge nor do we expect any material impact on the way in which we conduct
our operations under the Hatch-Waxman Act.

Competition

Our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other
companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Our animal
health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of pharmaceutical,
chemical, and other companies that operate animal health divisions or
subsidiaries.

Important competitive factors include product efficacy, safety and ease of use,
price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, service,
and research and development of new products and processes. If competitors
introduce new products and processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our
products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of
sales, or both. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other
products already on the market or products that are later developed by
competitors. Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far
less in research and development than research-based pharmaceutical companies
and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded
products. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it
normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. In
many countries outside the United States, patent protection is weak or
nonexistent and we must compete with generic or “knockoff” versions of our
products. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy
benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products
offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other
forms of care.

-5-


We believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in
discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet
medical needs, together with our ability to manufacture the products
efficiently and to market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.
There can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will
result in commercially successful products or that our products or processes
will not become outmoded from time to time as a result of products or processes
developed by our competitors.

Government Regulation

Our operations are regulated extensively by the federal government, to some
extent by state governments, and in varying degrees by foreign governments.
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, other federal statutes and
regulations, various state statutes and regulations, and laws and regulations
of foreign governments govern to varying degrees the testing, approval,
production, labeling, distribution, post-market surveillance, advertising,
dissemination of information, and promotion of our products. The lengthy
process of laboratory and clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing
development, and regulatory review necessary for required governmental
approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions
in a given market. Promotion, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution of
pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated in all major world markets.
In addition, our operations are subject to complex federal, state, local, and
foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations. We
anticipate that the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of
current products and the introduction of new products will continue to require
substantial scientific and technical effort, time, and expense and significant
capital investment.

In the United States, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 requires us
to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of certain of our
products under state Medicaid programs. In addition, a model waiver program has
been created administratively that allows states to expand the Medicaid drug
benefit to include low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Other cost containment
measures have been adopted or proposed by federal, state, and local government
entities that provide or pay for health care. In most international markets,
we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost containment programs,
which may include price controls, discounts and rebates, restrictions on
physician prescription levels, restrictions on reimbursement, compulsory
licenses and generic substitution.

In the U.S., we expect branded pharmaceutical products to be subject to
increasing pricing pressures. Our business could be significantly affected by
the current national debate over Medicare reform as well as by actions by
individual states to reduce pharmaceutical costs for Medicaid patients,
seniors, and the uninsured and underinsured. Many proposals now being
considered at the federal and state levels and, in some cases, implemented at
the state level, would result in government agencies demanding discounts and
rebates from pharmaceutical companies that may expressly or implicitly create
price controls on prescription drugs. Also, some U.S. lawmakers are
considering proposals to legalize the wholesale importation of prescription
drugs from Canada, a price-controlled jurisdiction. A number of states have
begun to implement supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their
Medicaid programs. In 2000, the state of Maine enacted legislation that would
extend Medicaid rebates beyond the current Medicaid population. This program
has been upheld by a federal appeals court and is currently under review by the
U.S. Supreme Court. While legal challenges to these and other state programs
have been mounted, it is unknown at this time if the courts will allow them to
continue. If upheld, these types of programs could be adopted by other states.

International operations are also generally subject to extensive price and
market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional
cost-containment measures, including proposals that would directly or
indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our
intellectual property protection.

-6-


We cannot predict whether such proposals will be adopted or the extent to which
our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or
regulatory developments. However, we expect that pressures on pharmaceutical
pricing will continue and likely intensify in the near term.

Research and Development

Our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years. Our
research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and
development of most of the products we offer today. We invest heavily in
research and development because we believe it is critical to our long-term
competitiveness. At the end of 2002, we employed approximately 8,325 people in
pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities, including
a substantial number of physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate
degrees, and highly skilled technical personnel. Our research and development
expenses were $2.02 billion in 2000, $2.24 billion in 2001, and $2.15 billion
in 2002.

We concentrate our pharmaceutical research and development efforts in five
therapeutic categories: central nervous system and related diseases; endocrine
diseases, including diabetes and osteoporosis; cancer; cardiovascular diseases;
and inflammation. However, we remain opportunistic, selectively pursuing
promising leads in other therapeutic areas. We are actively engaged in
biotechnology research programs involving recombinant DNA, proteins, and
genomics (the development of therapeutics through identification of
disease-causing genes and their cellular function). In addition to discovering
and developing new chemical entities, we look for ways to expand the value of
existing products through new uses and formulations that can provide additional
benefits to patients. We also conduct extensive research in the animal
sciences, including animal nutrition and physiology and veterinary medicine.

To supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with independent research
organizations, including educational institutions and research-based
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and we contract with others for the
performance of research in their facilities. We use the services of
physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and other research organizations
worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness
of new products. We actively seek out investments in external research and
technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own
research efforts. These investments can take many forms, including licensing
arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, co-promotion
arrangements, joint ventures, and acquisitions.

Drug development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. On average, only one
out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to
be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine. The
process from discovery to regulatory approval typically takes 10-15 years or
longer. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even
late-stage product candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval.
We believe our investments in research, both internally and in collaboration
with others, have been rewarded by the number of new pharmaceutical compounds
and indications we have in all stages of development. Among our new
investigational compounds in the later stages of development are potential
therapies for male erectile dysfunction, depression, various cancers, stress
urinary incontinence, diabetes and its complications, and anxiety disorder.
Further, we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of
development. We are also developing new uses and formulations for many of our
important currently marketed products, such as Zyprexa, Gemzar, ReoPro, and
Evista.

Quality Assurance

Our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of
our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and
effectiveness. Product quality arises from a total

-7-


commitment to quality in all parts of our operations, including research and
development, purchasing, facilities planning, manufacturing, and distribution.
We have implemented quality-assurance procedures relating to the quality and
integrity of scientific information and production processes.

Control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients,
equipment, facilities, manufacturing methods, packaging materials, and
labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes and on
the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements
and our standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical chemical
analyses, microbiological testing, testing in animals, or a combination.
Additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate quality-assurance
group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing
procedures and systems in the parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates, and
third-party suppliers.

As a result of preapproval plant inspections for Zyprexa IntraMuscular and
Forteo in early 2001, the FDA informed us of a number of observations and
issued a warning letter regarding adherence to current good manufacturing
practices (“cGMP”) regulations. In response, we have been implementing
comprehensive, companywide improvements in our manufacturing operations. In
November 2001, following a reinspection of the manufacturing facilities for
Zyprexa IntraMuscular and Forteo, the FDA noted additional observations,
primarily relating to computer system validation, manufacturing process
reviews, and data handling. In the spring of 2002, as part of cGMP inspection
requirements and pre-approval inspections related to our product pipeline, the
FDA conducted a comprehensive review of eight of our global manufacturing sites
and issued reports summarizing the investigators’ findings. Fifty observations
were noted in the combined inspection reports for the Indianapolis facilities.
The findings primarily related to overly complex quality processes,
insufficient technical expertise and oversight, and our need to improve our
ability to identify the root cause of manufacturing deviations. The number of
observations for the inspections outside Indianapolis ranged from zero to a
maximum of 16 at one site. Two subsequent inspections, in Puerto Rico and
Indianapolis, resulted in no observations at either site. In the fall of 2002,
we provided the FDA with a comprehensive plan to upgrade our manufacturing and
quality operations, particularly at our Indianapolis facilities. We are moving
vigorously to implement the plan and are engaged in discussions with the agency
on our plan and its ongoing implementation. We are preparing for inspections
in two of our Indianapolis facilities.

Although the FDA has not yet cleared all our manufacturing operations, the
agency did approve Strattera and Forteo in November 2002. Approval of Zyprexa
IntraMuscular and Cymbalta™ (a new antidepressant) will depend on resolution of
manufacturing issues in relevant Indianapolis facilities to the FDA’s
satisfaction. The approval of Cialis™ (a treatment for erectile dysfunction)
is not expected to be affected since this product is manufactured outside
Indianapolis. The timeline for resolution of these issues is difficult to
predict. A manufacturer subject to a warning letter that fails to correct cGMP
deficiencies to the agency’s satisfaction could be subject to interruption of
production, recalls, seizures, fines, and other penalties.

Executive Officers of the Company

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive
officers. All executive officers except Mr. Robert A. Armitage have been
employed by the Company in executive positions during the last five years.
Prior to joining Lilly in 1999, Mr. Armitage was a partner in the law firm of
Vinson & Elkins LLP and headed the firm’s intellectual property law practice in
Washington, D.C. Previously, he held various positions at The Upjohn Company,
where he was vice president, corporate intellectual property law, from 1987 to
1993.

The term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual
meeting of the Board of Directors, to be held on April 28, 2003, or on the date
his or her successor is chosen and qualified. No

-8-


director or executive officer of the Company has a “family relationship” with
any other director or executive officer of the Company, as that term is defined
for purposes of this disclosure requirement. There is no understanding between
any executive officer and any other person pursuant to which the executive
officer was selected.

Employees

At the end of 2002, we employed approximately 43,700 people, including
approximately 18,750 employees outside the United States. A substantial number
of our employees have long records of continuous service.

Financial Information Relating to Business
Segments and Classes of Products

You can find financial information relating to our business segments and
classes of products in our 2002 Annual Report at page 30 under “Segment
Information” (page 17 of Exhibit 13 to this Form
10-K). That information is incorporated into this Report by reference.

The relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated net
sales changes from year to year. This is due to several factors, including the
introduction of new products by us and by other manufacturers and the
introduction of generic pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations. In addition,
margins vary for our different products due to various factors, including
differences in the cost to manufacture and market the products, the value of
the products to the marketplace, and government restrictions on pricing and
reimbursement.

Financial Information Relating to Foreign and
Domestic Operations

You can find financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations
in our 2002 Annual Report at page 30 under “Segment Information” (page 17 of
Exhibit 13). That information is incorporated in this Report by reference.

To date, our overall operations abroad have not been significantly deterred by
local restrictions on the transfer of funds from branches and subsidiaries
located abroad, including the availability of dollar exchange. We cannot
predict what effect these restrictions or the other risks inherent in foreign
operations, including possible nationalization, might have on our future
operations or what other restrictions may be imposed in the future. In
addition, changing currency values can either favorably or unfavorably affect
our financial position and results of operations. We actively manage foreign
exchange risk through various hedging techniques including the use of foreign
currency contracts.

Available Information on Our Web Site

We make available through our company web site, free of charge, our company
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as soon as reasonably
practicable after we electronically file them with, or furnish them to, the
SEC. The reports we make available include annual reports on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements,
registration statements, and any amendments to those documents.

Item 2. Properties

Our principal domestic and international executive offices are located in
Indianapolis. At December 31, 2002, we owned 12 production and distribution
facilities in the United States and Puerto Rico. Together with the corporate
administrative offices, these facilities contain an aggregate of approximately
9.6 million square feet of floor area dedicated to production, distribution,
and administration. Major production sites include Indianapolis; Clinton and
Lafayette, Indiana; and Carolina and Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. We also lease
sales and administrative offices in Indianapolis and a number of other cities
located in the United States and abroad.

We own production and distribution facilities in 17 countries outside the
United States and Puerto Rico, containing an aggregate of approximately 4.6
million square feet of floor space. Major production sites include facilities
in the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Spain, Brazil, Italy, and Mexico. We
lease production and warehouse facilities in Puerto Rico and several countries
outside the United States.

Our research and development facilities in the United States consist of
approximately 4.2 million square feet and are located primarily in Indianapolis
and Greenfield, Indiana. Our major research and development facilities abroad
are located in Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Spain and contain
an aggregate of approximately 660,000 square feet.

We believe that none of our properties is subject to any encumbrance, easement,
or other restriction that would detract materially from its value or impair its
use in the operation of the business. The buildings we own are of varying ages
and in good condition.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Zyprexa Patent Litigation

In February 2001, we were notified that Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
had submitted an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) with the U.S. FDA
seeking permission to market a generic version of Zyprexa in various dosage
forms several years prior to the expiration of our U.S. patents for the
product, alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed. On April 2,
2001, we filed suit against Zenith in federal district court in Indianapolis
seeking a ruling that Zenith’s challenge to the U.S. compound patent (expiring
in 2011) is without merit. In May 2001, we were notified that Dr. Reddy’s
Laboratories, Ltd. had also filed an ANDA covering two dosage forms, alleging
that the patents are invalid or not infringed. On June 26, 2001, we filed a
similar patent infringement suit against Reddy in federal district court in
Indianapolis. Thereafter, we were notified that Reddy had filed an ANDA for
additional dosage forms, and in February 2002, we filed an infringement suit in
the same court based on Reddy’s additional ANDA. We received notice in August
2002 of a similar ANDA filing by Teva Pharmaceuticals, and in September 2002,
we filed suit against Teva in the same court. Finally, in February 2003, we
received notice that Reddy had filed an ANDA on the Zydis® formulation of
Zyprexa, and in March 2003, we filed suit against Reddy in the same court.
The cases are consolidated and are in the discovery stage. Trial is currently
scheduled to begin on January 26, 2004. We believe that the generic
manufacturers’ claims are without merit and we expect to prevail in this
litigation. However, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of
this litigation and therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail.
An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.

Other Patent Litigation

In October 2002, we were notified that Barr Laboratories, Inc. had submitted an
ANDA with the U.S. FDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista
several years prior to the expiration of our U.S. patents covering the product,
alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed. On November 26, 2002,
we filed suit against Barr in federal district court in Indianapolis seeking a
ruling that Barr’s challenges to our patents claiming the method of use and
pharmaceutical form (expiring from 2012 to 2017) are without merit. The case
is in discovery with a trial date currently scheduled for February 2005. While
we believe that Barr’s claims are without merit and expect to prevail, it is
not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the litigation. Therefore,
we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could
have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
liquidity, and financial position.

In October 2002, Pfizer Inc. filed a lawsuit in the United States District
Court in Delaware against us, Lilly ICOS LLC, and ICOS Corporation alleging
that the proposed marketing of Cialis for erectile dysfunction would infringe
its newly issued method-of-use patent. Previously, Pfizer’s corresponding
European method-of-use patent was held invalid in the first stage of an
opposition proceeding in the European Patent Office. Pfizer is now appealing
that decision. In addition, the U.K. counterpart to this patent has been held
invalid by the U.K. Court of Appeal. The U.S. case is in the preliminary
stages. We intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit and expect to prevail.
However, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this
litigation and therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail.

Product Liability Litigation

We are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability litigation
lawsuits in the United States involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (“DES”)
and thimerosal.

In approximately 105 actions, including several with multiple claimants,
plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of children or grandchildren of
women who ingested DES during pregnancy.

-11-


In late February 2003, a law firm in San Francisco, California, issued a press
release claiming that it has filed “several” lawsuits and is in the process of
filing “numerous” other suits against the company on behalf of plaintiffs who
claim that they suffered various illnesses as a result of administration of
Zyprexa. We intend to vigorously defend all such suits. As of
March 18, 2003,
only one suit had been served on us.

We have been named as a defendant in over 200 actions in the U.S., including
several that purport to be class actions, brought in various state courts and
federal district courts on behalf of children with autism or other neurological
disorders who received childhood vaccines (manufactured by other companies)
that contained thimerosal, a generic preservative used in certain vaccines in
the U.S. from the 1930’s until approximately 2000. We discovered and developed
thimerosal in the 1920’s. We have been named in the suits even though we
discontinued manufacturing the raw material used to preserve vaccines in 1974
and discontinued selling it in the United States to vaccine manufacturers in
1992. The lawsuits typically name the vaccine manufacturers, Lilly and other
distributors of thimerosal, and allege that the children’s exposure to
thimerosal-containing vaccines caused their autism or other neurological
disorders. We strongly deny any liability in these cases. There is no
scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between
thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism or other neurological disorders. In
addition, we believe the cases should not be prosecuted in the courts in which
they have been brought because the underlying claims are subject to the
National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. Implemented in 1988, the Act
established a mandatory, federally administered no-fault claims process for
individuals who allege that they were harmed by the administration of childhood
vaccines. Under the Act, claims must first be brought before the U.S. Court of
Claims for an award determination under the compensation guidelines established
pursuant to the Act. Claimants who are unsatisfied with their awards under the
Act may reject the award and seek traditional judicial remedies.

Other Matters

In July 2002, we received a grand jury subpoena for documents from the Office
of Consumer Litigation, Department of Justice, related to our marketing of
Evista. The investigation centers on our communications with physicians
regarding existing clinical data assessing the potential for Evista in reducing
the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. It has been alleged that
certain of these communications with physicians regarding these data
constituted unlawful promotion of Evista for indications that are not approved
by the FDA. We are in the process of responding to the subpoena. We have
established a number of policies and procedures designed to ensure that these
types of communications with respect to clinical data comply with all
promotional laws and regulations. However, it is possible that criminal
penalties could be sought in this matter.

In March 1996, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) commenced a non-public
antitrust investigation focusing on the pharmaceutical industry practice of
providing discounts or rebates to managed-care organizations and certain other
purchasers. We have responded to two subpoenas from the FTC requesting
production of certain documents and other discovery responses. We believe that
all of our actions have been lawful and proper and are cooperating with the
investigation.

In March 2001, we received a subpoena, issued at the request of the
Commonwealth’s attorney for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for production
of documents related to pricing and Medicaid reimbursement of our products in
Massachusetts. We believe that we are not the only pharmaceutical company to
receive such a request. We are cooperating with the inquiry and we believe
that all of our practices have been lawful and proper.

We were named as a defendant along with many other pharmaceutical manufacturers
in lawsuits in federal district court for the district of Massachusetts (served
on us in December 2001) and in federal district court for the eastern district
of Pennsylvania (served on us in May 2002). The suits purported to be
nationwide class actions on behalf of consumers of certain prescription drugs,
claiming in general that

-12-


as a result of alleged improprieties in the calculation and reporting of
average wholesale prices for purposes of Medicare reimbursement, consumers
overpaid their portion of the cost of the drugs. The two suits were thereafter
consolidated as part of a multi-district litigation (“MDL”) in the district of
Massachusetts, In

re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price
Litigation,

MDL No. 1456. In September 2002, the plaintiffs filed a
consolidated master complaint in the MDL and did not name us as a defendant.
Thus, we are no longer a party to the MDL action. We have also been named as a
defendant along with many other manufacturers in similar suits brought in state
courts in Montana and Nevada by the attorneys general of those two states. The
suits seek damages on behalf of both the respective states as health care
payers and consumers of certain prescription drugs in those states. The
Montana suit was brought in state court in Montana in February 2002 and the
Nevada suit was brought in a Nevada state court in March 2002. In January
2003, a similar suit was filed against us and several other pharmaceutical
manufacturers by the local government of Suffolk County, New York, in the
federal district court for the Eastern District of New York. We believe that
all of our practices in this regard have been lawful and proper and that these
suits are without merit. However, it is impossible to predict or determine the
outcome of this litigation and, accordingly, we can provide no assurance that
we will prevail.

We are also a defendant in other litigation and investigations, including
product liability and patent suits, of a character we regard as normal to our
business.

While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal
actions and investigations pending against us, we believe that except as
noted above with respect to the Zyprexa and Evista patent litigation, the
costs associated with all such matters will not have a material adverse effect
on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be
material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting
period.

Item 14. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

Under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, the principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of a reporting company are
required to periodically review the company’s “disclosure controls and
procedures,” which are defined generally as controls and other procedures of a
reporting company designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the reporting company in its periodic reports filed with the Commission
(such as this Form 10-K) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a
timely basis.

As of March 19, 2003 (the “Evaluation Date”), Sidney Taurel, chairman,
president, and chief executive officer, and Charles E. Golden, executive vice
president and chief financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and
procedures and concluded that they are effective.
