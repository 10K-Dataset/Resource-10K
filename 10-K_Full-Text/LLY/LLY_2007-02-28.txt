Part I

Item 1.

Business

Eli Lilly and Company (the “Company” or
    “Registrant”, which may be referred to as
    “we”, “us”, or “our”) was
    incorporated in 1901 in Indiana to succeed to the drug
    manufacturing business founded in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1876
    by Colonel Eli Lilly. We discover, develop, manufacture, and
    sell products in one significant business segment —
    pharmaceutical products. We also have an animal health business
    segment, whose operations are not material to our financial
    statements. We manufacture and distribute our products through
    owned or leased facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico,
    and 25 other countries. Our products are sold in approximately
    140 countries.

Most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed
    by our own scientists, and our success depends to a great extent
    on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative
    new pharmaceutical products. We direct our research efforts
    primarily toward the search for products to prevent and treat
    human diseases. We also conduct research to find products to
    treat diseases in animals and to increase the efficiency of
    animal food production.

Marketing

We sell most of our products worldwide. We adapt our marketing
    methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local
    needs.

Pharmaceuticals –
    United States

In the United States, we distribute pharmaceutical products
    principally through independent wholesale distributors, with
    some sales directly to pharmacies. Our marketing policy is
    designed to assure that products and relevant medical
    information are immediately available to physicians, pharmacies,
    hospitals, public and private payers, and appropriate health
    care professionals throughout the country. Three wholesale
    distributors in the United States – AmerisourceBergen
    Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and McKesson
    Corporation – each accounted for between 14 and
    21 percent of our worldwide consolidated net sales in 2006.
    No other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of
    consolidated net sales. We also sell pharmaceutical products
    directly to the United States government and other
    manufacturers, but those sales are not material.

We promote our major pharmaceutical products in the United
    States through sales representatives who call upon physicians,
    wholesalers, hospitals, managed-care organizations, retail
    pharmacists, and other health care

-2-

professionals. We advertise in medical and drug journals,
    distribute literature and samples of certain products to
    physicians, and exhibit at medical meetings. In addition, we
    advertise certain products directly to consumers in the United
    States and we maintain web sites with information about all our
    major products. Divisions of our sales force are assigned to
    therapeutic areas, such as neuroscience, diabetes, osteoporosis,
    critical care, and oncology.

Large purchasers of pharmaceuticals, such as managed-care
    groups, government agencies, and long-term care institutions,
    account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical
    purchases in the United States. We have created special business
    groups to service managed-care organizations, government and
    long-term care institutions, hospital contract administrators,
    and certain retail pharmacies. In response to competitive
    pressures, we have entered into arrangements with a number of
    these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or
    more Lilly products.

Pharmaceuticals –
    Outside the United States

Outside the United States, we promote our pharmaceutical
    products primarily through sales representatives. While the
    products marketed vary from country to country, neuroscience
    products constitute the largest single group in total sales.
    Distribution patterns vary from country to country. In most
    countries, we maintain our own sales organizations. In some
    countries, however, we market our products through independent
    distributors.

Pharmaceutical
    Marketing Collaborations

Several of our significant products are marketed in
    collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies:

•

Cymbalta is co-promoted in the United States by Quintiles
    Transnational Corp. and is co-promoted or co-marketed outside
    the U.S. (except Japan) by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH.

•

Through January 2007, Cialis was sold in North America and most
    of Europe by a joint venture between Lilly and
    ICOS Corporation, and was sold by us alone in other
    territories. On January 29, 2007, we acquired all the
    outstanding common stock of ICOS. Following the acquisition,
    Cialis is sold by Lilly in all territories.

•

We co-promoted Actos with a unit of Takeda Chemical Industries
    Ltd. in the United States until our U.S. marketing rights
    expired in September 2006; however, we will receive residual
    royalties on U.S. Actos sales for three years thereafter.
    We continue to have exclusive and semi-exclusive marketing
    rights to Actos in other countries.

•

We co-promote Byetta with Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in
    the United States and Puerto Rico, and we have exclusive
    marketing rights in other territories.

We have also entered into licensing arrangements under which we
    have granted exclusive marketing rights to other companies in
    specified countries for certain older products manufactured by
    us, such as Ceclor and Vancocin.

Animal
    Health Products

Our Elanco Animal Health business unit employs field salespeople
    throughout the United States to market animal health products.
    Elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the United
    States. Elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale
    distributors.

Competition

Our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured
    by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout
    the world. Our animal health products compete on a worldwide
    basis with products of animal health care companies as well as
    pharmaceutical, chemical, and other companies that operate
    animal health divisions or subsidiaries.

-3-

Important competitive factors include product efficacy, safety,
    and ease of use, price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness,
    marketing effectiveness, service, and research and development
    of new products and processes. If competitors introduce new
    products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost
    advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price
    reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new
    products that we introduce must compete with other products
    already on the market or products that are later developed by
    competitors. Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically
    invest far less in research and development than research-based
    pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products
    significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a
    branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces
    intense price competition from generic forms of the product. In
    many countries outside the United States, patent protection is
    weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic or
    “knockoff” versions of our products. To successfully
    compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits
    management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our
    products offer not only medical benefits but also cost
    advantages as compared with other forms of care.

We believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our
    success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective
    products that serve unmet medical needs, together with our
    ability to continuously improve the productivity of our
    discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing and support
    operations in a highly competitive environment. There can be no
    assurance that our research and development efforts will result
    in commercially successful products or that our products or
    processes will not become uncompetitive from time to time as a
    result of products or processes developed by our competitors.

Patents,
    Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights

Overview

Intellectual property protection is, in the aggregate, material
    to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences
    innovations. We own, have applied for, or are licensed under, a
    large number of patents, both in the United States and in other
    countries, relating to products, product uses, formulations, and
    manufacturing processes. There is no assurance that the patents
    we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been
    granted would be found valid and enforceable if challenged.
    Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses,
    formulations, or processes do not preclude other manufacturers
    from employing alternative processes or from marketing
    alternative products or formulations that might successfully
    compete with our patented products. In addition, from time to
    time, competitors or other third parties assert claims that our
    activities infringe patents or other intellectual property
    rights held by them. While there can be no assurance, we do not
    believe that any such claims will have a material adverse effect
    on our results of operations, liquidity, or financial position.

Outside the United States, the adequacy and effectiveness of
    intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies
    widely. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
    Agreement (TRIPs) administered by the World Trade Organization
    (WTO), over 140 countries have now agreed to provide
    non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions
    and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available
    to all patent owners. However, in many countries, this agreement
    will not become fully effective for many years. It is still too
    soon to assess when and how much, if at all, we will benefit
    commercially from these changes.

When a product patent expires, the patent holder often loses
    effective market exclusivity for the product. This can result in
    a severe and rapid decline in sales of the formerly patented
    product, particularly in the United States. However, in some
    cases the innovator company may achieve exclusivity beyond the
    expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade
    secrets; later-expiring patents on methods of use or
    formulations; or data-based exclusivity that may be available
    under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.

Our
    Intellectual Property Portfolio

We consider intellectual property protection for certain
    products, processes, and uses – particularly those
    products discussed below – to be important to our
    operations. For many of our products, in addition to the
    compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing
    processes, formulations, or uses that may extend exclusivity
    beyond the expiration of the product patent.

-4-

We have the following U.S. patent protection for major
    marketed products:

•

Alimta.

We expect the U.S. compound patent for
    Alimta will expire in 2016.

•

Byetta.

Relevant patents covering Byetta are
    exclusively licensed or owned by our partner Amylin
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. A method of use patent focused on the
    treatment of type 2 diabetes is expected to expire in the
    U.S. in 2017. In addition, a patent covering the Byetta
    formulation will expire in the U.S. in 2020.

•

Cialis.

For Cialis, compound and

method-of-use

patent protection exists in the U.S. that should provide
    exclusivity until 2017.

•

Cymbalta.

For Cymbalta, we expect the
    U.S. compound patent will expire in 2013. We also have a
    formulation patent for Cymbalta until 2014.

•

Evista.

We hold a number of U.S. patents
    covering Evista and its approved uses in osteoporosis prevention
    and treatment that we believe should provide us exclusivity in
    the United States until 2014.

•

Gemzar.

The Gemzar compound patent in the
    U.S. expires in 2010, and a

method-of-use

patent covering treatment of neoplasms with Gemzar is in force
    until 2012. We have also received an additional six months of
    marketing exclusivity for Gemzar from the FDA under the terms of
    the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, as a
    result of our conducting clinical studies of Gemzar in pediatric
    populations, which should provide us exclusivity until 2013.

•

Humalog.

The Humalog compound patent will expire in
    2013.

•

Strattera.

For Strattera, a

method-of-use

patent in the U.S. for treating attention
    deficit-hyperactivity disorder should provide exclusivity until
    2016.

•

Xigris.

Xigris is a complex glycoprotein biologic
    product that is produced through recombinant DNA technology.
    Xigris is not subject to the Abbreviated New Drug Application
    process under the Hatch-Waxman law as described below. In
    addition, we hold patents on the DNA materials, certain uses,
    manufacturing process, and the glycoprotein itself. We believe
    the intellectual property protection for Xigris should provide
    us marketing exclusivity in the U.S. until 2015.

•

Zyprexa.

The Zyprexa compound patent will expire in
    2011.

Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks
    that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our
    operations. Trademark protection varies throughout the world,
    with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark
    is used, and in other countries as long as it is registered.
    Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms.

Patent
    Challenges Under the Hatch-Waxman Act

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of
    1984, commonly known as “Hatch-Waxman,” made a complex
    set of changes to both patent and new-drug-approval laws in the
    United States. Before Hatch-Waxman, no drug could be approved
    without providing the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
    complete safety and efficacy studies,

i.e.

, a complete
    New Drug Application (NDA). Hatch-Waxman authorizes the FDA to
    approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other
    than biological products) without such information by filing an
    Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). In an ANDA, the generic
    manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence”
    between the generic version and the NDA-approved
    drug – not safety and efficacy.

Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an
    ANDA until after the innovator’s patents expire. However,
    after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a
    generic manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that one or more
    of the patents listed in the innovator’s NDA are invalid or
    not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a
    “Paragraph IV certification.” The innovator must
    then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its
    patents. If one or more of the NDA-listed patents are
    successfully

-5-

challenged, the first filer of a Paragraph IV certification
    may be entitled to a

180-day

period of market exclusivity over all other generic
    manufacturers.

In recent years, generic manufacturers have used
    Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge
    patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals, and we
    expect this trend to continue. We are currently in litigation
    with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their
    Paragraph IV certifications on Zyprexa, Evista, and Gemzar.
    For more information on these, see Part II, Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis –
    Legal and Regulatory Matters.”

Government
    Regulation

Regulation
    of Our Operations

Our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national,
    state and local agencies. The lengthy process of laboratory and
    clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing development, and
    regulatory review necessary for required governmental approvals
    is extremely costly and can significantly delay product
    introductions in a given market. Promotion, marketing,
    manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical and animal
    health products are extensively regulated in all major world
    markets. We are required to conduct extensive post-marketing
    surveillance of the safety of the products we sell. In addition,
    our operations are subject to complex federal, state, local, and
    foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment,
    occupational health and safety, and privacy. The laws and
    regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current
    products and the discovery, development and introduction of new
    products will continue to require substantial scientific and
    technical effort, time, and expense and significant capital
    investment.

Of particular importance is the FDA in the United States.
    Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA
    has jurisdiction over all of our products and administers
    requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness,
    manufacturing, quality control, distribution, labeling,
    marketing, advertising, dissemination of information and
    post-marketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products. The
    FDA, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),
    also regulates our animal health products. The
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also regulates some
    animal health products.

Outside the United States, our products and operations are
    subject to similar regulatory requirements, notably by the
    European Medicines Agency (EMEA) in the European Union and the
    Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan.
    Regulatory requirements vary from country to country.

The FDA extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing
    quality under its current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)
    regulations. In recent years, we have made, and we continue to
    make, substantial investments of capital and operating expenses
    to implement comprehensive, company-wide improvements in our
    manufacturing, product and process development, and quality
    operations to ensure sustained cGMP compliance. However, in the
    event we fail to adhere to cGMP requirements in the future, we
    could be subject to interruptions in production, fines and
    penalties, and delays in new product approvals.

The marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of
    pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which
    manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers, are
    subject to various other federal and state laws, including the
    federal anti-kickback statute and the False Claims Act and state
    laws governing kickbacks, false claims, unfair trade practices,
    and consumer protection. These laws are administered by, among
    others, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector
    General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the
    Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Personnel Management and
    state attorneys general. Over the past several years, both the
    FDA and many of these other agencies have increased their
    enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies.
    Over this period, several cases brought by these agencies
    against Lilly and other companies under these and other laws
    have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very
    substantial civil settlements. Several pharmaceutical companies,
    including Lilly, are currently subject to proceedings by one or
    more of these agencies regarding marketing and promotional
    practices. See Part II, Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis –
    Legal and Regulatory Matters,” for information about
    currently pending marketing and promotional practices
    investigations in which we are involved. It is possible that we
    could become subject to additional administrative and legal
    proceedings and actions, which could

-6-

include claims for civil penalties (including treble damages
    under the False Claims Act), criminal sanctions, and
    administrative remedies, including exclusion from federal health
    care programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in such an
    action could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
    results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.

Regulations
    Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement

In the United States, we are required to provide rebates to
    state governments on their purchases of certain of our products
    under state Medicaid programs. Other cost containment measures
    have been adopted or proposed by federal, state, and local
    government entities that provide or pay for health care. In most
    international markets, we operate in an environment of
    government-mandated cost containment programs, which may include
    price controls, reference pricing, discounts and rebates,
    restrictions on physician prescription levels, restrictions on
    reimbursement, compulsory licenses, health economic assessments,
    and generic substitution.

In the U.S., implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug,
    Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), providing a
    prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program, took
    effect January 1, 2006. See Part II, Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis –
    Executive Overview – Legal and Governmental
    Matters” for a discussion of the impact of MMA and other
    federal and state healthcare cost containment measures.

International operations are also generally subject to extensive
    price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for
    additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that
    would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or
    reduce the value of our intellectual property protection.

We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be
    affected by these or other potential future legislative or
    regulatory developments. However, we expect that pressures on
    pharmaceutical pricing will continue to increase.

Research
    and Development

Our commitment to research and development dates back more than
    100 years. Our research and development activities are
    responsible for the discovery and development of most of the
    products we offer today. We invest heavily in research and
    development because we believe it is critical to our long-term
    competitiveness. At the end of 2006, we employed approximately
    8,300 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research
    and development activities, including a substantial number of
    physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees,
    and highly skilled technical personnel. Our research and
    development expenses were $2.69 billion in 2004,
    $3.03 billion in 2005, and $3.13 billion in 2006.

Our pharmaceutical research and development focuses on four
    therapeutic categories: central nervous system and related
    diseases; endocrine diseases, including diabetes, obesity and
    musculoskeletal disorders; cancer; and cardiovascular diseases.
    However, we remain opportunistic, selectively pursuing promising
    leads in other therapeutic areas. We are actively engaged in
    biotechnology research programs involving recombinant DNA,
    therapeutic proteins and antibodies as well as genomics (the
    development of therapeutics through identification of
    disease-causing genes and their cellular function), biomarkers,
    and targeted therapeutics. In addition to discovering and
    developing new chemical entities, we look for ways to expand the
    value of existing products through new uses and formulations
    that can provide additional benefits to patients. We also
    conduct research in animal health, including animal nutrition
    and physiology, control of parasites, and veterinary medicine.

To supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others,
    including educational institutions and research-based
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and we contract with
    others for the performance of research in their facilities. We
    use the services of physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and
    other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical
    trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our
    products. We actively seek out investments in external research
    and technologies that hold the promise to complement and
    strengthen our own research efforts. These investments can take
    many forms, including licensing arrangements, co-development and
    co-marketing agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint
    ventures, and acquisitions.

Drug development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. On
    average, only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds
    discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective
    and safe enough to become an approved medicine. The process from
    discovery to regulatory approval typically takes 12 to
    15 years or longer. Drug candidates can fail at any stage
    of the process, and even late-stage drug candidates sometimes
    fail to receive regulatory approval. Even after approval and
    launch of a product, we expend considerable resources on
    post-marketing surveillance and clinical studies. We believe our
    investments in research, both internally and in collaboration
    with others, have been rewarded by the number of new compounds
    and new indications for existing compounds that we have in all
    stages of development. Among our new investigational compounds
    in the later stages of development are potential therapies for
    diabetes and its complications, osteoporosis, cancer, and acute
    coronary syndromes. Further, we are studying many other drug
    candidates in the earlier stages of development, including
    compounds targeting cancers, thrombotic disorders, diabetes,
    obesity, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, depression,
    pain and migraine, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
    (ADHD), alcoholism, sleep disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis.
    We are also developing new uses and formulations for many of our
    currently marketed products, such as Zyprexa, Cymbalta, Gemzar,
    Alimta, Cialis, Evista, Forteo, and Byetta.

Raw
    Materials and Product Supply

Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing
    operations are available from more than one source. We obtain
    certain raw materials principally from only one source. In
    addition, four of our significant products are manufactured by
    others: Actos by Takeda; ReoPro by Centocor; Xigris by Lonza
    Biologics (bulk product) and DSM, N.V. (finished product); and
    Byetta by third-party suppliers to Amylin. If we were unable to
    obtain certain materials from present sources, we could
    experience an interruption in supply until we established new
    sources or, in some cases, implemented alternative processes.

Our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at three sites in Indiana
    as well as locations in Ireland, Puerto Rico, and the United
    Kingdom. Finishing operations, including labeling and packaging,
    take place at a number of sites throughout the world.

We seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and
    maintain inventory in a way that will allow us to meet all
    expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to
    reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and
    respond to changes in supply and demand. However, pharmaceutical
    production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary
    widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing
    capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant
    capital expenditures and regulatory approvals. Accordingly, if
    we were to experience extended plant shutdowns or extraordinary
    unplanned increases in demand, we could experience an
    interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages
    until production could be resumed or expanded.

Quality
    Assurance

Our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in
    the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data
    that support their safety and effectiveness. Product quality
    arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our
    operations, including research and development, purchasing,
    facilities planning, manufacturing, and distribution. We have
    implemented quality-assurance procedures relating to the quality
    and integrity of scientific information and production processes.

Control of production processes involves rigid specifications
    for ingredients, equipment, facilities, manufacturing methods,
    packaging materials, and labeling. We perform tests at various
    stages of production processes and on the final product to
    assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and
    our standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical
    chemical analyses, microbiological testing, testing in animals,
    or a combination. Additional assurance of quality is provided by
    a corporate quality-assurance group that monitors existing
    pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and
    systems in the parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates, and
    third-party suppliers.

Employees

At the end of 2006, we employed approximately
    41,500 people, including approximately 19,500 employees
    outside the United States. A substantial number of our employees
    have long records of continuous service.

Financial
    Information Relating to Business Segments and Classes of
    Products

You can find financial information relating to our business
    segments and classes of products in Part II, Item 8 of
    this

Form 10-K,

“Segment Information.” That information is
    incorporated here by reference.

The relative contribution of any particular product to our
    consolidated net sales changes from year to year. This is due to
    several factors, including the introduction of new products by
    us and by other manufacturers and the introduction of generic
    pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations. In addition, margins
    vary for our different products due to various factors,
    including differences in the cost to manufacture and market the
    products, the value of the products to the marketplace, and
    government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement. Our major
    product sales are generally not seasonal.

Financial
    Information Relating to Foreign and Domestic
    Operations

You can find financial information relating to foreign and
    domestic operations in Part II, Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

“Segment Information.” That information is
    incorporated here by reference.

To date, our overall operations abroad have not been
    significantly deterred by local restrictions on the transfer of
    funds from branches and subsidiaries located abroad, including
    the availability of dollar exchange. We cannot predict what
    effect these restrictions or the other risks inherent in foreign
    operations, including possible nationalization, might have on
    our future operations or what other restrictions may be imposed
    in the future.

-9-

In addition, changing currency values can either favorably or
    unfavorably affect our financial position and results of
    operations. We actively manage foreign exchange risk through
    various hedging techniques including the use of foreign currency
    contracts.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking
    Statements

In addition to the other information contained in this

Form 10-K,

the following risk factors should be considered carefully in
    evaluating our company. It is possible that our business,
    financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be
    materially adversely affected by any of these risks.

We have made certain forward-looking statements in this

Form 10-K,

and company spokespeople may make such statements in the future
    based on then-current expectations of management. Where
    possible, we try to identify forward-looking statements by using
    such words as “expect,” “plan,”
    “will,” “estimate,” “forecast,”
    “project,” “believe,”
    “anticipate,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking
    statements do not relate strictly to historical or current
    facts. They are likely to address our growth strategy, sales of
    current and anticipated products, financial results, the results
    of our research and development programs, the status of product
    approvals, and the outcome of contingencies such as litigation
    and investigations. All forward-looking statements made by us
    are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those
    summarized below.

•

We face intense competition.

We compete with large
    number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology
    companies and generic pharmaceutical companies. To compete
    successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market
    innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical
    needs. Our product sales can be adversely affected by the
    introduction by competitors of branded products that are
    perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic versions of
    our branded products, and by generic versions of other products
    in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. See
    Item 1, “Business – Competition,” for
    more details.

•

Our long-term success depends on intellectual property
    protection.

Our long-term success depends on our
    ability to continually discover, develop, and commercialize
    innovative new pharmaceutical products. Without strong
    intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate
    the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in
    research and development, capital, and other expenditures
    required to bring new drugs to the market. We currently expect
    no major patent expirations in this decade, but several major
    products will lose intellectual property protection in the first
    half of the next decade.

Intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and
    is subject to change over time. In the U.S., the Hatch-Waxman
    Act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to
    invalidate our patents; as a result, we expect that our
    U.S. patents on major products will be routinely
    challenged, and there can be no assurance that our patents will
    be upheld. See Item 1, “Business – Patents,
    Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Protection”,
    for more details. In addition, competitors or other third
    parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other
    intellectual property rights held by them. If successful, such

-10-

claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a
    particular territory or being required to pay damages for past
    infringement or royalties on future sales.

•

Our business is subject to increasing government price
    controls and other health care cost containment
    measures.

Government health care cost-containment
    measures can significantly affect our sales and profitability.
    In many countries outside the United States, government agencies
    strictly control, directly or indirectly, the prices at which
    our products are sold. In the United States, we are subject to
    substantial pricing pressures from state Medicaid programs and
    private insurance programs, including those operating under the
    Medicare pharmaceutical benefit effective January 2006. We
    expect pricing pressures to increase. See Item I,
    “Business – Regulations Affecting Pharmaceutical
    Pricing and Reimbursement” for more details.

•

Pharmaceutical research and development is costly and
    uncertain.

There are many difficulties and uncertainties
    inherent in new product research and development and the
    introduction of new products. There is a high rate of failure
    inherent in the research to develop new drugs to treat diseases.
    To bring a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to
    market may take a decade or more and failure can occur at any
    point in the process, including later in the process after
    significant funds have been invested. As a result, there is a
    significant risk that funds invested in research programs will
    not generate financial returns. New product candidates that
    appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or
    may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or
    safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory
    approvals, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or
    excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents
    or intellectual property rights of others. Delays and
    uncertainties in the FDA approval process and the approval
    processes in other countries can result in delays in product
    launches and lost market opportunity. In addition, it can be
    very difficult to predict sales growth rates of new products.

•

Pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or
    efficacy concerns.

Unexpected safety or efficacy
    concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, whether or
    not scientifically justified, leading to product recalls,
    withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as product liability
    claims.

•

We depend on key products for most of our revenues, cash
    flows, and earnings.

Zyprexa sales of
    $4.417 billion represented 28 percent of our revenues
    in 2006. Four other products – Gemzar, Cymbalta,
    Humalog, and Evista – each contributed more than
    $1 billion in revenues in 2006. If these or any of our
    other key products were to become subject to a problem such as
    loss of patent protection, materially adverse changes in
    prescription growth rates, unexpected side effects, regulatory
    proceedings, material product liability litigation, publicity
    affecting doctor or patient confidence, or pressure from
    competitive products, the adverse impact on our revenues, cash
    flows and earnings could be significant.

•

Regulatory compliance failures could be damaging to the
    company.

The marketing, promotional, and pricing
    practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner
    in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers,
    and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. Many
    companies, including Lilly, have been subject to claims related
    to these practices asserted by federal and state governmental
    authorities and private payors and consumers. These claims could
    result in substantial expense to the company. In particular, See
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis – Legal and Regulatory Matters”, for the
    discussions of the U.S. sales and marketing practices
    investigations. In addition, regulatory issues concerning
    compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)
    regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product
    recalls and seizures, interruption of production leading to
    product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products
    pending resolution of the cGMP issues. See Item 1,
    “Business – Regulation of our Operations”,
    for more details.

•

We face many product liability claims today, and future
    claims will be largely self-insured.

We are subject to
    a substantial number of product liability claims involving
    primarily Zyprexa, DES, and thimerosal, and because of the
    nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could
    become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for
    other products in the future. See Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis –
    Legal and Regulatory Matters” and Item 3, “Legal
    Proceedings”, for more information on our current product
    liability litigation. In the past few years, we have experienced
    difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a
    very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially
    all our

-11-

currently marketed products we have been and expect that we will
    continue to be largely self-insured for future product liability
    losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able
    to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims.

•

Manufacturing difficulties could lead to product supply
    problems.

Pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and
    highly regulated. Manufacturing difficulties can result in
    product shortages, leading to lost sales. See Item 1,
    “Business – Raw Materials and Product
    Supply,” for more details.

•

We face other risks to our business and operating
    results.

Our business is subject to a number of other
    risks and uncertainties, including:

•

Economic factors over which we have no control, including
    changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency
    exchange rates, and overall economic conditions in volatile
    areas can affect our results of operations.

•

Changes in tax laws, including laws related to the remittance of
    foreign earnings or investments in foreign countries with
    favorable tax rates, and settlements of federal, state, and
    foreign tax audits, can affect our net income.

•

Changes in accounting standards promulgated by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange
    Commission, and the Emerging Issues Task Force can affect
    reported results.

•

Our results can also be affected by internal factors, such as
    changes in business strategies and the impact of restructurings,
    asset impairments, technology acquisition and disposition
    transactions, and business combinations.

We undertake no duty to update forward-looking statements.

Properties

Our principal domestic and international executive offices are
    located in Indianapolis. At December 31, 2006, we owned 13
    production and distribution facilities in the United States and
    Puerto Rico. Together with the corporate administrative offices,
    these facilities contain an aggregate of approximately
    11.7 million square feet of floor area dedicated to
    production, distribution, and administration. Major production
    sites include Indianapolis; Clinton and Lafayette, Indiana; and
    Carolina and Guayama, Puerto Rico.

We own production and distribution facilities in 15 countries
    outside the United States and Puerto Rico, containing an
    aggregate of approximately 3.9 million square feet of floor
    space. Major production sites include facilities in France,
    Ireland, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.
    We lease production and warehouse facilities in Puerto Rico and
    several countries outside the United States.

Our research and development facilities in the United States
    consist of approximately 4.9 million square feet and are
    located primarily in Indianapolis and Greenfield, Indiana. Our
    major research and development facilities abroad are located in
    United Kingdom, Canada, Singapore, Spain, Belgium, and Germany,
    and contain an aggregate of approximately 700,000 square
    feet. The sites in Belgium and Germany, containing an aggregate
    of approximately 375,000 square feet, are scheduled to
    close in 2007.

We believe that none of our properties is subject to any
    encumbrance, easement, or other restriction that would detract
    materially from its value or impair its use in the operation of
    the business. The buildings we own are of varying ages and in
    good condition.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are a party to various currently pending legal actions,
    government investigations, and environmental proceedings, and we
    anticipate that such actions could be brought against us in the
    future. The most significant of these matters are described
    below or, as noted, in Part II, Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis –
    Legal and Regulatory Matters.” While it is not possible to
    predict or determine the outcome of the legal actions,
    investigations and proceedings brought against us, we believe
    that, except as otherwise specifically noted in Part II,
    Item 7, the resolution of all such matters will not have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated
    results of operations in any one accounting period.

Legal
    Proceedings Described in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis

See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis – Legal and Regulatory
    Matters,” for information on various legal proceedings,
    including but not limited to:

•

The U.S. patent litigation involving Zyprexa, Evista,
    Gemzar, and Xigris

•

The civil investigation by the U.S. Attorney for the
    Eastern District of Pennsylvania relating to our
    U.S. sales, marketing, and promotional practices

•

The Zyprexa product liability and related litigation, including
    claims brought on behalf of healthcare payors

•

The suits we have filed against several of our product liability
    insurance carriers with respect to our coverage for the Zyprexa
    product liability claims

That information is incorporated into this Item by reference.

Other
    Patent Litigation

During 2005, two generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, Apotex
    Inc. (Apotex) and Novopharm Ltd. (Novopharm) (a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Teva), challenged the validity of our Zyprexa
    compound and

method-of-use

patent (expiring in 2011) in Canada. The generic companies
    allege that our patent is invalid, obtained by fraud, or
    irrelevant. We currently anticipate a decision from the Canadian
    Federal Patent Court by April 2007 in the Apotex case and by
    September 2007 in the Novopharm case. In May 2004,
    Egis-Gyogyszergyar, a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer,
    challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and

method-of-use

patents (expiring in 2011) in Germany. We currently
    anticipate a decision from the German Patent Court in the second
    or third quarter of 2007. We have received challenges to Zyprexa
    patents in a number of other countries as well, including
    several Eastern European countries. We are vigorously contesting
    the various legal challenges to our Zyprexa patents. We cannot
    predict or determine the outcome of this litigation.

In October 2002, Pfizer Inc. filed a lawsuit in the United
    States District Court in Delaware against us, Lilly ICOS LLC,
    and ICOS Corporation alleging that the proposed marketing
    of Cialis for erectile dysfunction would infringe its newly
    issued

method-of-use

patent. In September 2003, the U.S. Patent and Trademark
    Office ordered that Pfizer’s patent be reexamined and in
    March 2006, the PTO finally rejected the broad

method-of-use

claim. Pfizer is appealing that decision. Meanwhile, the
    Delaware suit has been stayed pending the final outcome of the
    reexamination. In the U.K., European Union and Australia, this
    same patent has been held finally invalid and Pfizer has revoked
    this patent in New Zealand and South Africa. In Brazil, Pfizer
    is appealing a lower court decision holding this patent invalid.
    In Mexico and Canada infringement and nullification actions are
    still pending. We intend to vigorously defend this litigation
    and expect to prevail. However, it is not possible to predict or
    determine the outcome of this litigation.

Other
    Product Liability Litigation

We are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability
    lawsuits in the United States involving primarily Zyprexa,
    diethylstilbestrol (“DES”) and thimerosal.

-13-

In approximately 85 U.S. actions involving approximately
    140 claimants, plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of
    children or grandchildren of women who were prescribed DES
    during pregnancy.

We have been named as a defendant in approximately 355 actions
    in the U.S., involving approximately 930 claimants, brought in
    various state courts and federal district courts on behalf of
    children with autism or other neurological disorders who
    received childhood vaccines (manufactured by other companies)
    that contained thimerosal, a generic preservative used in
    certain vaccines in the U.S. beginning in the 1930s. We
    purchased patents and conducted research pertaining to
    thimerosal in the 1920s. We have been named in the suits even
    though we discontinued manufacturing the raw material in 1974
    and discontinued selling it in the United States to vaccine
    manufacturers in 1992. The lawsuits typically name the vaccine
    manufacturers as well as Lilly and other distributors of
    thimerosal, and allege that the children’s exposure to
    thimerosal-containing vaccines caused their autism or other
    neurological disorders. We strongly deny any liability in these
    cases. There is no credible scientific evidence establishing a
    causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and
    autism or other neurological disorders. In addition, we believe
    the majority of the cases should not be prosecuted in the courts
    in which they have been brought because the underlying claims
    are subject to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of
    1986. Implemented in 1988, the Act established a mandatory,
    federally administered no-fault claims process for individuals
    who allege that they were harmed by the administration of
    childhood vaccines. Under the Act, claims must first be brought
    before the U.S. Court of Claims for an award determination
    under the compensation guidelines established pursuant to the
    Act. Claimants who are unsatisfied with their awards under the
    Act may reject the award and seek traditional judicial remedies.

Other
    Marketing Practices Investigations

In 2002, 2003, and 2004, we received grand jury subpoenas from
    the Office of Consumer Litigation, Department of Justice,
    related to our marketing and promotional practices and physician
    communications with respect to Evista. In the fourth quarter of
    2004 we recorded a provision for $36.0 million in
    connection with the matter. In December 2005, we reached a
    settlement of the matter with the government, which was
    subsequently approved by the U.S. District Court for the
    Southern District of Indiana in February 2006. As part of the
    settlement, we agreed to plead guilty to one misdemeanor
    violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The plea is for
    the off-label promotion of Evista during 1998. The government
    did not charge the company with any unlawful intent, nor do we
    acknowledge any such intent. In connection with the overall
    settlement, we paid a total of $36.0 million. In addition,
    as part of the settlement, a civil consent decree requires us to
    continue to have a compliance program and to undertake a set of
    defined corporate integrity obligations related to Evista for
    five years.

In August 2003, we received notice that the staff of the SEC is
    conducting an investigation into the compliance by Polish
    subsidiaries of certain pharmaceutical companies, including
    Lilly, with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.
    The staff has issued subpoenas to us requesting production of
    documents related to the investigation. We are cooperating with
    the SEC in responding to the investigation.

Other
    Matters

In October 2005, we received a subpoena from the
    U.S. Attorney’s office for the District of
    Massachusetts for the production of documents relating to our
    business relationship with a long-term care pharmacy
    organization concerning Actos, Humalog, Humulin, and Zyprexa. We
    are cooperating in responding to the subpoena.

Between 2003 and 2005, various counties in New York sued us and
    many other pharmaceutical manufacturers, claiming in general
    that as a result of alleged improprieties by the manufacturers
    in the calculation and reporting of average wholesale prices for
    purposes of Medicaid reimbursement, the counties overpaid their
    portion of the cost of pharmaceuticals. The suits seek monetary
    and other relief, including civil penalties and treble damages.
    A similar suit was filed against us and many other manufacturers
    by the state of Mississippi. The suits have been transferred to
    the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts
    for pretrial proceedings and are in the earliest stages

-14-

During 2004 we, along with several other pharmaceutical
    companies, were named in one consolidated case in Minnesota
    federal court brought on behalf of consumers alleging that the
    conduct of pharmaceutical companies in preventing commercial
    importation of prescription drugs from outside the United States
    violated antitrust laws and one case in California state court
    brought by several pharmacies in which plaintiffs’ claims
    are less specifically stated, but are substantially similar to
    the claims asserted in Minnesota. Both cases seek restitution
    for alleged overpayments for pharmaceuticals and an injunction
    against the allegedly violative conduct. The federal district
    court in the Minnesota case has dismissed the federal claims,
    ruling that the state claims must be brought in separate state
    court actions. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has affirmed
    the district court’s decision. In the California case,
    summary judgment has been granted to Lilly and the other
    defendants. The plaintiffs have appealed that decision.

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
    and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, we have been
    designated as one of several potentially responsible parties
    with respect to the cleanup of fewer than 10 sites. Under
    Superfund, each responsible party may be jointly and severally
    liable for the entire amount of the cleanup.

We are also a defendant in other litigation and investigations,
    including product liability and patent suits, of a character we
    regard as normal to our business.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

This section provides an overview of our financial results,
    significant business development, recent product and late-stage
    pipeline developments, and legal and governmental matters
    affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry.

Financial Results

We achieved worldwide sales growth of 7 percent, primarily
    as a result of strong growth of our newer products. We increased
    our investment in marketing expenses in support of key products,
    primarily
    Cymbalta

®

and diabetes care products, and continued our commitment to
    research and development, investing approximately
    20 percent of our sales during 2006. Our results also
    benefited from continued growth in profitability of the Lilly
    ICOS joint venture as well as cost-containment and productivity
    initiatives. Net income was $2.66 billion, or
    $2.45 per share, in 2006 as compared with
    $1.98 billion, or $1.81 per share, in 2005,
    representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of
    35 percent. Net income comparisons between 2006 and 2005
    are affected by the impact of the following significant items
    that are reflected in our financial results (see
    Notes 2, 4, and 13 to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information):


•

We recognized asset impairments, restructuring and other special
    charges of $450.3 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter,
    which decreased earnings per share by $.31 (Note 4).

•

In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge related to
    Zyprexa

®

product liability litigation matters of $494.9 million
    (pretax), or $.42 per share (Notes 4 and 13).


•

We incurred a charge related to product liability litigation
    matters, primarily related to Zyprexa, of $1.07 billion
    (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.90 in the
    second quarter of 2005 (Notes 4 and 13).

•

We recognized asset impairments and other special charges of
    $171.9 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which
    decreased earnings per share by $.14 (Note 4).

•

We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    Interpretation (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 143, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The adoption of
    FIN 47 resulted in an adjustment for the cumulative effect
    of a change in accounting principle of $22.0 million
    (after-tax), which decreased earnings per share by $.02
    (Note 2).

-16-

Business
    Development, and Recent Product and Late-Stage Pipeline
    Developments

Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability
    to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical
    products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in
    development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.
    We have achieved a number of successes with recent product
    launches and late-stage pipeline developments, including:

•

On January 29, 2007, we completed the acquisition of
    ICOS Corporation for approximately $2.3 billion in
    cash. The acquisition brings the full value of
    Cialis

®

to us and enables us to realize operational efficiencies in the
    further development, marketing and selling of this product. The
    allocation of the purchase price has not yet been completed;
    however, we anticipate that the one-time charge to earnings for
    acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) will
    approximate $300 million (no tax benefit) (Note 3).

•

In November 2006, we received European Commission authorization
    to market
    Byetta

®

as a treatment for type 2 diabetes with our partner, Amylin
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin). In addition, in December 2006,
    we received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) for Byetta as an add-on therapy to improve
    blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes who have not
    achieved adequate control on a thiazolidinedione (TZD).

•

We submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for
    Evista

®

for the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in
    postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women
    at high risk for breast cancer.

•

We initiated a Phase III clinical trial to study
    enzastaurin as a maintenance therapy to prevent relapse in
    patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Additionally, we
    closed the enrollment of a Phase III study of enzastaurin
    for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma after an external
    data monitoring committee determined the study would likely not
    meet its primary efficacy endpoint.

-17-

•

In July 2006, we received FDA approval for
    Gemzar

®

for
    the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer in combination with
    carboplatin. Additionally, the United Kingdom’s National
    Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has recommended
    Gemzar coverage under the UK’s National Health Service for
    the use of Gemzar, in combination with paclitaxel, within a
    limited population of breast cancer patients.

•

In September 2006, we received an approvable letter from the FDA
    for
    Arxxant

tm

for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. The FDA has indicated
    that it will require efficacy data from an additional
    Phase III study before it will consider approving the
    molecule. We decided to appeal the FDA’s decision and began
    discussions with the agency. There can be no assurance that our
    appeal will be successful.

•

We submitted a supplemental NDA to the FDA for Cymbalta for the
    treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. We are also
    conducting Phase III studies on Cymbalta for the treatment
    of fibromyalgia, a chronic, often debilitating pain disorder.

•

In January 2007, we licensed from OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
    (OSI), its glucokinase activator (GKA) program for the treatment
    of type 2 diabetes, including the lead compound PSN010. We
    received an exclusive license to develop and market any
    compounds derived from the GKA program. Under the terms of the
    agreement, we paid an upfront fee of $25.0 million (pretax)
    (Note 3).

•

In January 2007, along with our partner, Daiichi Sankyo, we
    announced that we completed enrollment in the TRITON study, a
    Phase III

head-to-head

study comparing prasugrel to clopidogrel
    (Plavix

®

)
    in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous
    coronary intervention (PCI).

Legal and
    Governmental Matters

In December 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
    Circuit affirmed a district court ruling upholding the validity
    of our Zyprexa patent. We are very confident we will maintain
    our U.S. patent protection on Zyprexa until 2011.

We have reached agreements with claimants’ attorneys
    involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to
    settle a total of approximately 28,500 claims against us
    relating to the medication. Approximately 1,300 claims remain.
    As a result of our product liability exposures, the substantial
    majority of which were related to

-18-

Zyprexa, we recorded net pretax charges of $1.07 billion in
    the second quarter of 2005 and $494.9 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2006.

In March 2004, we were notified by the U.S. Attorney’s
    office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that it had
    commenced a civil investigation relating to our
    U.S. marketing and promotional practices.

In the United States, implementation of the Medicare
    Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003
    (MMA), which provides a prescription drug benefit under the
    Medicare program, took effect January 1, 2006. In 2006, we
    experienced a one-time sales benefit as a result of MMA;
    however, in the long term there is additional risk of increased
    pricing pressures. While the MMA prohibits the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services (HHS) from directly negotiating
    prescription drug prices with manufacturers, legislation was
    passed in early 2007 by the U.S. House of Representatives
    that would require HHS to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical
    manufacturers. This legislation will be considered by the
    U.S. Senate. MMA retains the authority of the Secretary of
    HHS to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs.
    Legislation to allow for broad-scale importation has been
    presented to both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
    The proposed legislation could remove that authority and allow
    for the importation of products into the U.S. If adopted,
    such legislation would likely have a negative effect on our
    U.S. sales. Current importation language allows for
    medication to be carried in person from Canada to the U.S. and
    does not authorize mail or Internet importation. Further, the
    language disallows certain medications including injectibles. We
    believe the expanded prescription drug coverage for seniors
    under the MMA has further alleviated the perceived need for a
    federal importation scheme. However, notwithstanding the federal
    law that continues to prohibit all but the very narrow drug
    importation detailed above, several states have implemented
    importation schemes for their citizens, usually involving a
    website that links patients to selected Canadian pharmacies.

The successful implementation of the MMA may relieve some state
    budget pressures but is unlikely to result in reduced pricing
    pressures at the state level. A majority of states have
    implemented supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in
    their Medicaid programs, and these programs are expected to
    continue in the

post-MMA

environment. Moreover, under the 2005 federal Deficit Reduction
    Act, states will have greater flexibility to impose new
    cost-sharing requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries for
    non-preferred prescription drugs that will result in certain
    beneficiaries bearing more of the cost. Several states also are
    attempting to extend discounted Medicaid prices to non-Medicaid
    patients. As a result, we expect pressures on pharmaceutical
    pricing to continue.

As it relates to the Medicare program, Lilly has implemented the
    LillyMedicareAnswers program. Lilly- MedicareAnswers is a new
    patient assistance program that provides certain eligible
    Medicare Part D enrolled patients access to a one
    month’s-supply of select medications for a $25
    administrative fee per prescription. Medications available via
    the program include Zyprexa,
    Forteo

®

,
    and
    Humatrope

®

.

International operations also are generally subject to extensive
    price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for
    additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that
    would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or
    reduce the value of our intellectual property protection.

OPERATING
    RESULTS — 2006

Sales

Our worldwide sales for 2006 increased 7 percent, to
    $15.69 billion, driven primarily by sales growth of
    Cymbalta, Forteo, Byetta, Zyprexa, and
    Alimta

®

.
    Worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent and selling
    prices increased sales by 4 percent. Foreign exchange rates
    did not impact our overall sales growth. Sales in the
    U.S. increased 10 percent, to $8.60 billion,
    driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, diabetes care
    products, Forteo, and Zyprexa. U.S. growth comparisons
    benefited from an estimated $170 million of wholesaler
    destocking that had occurred in 2005 as a result of
    restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in
    the first quarter of 2005. Additionally, we experienced a
    one-time sales benefit resulting from a shift of certain
    low-income patients from Medicaid to Medicare and increased
    access to medical coverage by certain patients previously
    covered under our LillyAnswers program following the
    implementation

-19-

of MMA in 2006. This contributed part of the increases in
    U.S. net effective sales prices of 9 percent. Sales
    outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, to
    $7.09 billion, driven by growth of Cymbalta, Alimta, and
    Zyprexa.

Zyprexa, our top-selling product, is a treatment for
    schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa
    sales in the U.S. increased 4 percent in 2006, driven
    by higher prices, offset in part by lower demand. The increase
    in net effective selling prices was partially due to the
    transition of certain low-income patients from Medicaid to
    Medicare. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent,
    driven primarily by increased demand, offset in part by
    declining prices.

    compared with 2005. The sales shown in the table above represent
    results only in the territories in which we market Cialis
    exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint-venture
    territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto

Diabetes care products, composed primarily of Humalog, our
    insulin analog; Humulin, a biosynthetic human insulin; Actos, an
    oral agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; and Byetta, the
    first in a new class of medicines known as incretin mimetics for
    type 2 diabetes that we market with Amylin, had aggregate
    worldwide revenues of $2.96 billion in 2006, an increase of
    6 percent. Diabetes care revenues in the
    U.S. increased 8 percent, to $1.73 billion.
    Diabetes care revenues outside the U.S. increased
    2 percent, to $1.23 billion. Results from our primary
    diabetes care products are as follows:

•

Humalog sales increased 10 percent in the U.S., due
    primarily to higher prices and increased 7 percent outside
    the U.S., due primarily to increased volume, offset partially by
    lower prices.

•

Humulin sales in the U.S. decreased 10 percent due
    primarily to decreased volume, offset partially by increased
    selling prices. Outside the U.S., Humulin sales decreased
    6 percent due to decreases in demand and selling prices.

•

Actos revenues in the U.S., the majority of which represent
    service revenues from a copromotion agreement in the
    U.S. with Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America (Takeda),
    decreased 22 percent in 2006. Actos is manufactured by
    Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., and sold in the U.S. by
    Takeda. Our U.S. marketing rights with respect to Actos
    expired in September 2006; however, we will continue receiving
    royalties from Takeda. As a result, our revenues from Actos will
    decline each year through September 2009. Our arrangement
    outside the U.S. continues. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 23 percent, due primarily to increased
    volume in addition to a favorable impact of foreign exchange
    rates, offset in part by lower prices.

•

Sales of Byetta, launched in the U.S. in June 2005, were
    $430.2 million for 2006. We report as revenue our
    50 percent share of Byetta’s gross margin and our
    sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin.

Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to fight various cancers,
    increased 4 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher
    prices as well as the reductions in U.S. wholesaler
    inventory levels in 2005. Gemzar sales increased 7 percent
    outside the U.S., driven by strong volume.

Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major
    depressive disorder and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain,
    increased 82 percent in the U.S., due to strong demand.
    Sales of Cymbalta outside the U.S. reflect international
    launches. Worldwide sales exceeded $1 billion in 2006, the
    product’s second full year on the market.

-21-

Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of
    osteoporosis, increased 2 percent in the U.S. due to
    higher prices, offset partially by a decline in demand. Outside
    the U.S., sales of Evista decreased 1 percent, driven by
    lower prices, offset by an increase in demand.

Sales of Alimta, a treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma
    and second-line treatment for non-smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC),
    increased 18 percent and 57 percent in the U.S. and
    outside the U.S., respectively, due primarily to increased
    demand.

Sales of Forteo, a treatment for severe osteoporosis, increased
    57 percent in the U.S. In addition to increased
    demand, U.S. sales significantly benefited from
    patients’ access to medical coverage through the Medicare
    Part D program and from decreased utilization of our
    U.S. patient assistance program, LillyAnswers. Sales
    outside the U.S. increased 43 percent, reflecting a
    strong demand.

Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit
    hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults,
    increased 2 percent in the U.S. due to higher prices
    as well as the reductions in U.S. wholesaler inventory
    levels in 2005, offset by a decline in demand. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 31 percent due primarily to increased
    demand in addition to a modest favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates, offset partially by lower prices.

Total product sales of Cialis, an erectile dysfunction
    treatment, increased 38 percent in the U.S. and
    24 percent outside the U.S. Worldwide Cialis sales
    growth reflects the impact of market share gains, market growth,
    and price increases during 2006. Cialis sales in our territories
    are reported in net sales, while our 50 percent share of
    the joint-venture net income is reported in other
    income — net. All sales of Cialis subsequent to the
    ICOS acquisition in 2007 will be included in our revenue.

Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased
    10 percent, due primarily to increased demand led by
    Rumensin

®

and
    Tylan

®

.
    Sales outside the U.S. decreased 5 percent, driven
    primarily by the decrease in the sales of
    Surmax

®

as a result of the European Union’s growth promotion use
    ban on the product, effective January 1, 2006.

Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses

The 2006 gross margin increased to 77.4 percent of sales
    compared with 76.3 percent for 2005. This increase was
    primarily due to increased product prices and increased
    production volume, partially offset by higher manufacturing
    expenses.

-22-

Operating expenses (the aggregate of research and development
    and marketing and administrative expenses) increased
    7 percent in 2006. Investment in research and development
    increased 3 percent, to $3.13 billion, primarily due
    to increases in discovery research and clinical trial costs. We
    continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing
    approximately 20 percent of our sales into research and
    development during 2006. Marketing and administrative expenses
    increased 9 percent in 2006, to $4.89 billion. This
    increase was largely attributable to increased marketing
    expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the
    diabetes care franchise, and an increase in litigation-related
    costs.

Other income — net decreased $76.4 million, to
    $237.8 million, and consists of interest expense, interest
    income, the after-tax operating results of the Lilly ICOS joint
    venture, and all other miscellaneous income and expense items.

•

Interest expense for 2006 increased $132.9 million, to
    $238.1 million. This increase is a result of higher
    interest rates and less capitalized interest due to the
    completion in late 2005 of certain manufacturing facilities.

•

Interest income for 2006 increased $49.8 million, to
    $261.9 million, due to higher short-term interest rates.

•

The Lilly ICOS joint-venture income was $96.3 million in
    2006 as compared to $11.1 million in 2005. The increase was
    due to increased Cialis sales and decreased selling and
    marketing expenses.

•

Net other miscellaneous income items decreased
    $78.5 million to $117.7 million, primarily as a result
    of less income related to the outlicensing of legacy products
    and partnered compounds in development.

We incurred tax expense of $755.3 million in 2006,
    resulting in an effective tax rate of 22.1 percent,
    compared with 26.3 percent for 2005. The effective tax
    rates for 2006 and 2005 were affected primarily by the product
    liability charges of $494.9 million and $1.07 billion,
    respectively. The tax expense of these charges was less than our
    effective tax rate, as the tax expense was calculated based upon
    existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect
    to deduct the charge. See Note 10 to the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information.

OPERATING
    RESULTS — 2005

Financial Results

We achieved worldwide sales growth of 6 percent, due in
    part to the launch in 2004 of five new products as well as six
    new indications or formulations for expanded use of new and
    existing products in key markets. In addition, we launched one
    new product in the U.S. and several new products, new
    indications, or new formulations in key markets in 2005. We
    continued our substantial investments in our manufacturing
    operations and research and development activities, resulting in
    cost of products sold and research and development costs
    increasing at rates greater than sales. Despite product launch
    expenditures, our cost-containment and productivity measures
    contributed to marketing and administrative expenses increasing
    at a rate less than sales. During 2005, we began to expense
    stock options, which had the effect of increasing our research
    and development and marketing and administrative expenses. We
    also benefited from an increase in other income — net,
    due primarily to increased profitability of the Lilly ICOS joint
    venture, and a decrease in the tax rate in 2005. Net income was
    $1.98 billion, or $1.81 per share, in 2005 as compared
    with $1.81 billion, or $1.66 per share, in 2004,
    representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of
    9 percent. Certain items, reflected in our operating
    results for 2005 and 2004, should be considered in comparing the
    two years. The significant items for 2005 are summarized in the
    Executive Overview. The 2004 items are summarized as follows
    (see Notes 1, 3, 4, 7, and 10 to the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information):

•

In 2005, we began to expense stock options in accordance with
    SFAS 123(R). Had we expensed stock options in 2004, our
    2004 net income would have been lower by
    $266.4 million, which would have decreased earnings per
    share by $.24 per share (Notes 1 and 7).

•

We recognized asset impairment charges, streamlined our
    infrastructure, and provided for the anticipated resolution of
    the government investigation of Evista marketing and promotional
    practices, resulting in charges of $108.9 million (pretax)
    in the second quarter of 2004 and $494.1 million (pretax)
    in the fourth quarter of 2004, which decreased earnings per
    share by $.08 and $.30, respectively (Note 4).

•

We incurred charges for acquired in-process research and
    development (IPR&D) of $362.3 million (no tax benefit)
    in the first quarter of 2004 related to the acquisition of
    Applied Molecular Evolution, Inc. (AME), and $29.9 million
    (pretax) in the fourth quarter of 2004 related to our
    acquisition of a Phase I compound under development as a
    potential treatment for insomnia, which decreased earnings per
    share by $.33 in the first quarter of 2004 and $.02 in the
    fourth quarter of 2004 (Note 3).

•

We recognized tax expenses of $465.0 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2004 associated with the anticipated repatriation in
    2005 of $8.00 billion of our earnings reinvested outside
    the U.S., as a result of the passage of the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). This tax expense decreased earnings
    per share by $.43 in that quarter (Note 10).

Sales

Our worldwide sales for 2005 increased 6 percent, to
    $14.65 billion, driven primarily by sales growth of
    Cymbalta, Alimta, Forteo, and Gemzar. As a result of
    restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in
    early 2005, reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels
    for certain products (primarily Strattera,
    Prozac

®

,
    and Gemzar) that reduced our sales by approximately
    $170 million. Sales growth in 2005 was also affected by
    decreased U.S. demand for Zyprexa, Strattera, and Prozac.
    Despite this wholesaler destocking and decreased demand, sales
    in the U.S. increased 2 percent, to
    $7.80 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of
    Cymbalta and Alimta. Sales outside the U.S. increased
    11 percent, to $6.85 billion, driven by growth of
    Zyprexa, Alimta, and Gemzar. Worldwide sales reflected a volume
    increase of 3 percent, with global selling prices
    contributing 1 percent and an increase due to favorable
    changes in exchange rates contributing 1 percent. (Numbers
    do not add due to rounding.)

U.S. sales include sales in
    Puerto Rico.


Cialis had worldwide 2005 sales of
    $746.6 million, representing an increase of 35 percent
    compared with 2004. The sales shown in the table above represent
    results only in the territories in which we market Cialis
    exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint-venture
    territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto
    Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint-venture territory
    sales, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other
    income — net in our consolidated statements of income.

Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 16 percent in
    2005, resulting from a decline in underlying demand due to
    continuing competitive pressures. Sales outside the U.S. in
    2005 increased 9 percent, driven by volume growth in a
    number of major markets and the favorable impact of exchange
    rates. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, sales of Zyprexa
    outside the U.S. increased by 6 percent.

Diabetes care products had aggregate worldwide revenues of
    $2.80 billion in 2005, an increase of 7 percent.
    Diabetes care revenues in the U.S. increased
    7 percent, to $1.59 billion, primarily driven by
    higher prices, offset partially by a decline in underlying
    demand due to continued competitive pressures in the insulins
    market and reductions in wholesaler inventory levels of
    insulins. Diabetes care revenues outside the U.S. increased
    8 percent, to $1.20 billion. Humalog sales increased
    8 percent in the U.S. and 10 percent outside the
    U.S. Humulin sales in the U.S. decreased
    3 percent, while Humulin sales outside the
    U.S. increased 3 percent. Actos revenues increased
    9 percent in 2005. Sales of Byetta were $74.6 million
    following its June 2005 launch. Our reported net sales of Byetta
    totaled $39.6 million in 2005.

Sales of Gemzar increased 4 percent in the U.S. in
    2005 and were negatively affected by reductions in wholesaler
    inventory levels as a result of our restructured arrangements
    with our U.S. wholesalers. Gemzar sales increased
    15 percent outside the U.S., driven by strong volume growth
    in a number of cancer indications.

Sales of Evista decreased 2 percent in the U.S. due to
    declines in U.S. underlying demand resulting from continued
    competitive pressures and to reductions in wholesaler inventory
    levels. This decline was partially

-25-

offset by price increases. Outside the U.S., sales of Evista
    increased 11 percent, driven by volume growth in several
    markets and the early 2004 launch of the product in Japan.

Cymbalta was launched in the U.S. in late August 2004 for
    the treatment of major depressive disorder and in September 2004
    for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain.
    Cymbalta launches began in Europe for the treatment of major
    depressive disorder during the first quarter of 2005. Cymbalta
    generated $679.7 million in sales in 2005.

Sales of Strattera declined 24 percent in the U.S. in
    2005 due to wholesaler destocking resulting from restructured
    arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers and a decline in
    underlying demand. Sales outside the U.S. were
    $53.4 million in 2005, compared with $10.3 million in
    2004, primarily reflecting launches in Australia, Canada,
    Germany, Mexico, and Spain.

Alimta was launched in the U.S. in February 2004 for the
    treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma and in August for
    second-line treatment of non-smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC).
    Alimta was launched in several European countries in the second
    half of 2004 and throughout 2005. Alimta generated sales of
    $463.2 million in 2005.

Forteo increased 34 percent in the U.S. in 2005,
    driven by strong growth in underlying demand. Sales growth was
    offset, in part, by wholesaler destocking in the first half of
    2005 related to our revised arrangements with
    U.S. wholesalers.

Cialis worldwide sales of $746.6 million in 2005 reflected
    an increase of 35 percent compared to 2004, and comprises
    $169.9 million of sales in our territories, and
    $576.7 million of sales in the joint-venture territories.
    Within the joint-venture territories, U.S. sales of Cialis
    were $272.9 million for 2005, an increase of
    32 percent, despite wholesaler destocking in the first half
    of the year as a result of our restructured arrangements with
    our U.S. wholesalers.

Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased
    9 percent, while sales outside the U.S. increased

Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses

The 2005 gross margin decreased to 76.3 percent of sales
    compared with 76.7 percent for 2004. The decrease was
    primarily due to higher manufacturing expenses, partially offset
    by favorable product mix and lower factory inventory losses.

Operating expenses increased 8 percent in 2005. Investment
    in research and development increased 12 percent, to
    $3.03 billion, in 2005, due to the adoption of stock option
    expensing in 2005, decreased reimbursements from collaboration
    partners, and increased incentive compensation and benefits
    expenses. We continued to be a leader in our industry peer group
    by investing approximately 21 percent of our sales into
    research and development during 2005. Marketing and
    administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2005, to
    $4.50 billion, due to the adoption of stock option
    expensing in 2005, and increased incentive compensation and
    benefits expenses. This comparison also benefited from a
    charitable contribution to the Lilly Foundation during the
    fourth quarter of 2004. Research and development expenses would
    have increased by 8 percent, and marketing and
    administrative expenses would have been flat for 2005, if 2004
    had been restated as if stock options had been expensed.

Other income — net increased $35.8 million in
    2005, to $314.2 million, due to the following:

•

Interest expense for 2005 increased $53.6 million, to
    $105.2 million, primarily due to increased interest rates.

•

Interest income for 2005 increased $55.4 million, to
    $212.1 million, due to increased investment balances and
    interest rates.

-26-

•

Our net income from the Lilly ICOS joint venture was
    $11.1 million for 2005, compared with a net loss of
    $79.0 million in 2004. The joint venture became profitable
    for the first time in the third quarter of 2005.

•

Net other miscellaneous income items decreased
    $56.1 million to $196.2 million, primarily as a result
    of less income related to the outlicense of legacy products and
    partnered products in development.

The effective tax rate for 2005 was 26.3 percent, compared
    with 38.5 percent for 2004. The effective tax rate for 2005
    was affected by the product liability charge of
    $1.07 billion. The tax benefit of this charge was less than
    our effective tax rate, as the tax benefit was calculated based
    upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably
    expect to deduct the charge. The effective tax rate for 2004 was
    affected by the tax provision related to the expected
    repatriation of $8.00 billion of earnings reinvested
    outside the U.S. pursuant to the AJCA and the charge for
    acquired IPR&D related to the AME acquisition, which is not
    deductible for tax purposes. See Note 10 to the
    consolidated financial statements for additional information.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

As of December 31, 2006, cash, cash equivalents, and
    short-term investments totaled $3.89 billion compared with
    $5.04 billion at December 31, 2005. Strong cash flow
    from operations in 2006 of $3.98 billion was more than
    offset by repayments of long-term debt of $2.78 billion,
    dividends paid of $1.74 billion, and capital expenditures
    of $1.08 billion.

Capital expenditures of $1.08 billion during 2006 were
    $220.3 million less than in 2005, due primarily to the
    management of capital spending and completion of key projects.
    We expect near-term capital expenditures to remain approximately
    the same as 2006 levels while we invest in our biotech and
    research and development initiatives, continue to upgrade our
    manufacturing facilities to enhance productivity and quality
    systems, and invest in the long-term growth of our diabetes care
    products.

Total debt as of December 31, 2006 was $3.71 billion,
    reflecting a net repayment of $2.78 billion during 2006. In
    early 2007, we issued approximately $2.5 billion of debt to
    finance our acquisition of ICOS, including the acquisition of
    ICOS stock and refinancing of ICOS debt. Our current debt
    ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s
    remain at AA and Aa3, respectively.

Dividends of $1.60 per share were paid in 2006, an increase
    of 5 percent from 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006,
    effective for the first-quarter dividend in 2007, the quarterly
    dividend was increased to $.425 per share (a 6 percent
    increase), resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2007 of
    $1.70 per share. The year 2006 was the
    122nd consecutive year in which we made dividend payments
    and the 39th consecutive year in which dividends have been
    increased.

-27-

We believe that cash generated from operations, along with
    available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund
    our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital
    expenditures, costs associated with product liability
    litigation, dividends, and taxes in 2007. We believe that
    amounts available through our existing commercial paper program
    should be adequate to fund maturities of short-term borrowings,
    if necessary. We currently have $1.21 billion of unused
    committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which
    backs our commercial paper program. Excluding the longterm debt
    issued for the ICOS acquisition, we plan to use available cash
    to repay approximately $1 billion of debt outside the
    U.S. by the end of 2007. Various risks and uncertainties,
    including those discussed in the Financial Expectations for 2007
    section, may affect our operating results and cash generated
    from operations.

-28-

In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to
    fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These
    fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and
    operating. We address a portion of these risks through a
    controlled program of risk management that includes the use of
    derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling
    these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations
    in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative
    activities are for purposes other than trading.

Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in
    short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to
    manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an
    acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt
    positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help
    maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate
    exposure at December 31, 2006 and 2005, including
    derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments,
    a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied
    to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, would have no material impact on
    earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate
    risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.

Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating
    currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against
    the euro and the Japanese yen. We face transactional currency
    exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally
    on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than
    the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises
    from translating the results of our global operations to the
    U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the
    beginning of the period. We use forward contracts and purchased
    options to manage our foreign currency exposures. Our policy
    outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such
    exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions
    offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the
    existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated
    revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments
    outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005, a hypothetical
    10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the
    U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash
    flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk-sensitive
    instruments over a one-year period. These calculations do not
    reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the
    underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the
    results of the derivative instruments.

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material
    current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material
    future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
    condition, revenues or expenses,

-29-

results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or
    capital resources. We acquire assets still in development and
    enter into research and development arrangements with third
    parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the
    third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future
    events linked to the success of the asset in development.
    Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the
    successful achievement of an important point in the development
    life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the
    product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency). If
    required by the arrangement, we may have to make royalty
    payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the
    pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for
    marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these
    payments, they are not included in the table of contractual
    obligations.

Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will
    require future cash payments are as follows (in millions):

Our long-term debt obligations
    include both our expected principal and interest obligations and
    our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve
    at December 31, 2006 to compute the amount of the
    contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt
    instruments and swaps.


We have included the following:

•

Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase
    orders at our significant operating locations as of
    December 31, 2006. Some of these purchase orders may be
    cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have
    not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase
    obligations.

•

Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant
    vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent.


We have included our long-term
    liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified
    supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred
    compensation liabilities.


This category comprises primarily
    minimum pension funding requirements.

Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one
    reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products
    covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the
    same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be
    material to the results of operations in any one period. The
    inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely
    that this will occur, as the failure rate for products in
    development is very high. In addition, these arrangements often
    give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of
    the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent
    payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the
    compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives. We
    also note that, from a business perspective, we view these
    payments as positive because they signify that the product is
    successfully moving through development and is now generating or
    is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.
    The contractual obligations table is current as of
    December 31, 2006. The amount of these obligations can be
    expected to change materially over time as new contracts are
    initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or
    modified.

APPLICATION
    OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In preparing our financial statements in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets, liabilities, revenues,

-30-

expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can
    be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could
    differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate
    or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying
    reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could
    develop different estimates. We believe that, given current
    facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such
    other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect
    on our consolidated results of operations, financial position,
    or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most
    critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit
    committee and are described below.

Revenue
    Recognition and Sales Rebate and Discount Accruals

We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of
    goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and
    rewards of ownership. For more than 90 percent of our
    sales, this is at the time products are shipped to the customer,
    typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. The
    remaining sales are recorded at the point of delivery.
    Provisions for discounts and rebates are established in the same
    period the related sales are recorded.

We regularly review the supply levels of our significant
    products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major
    markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic
    inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and
    available prescription volume information for our products, or
    alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler
    inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or
    less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes
    of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or
    anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated
    changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday
    stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. An
    unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our
    products outside the U.S. could also be the result of
    speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price
    increases. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have
    caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major
    product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our
    product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be
    material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always
    able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking.

As a result of restructuring our arrangements with our
    U.S. wholesalers in early 2005, reductions occurred in
    wholesaler inventory levels for certain products (primarily
    Strattera, Prozac, and Gemzar) that reduced our 2005 sales by
    approximately $170 million. The modified structure
    eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and
    provides us improved data on inventory levels at our
    U.S. wholesalers. Wholesaler stocking and destocking
    activity historically has not caused any material changes in the
    rate of actual product returns, which have been approximately
    1 percent of our net sales over the past three years and
    have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales.

We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same
    period as the related sales. The rebate/discount amounts are
    recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales. Sales
    rebates/discounts that require the use of judgment in the
    establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care,
    Medicare, chargebacks,

long-term

care, hospital, discount card programs, and various other
    government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our
    historical rebate/discount payments made to our customer segment
    groups and the provisions of current rebate/discount contracts.
    We calculate these rebates/discounts based upon a percentage of
    our sales for each of our products as defined by the statutory
    rates and the contracts with our various customer groups.

The largest of our sales rebate/discount amounts are rebates
    associated with sales covered by Medicaid. Although we accrue a
    liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale
    (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to
    that sale is typically billed up to six months later. Due to the
    time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may
    incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. In
    determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our
    historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage
    of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in
    sales trends, an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws
    and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are
    sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current
    rebate/discount contracts.

-31-

Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or
    legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the
    same period as the related sales. In some large European
    countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated
    pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of
    these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise
    budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the
    related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual
    pharmaceutical budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves.

We believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are
    reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and
    circumstances. Federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state
    pharmaceutical assistance programs (Medicaid) and Medicare
    rebates reduced sales by $571.7 million,
    $637.1 million, and $641.0 million in 2006, 2005, and
    2004, respectively. A 5 percent change in the Medicaid and
    Medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2006 would lead to an
    approximate $29 million effect on our income before income
    taxes. As of December 31, 2006, our Medicaid and Medicare
    rebate liability was $259.0 million.

Approximately 85 percent and 90 percent of our global
    rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our
    products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The following represents a roll-forward of our
    most significant U.S. rebate and discount liability
    balances, including Medicaid (in millions):

Product
    Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies

Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by
    their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and
    probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product
    litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability
    amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation,
    the nature and the number of other similar current and past
    litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current
    assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the
    likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement
    discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product
    liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can
    formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate
    these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience
    and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs
    expected to be incurred in connection with significant product
    liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable.

We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the
    exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our
    insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and
    exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the
    insurance company, the financial position of the insurers, and
    the possibility of and the length of time for collection.

The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the
    related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on
    a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our
    consolidated balance sheets.

We believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we
    have established for product litigation liabilities and other
    contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and
    circumstances.

Pension
    and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions

Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate,
    retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree
    medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate,
    retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and
    health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a
    significant effect on the amounts

-32-

reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 12 to
    the consolidated financial statements for additional information
    regarding our retirement benefits.

Periodically, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected
    return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree
    health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we
    consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount
    rates, expected return on plan assets and the health-care-cost
    trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions
    compared with actual results; an analysis of current market
    conditions and asset allocations (approximately 85 percent
    to 95 percent of which are growth investments); and the
    views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an
    actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve to
    determine the discount rate. In evaluating our expected
    retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of
    our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits
    together with our expectations of future retirement ages.

We believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are
    appropriate based upon the above factors. If the
    health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one
    percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service
    cost and interest cost components of the 2006 annual expense
    would increase by approximately $28 million. A
    one-percentage-point decrease would decrease the aggregate of
    the 2006 service cost and interest cost by approximately
    $24 million. If the discount rate for 2006 were to be
    changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income
    taxes would change by approximately $28 million. If the
    expected return on plan assets for 2006 were to be changed by a
    quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would
    change by approximately $14 million. If our assumption
    regarding the expected age of future retirees for 2006 were
    adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be
    affected by approximately $29 million.

Impairment
    of Long-lived Assets

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential
    impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be
    recoverable. Impairment is determined by comparing projected
    undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its
    carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is
    recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value
    over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. The
    estimated future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable
    assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment.
    Actual results could vary from these estimates.

Income
    Taxes

We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of
    tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these
    judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business,
    our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing
    authorities, which may result in future tax and interest
    assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist
    in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law
    resulting from legislation, regulation

and/or

as
    concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court
    systems. We record a liability for tax contingencies when we
    believe it is probable that we will be assessed and the amount
    of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. The tax
    contingency reserve is adjusted for changes in facts and
    circumstances and additional uncertainties. For example,
    adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing
    tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by
    the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax
    examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe that
    our estimates for tax contingency reserves are appropriate and
    sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations
    of our tax returns.

We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our
    deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated
    from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions. In
    evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these
    deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable
    income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions
    associated with these carry forwards where history does not
    support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning
    strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future

-33-

income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the
    reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income
    tax expense.

We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances
    against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current
    facts and circumstances. A 5 percent change in the
    valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of
    approximately $25 million.

FINANCIAL
    EXPECTATIONS FOR 2007

For the full year of 2007, we expect earnings per share to be in
    the range of $2.89 to $2.99. This guidance includes the
    estimated $.10 per share dilutive impact of the ICOS
    acquisition related to the incremental interest expense on debt
    used to finance the acquisition, the amortization of ICOS
    intangibles and other integration costs. A disproportionate
    amount of this dilution is expected to be incurred in the first
    half of the year. This guidance also includes the IPR&D
    charges related to the ICOS acquisition and the in-licensing of
    a diabetes compound from OSI, together estimated to be a total
    of $.29 per share as discussed in Note 3, as well as
    additional restructuring and other special charges as discussed
    in Note 4, estimated to be $.07 per share. We expect
    sales to grow in the high single or low double digits, impacted
    favorably by the inclusion of all Cialis revenue subsequent to
    the acquisition. Gross margins as a percent of sales are
    expected to improve slightly compared with 2006. In addition, we
    expect operating expenses to grow in the low double digits,
    driven primarily by the inclusion of all Cialis operating
    expenses subsequent to the acquisition and increased marketing
    and selling expenses in support of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, and the
    diabetes care franchise, as well as ongoing investment in
    research and development that will continue to place Lilly among
    the industry leaders in terms of research and development as a
    percent of sales. We also expect other income — net to
    contribute less than $100 million, a reduction from 2006
    due to the removal of the Lilly ICOS joint venture after-tax
    profit. Other income will primarily include net interest income
    and income from the partnering and out-licensing of molecules.
    In terms of cash flow, we expect a continuation of strong cash
    flow trends in 2007, with capital expenditures of approximately
    $1.1 billion.

Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among
    other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed
    products; developments with competitive products; the timing and
    scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product
    launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of
    compounds under development resulting in acquired in-process
    research and development charges; foreign exchange rates;
    wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments,
    litigation and government investigations; and the impact of
    governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and
    reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. We undertake no duty to
    update these forward-looking statements.

LEGAL AND
    REGULATORY MATTERS

We are a party to various legal actions and government
    investigations. The most significant of these are described
    below. While it is not possible to predict or determine the
    outcome of these matters, we believe that, except as
    specifically noted below, the resolution of all such matters
    will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
    financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material
    to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting
    period.

Patent
    Litigation

We are engaged in the following patent litigation matters
    brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch-Waxman Act
    (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of
    1984):

•

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (Reddy), Teva
    Pharmaceuticals, and Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
    which was subsequently acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals
    (together, Teva), each submitted Abbreviated New Drug
    Applications (ANDAs) seeking permission to market generic
    versions of Zyprexa prior to the expiration of our relevant
    U.S. patent (expiring in 2011) and alleging that this
    patent was invalid or not enforceable. We filed lawsuits against
    these companies in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that the patent is valid,
    enforceable and being infringed. The district court ruled in our
    favor on all counts on April 14, 2005, and on
    December 26, 2006, that ruling was upheld by the Court

-34-

of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Reddy and Teva are seeking a
    review of that decision. We are confident Reddy’s and
    Teva’s claims are without merit and we expect to prevail.
    An unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse impact on
    our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial
    position.

•

Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr), submitted an ANDA in 2002
    seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista prior
    to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (expiring in

2012-2017)

and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or
    not infringed. In November 2002, we filed a lawsuit against Barr
    in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
    Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid,
    enforceable, and being infringed by Barr. Teva has also
    submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a generic version
    of Evista. In June 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana,
    seeking a ruling that our relevant U.S. patents are valid,
    enforceable, and being infringed by Teva. No trial date has been
    set in either case. We believe Barr’s and Teva’s
    claims are without merit and we expect to prevail. However, it
    is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this
    litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we
    will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
    liquidity, and financial position.

•

Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sicor), a subsidiary of Teva,
    submitted ANDAs in November 2005 seeking permission to market
    generic versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our
    relevant U.S. patents (expiring in 2010 and 2013), and
    alleging that these patents are invalid. In February 2006, we
    filed a lawsuit against Sicor in the U.S. District Court
    for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that
    these patents are valid and are being infringed by Sicor. In
    response to our lawsuit, Sicor filed a declaratory judgment
    action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District
    of California. Sicor also moved to dismiss our lawsuit in
    Indiana, asserting the Indiana court lacks jurisdiction. The
    California action has been dismissed. In September 2006, we
    received notice that Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc. (Mayne) filed a
    similar ANDA for Gemzar. In October 2006, we filed a lawsuit
    against Mayne in the Southern District of Indiana in response to
    the ANDA filing. In response to our lawsuit, Mayne filed a
    motion to our lawsuit, asserting the Indiana court lacks
    jurisdiction. In October 2006, we received notice that Sun
    Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) filed an ANDA for Gemzar,
    alleging that the 2013 patent is invalid. In December 2006, we
    filed a lawsuit against Sun in the Southern District of Indiana
    in response to Sun’s ANDA filing. We expect to prevail in
    litigation involving our Gemzar patents and believe that claims
    made by these generic companies that our patents are not valid
    are without merit. However, it is not possible to predict or
    determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we
    can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable
    outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
    results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.

In June 2002, we were sued by Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Whitehead Institute
    for Biomedical Research and the President and Fellows of Harvard
    College in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts alleging that sales of two of our products, Xigris
    and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related
    to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the
    human body, and seeking royalties on past and future sales of
    these products. In June 2005, the United States Patent and
    Trademark Office commenced a re-examination of the patent in
    order to consider certain issues raised by us relating to the
    validity of the patent. On May 4, 2006, a jury in Boston
    issued an initial decision in the case that Xigris and Evista
    sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the plaintiffs
    approximately $65 million in damages, calculated by
    applying a 2.3 percent royalty to all U.S. sales of
    Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent
    through the date of trial. We are seeking to have the jury
    verdict overturned by the trial court judge, and if
    unsuccessful, will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals
    for the Federal Circuit. In addition, a separate bench trial
    with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts was held the
    week of August 7, 2006, on our contention that the patent
    is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes. No
    decision has been rendered. We believe that these allegations
    are without legal merit, that we will ultimately prevail on
    these issues and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary
    damages is remote.

Government
    Investigations

In March 2004, the office of the U.S. Attorney for the
    Eastern District of Pennsylvania advised us that it had
    commenced a civil investigation related to our
    U.S. marketing and promotional practices, including our
    communications with physicians and remuneration of physician
    consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and
    Prozac
    Weekly

tm

.

In
    October 2005, the U.S. Attorney’s Office advised that
    it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate
    agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager
    covering
    Axid

®

,
    Evista, Humalog, Humulin, Prozac, and Zyprexa. The inquiry
    includes a review of Lilly’s Medicaid best price reporting
    related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements.
    We are cooperating with the U.S. Attorney in these
    investigations, including providing a broad range of documents
    and information relating to the investigations. In June 2005, we
    received a subpoena from the office of the Attorney General,
    Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, of the State of Florida, seeking
    production of documents relating to sales of Zyprexa and our
    marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. In
    September 2006, we received a subpoena from the California
    Attorney General’s office seeking production of documents
    related to our efforts to obtain and maintain Zyprexa’s
    status on California’s formulary, marketing and promotional
    practices with respect to Zyprexa, and remuneration of health
    care providers. Beginning in August 2006, we have received civil
    investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of
    a number of states. Most of these requests are now part of a
    multistate investigative effort being coordinated by an
    executive committee of attorneys general. We are aware that
    26 states are participating in this joint effort, and we
    anticipate that additional states will join the investigation.
    These attorneys general are seeking a broad range of Zyprexa
    documents, including documents relating to sales, marketing and
    promotional practices, and remuneration of health care
    providers. It is possible that other Lilly products could become
    subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters
    could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other
    monetary or nonmonetary remedies. We cannot predict or determine
    the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount
    or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result
    from an adverse outcome. It is possible, however, that an
    adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial
    position. We have implemented and continue to review and enhance
    a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive
    compliance-related activities designed to ensure that our
    marketing and promotional practices, physician communications,
    remuneration of health care professionals, managed care
    arrangements, and Medicaid best price reporting comply with
    applicable laws and regulations.

Product
    Liability and Related Litigation

We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa
    product liability lawsuits in the United States and have been
    notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed
    suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the
    “claims”) allege a variety of injuries from the use of
    Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or
    contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims
    seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically
    accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side
    effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we
    improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits
    are part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding
    before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District
    Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596).

Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various
    claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product
    liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the
    claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 28,500
    claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits
    and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as
    follows:

•

In June 2005, we reached an agreement in principle (and in
    September 2005 a final agreement) to settle more than 8,000
    claims for $690.0 million plus $10.0 million to cover
    administration of the settlement. That settlement is being
    administered by special settlement masters appointed by Judge
    Weinstein.

•

In January 2007, we reached agreements with a number of
    plaintiffs’ attorneys to settle more than 18,000 claims for
    approximately $500 million.

-36-

The 2005 settlement totaling $700.0 million was paid during
    2005. The January 2007 settlements were recorded in other
    current liabilities in our December 31, 2006 consolidated
    balance sheet and will be paid in the first quarter of 2007.

The U.S. Zyprexa product liability claims not subject to
    these agreements include approximately 340 lawsuits in the
    U.S. covering approximately 900 claimants and an additional
    400 claims of which we are aware. In addition, we have been
    served with a lawsuit seeking class certification in which the
    members of the purported class are seeking refunds and medical
    monitoring. In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits
    seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of patients who
    took Zyprexa. One of these four lawsuits has been certified for
    residents of Quebec. The allegations in the Canadian actions are
    similar to those in the litigation pending in the U.S.

We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in
    all remaining cases. We currently anticipate that trials in
    seven cases in the Eastern District of New York will begin in
    the second quarter of 2007.

We have insurance coverage for a portion of our Zyprexa product
    liability claims exposure. The third party insurance carriers
    have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and
    are seeking to rescind the policies. The dispute is now the
    subject of litigation in the federal court in Indianapolis
    against certain of the carriers and in arbitration in Bermuda
    against other carriers. While we believe our position has merit,
    there can be no assurance that we will prevail.

In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other
    product liability lawsuits involving primarily
    diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thimerosal. The majority of these
    claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and
    coverage limits.

In the second quarter of 2005, we recorded a net pretax charge
    of $1.07 billion for product liability matters. The charge
    took into account our estimated recoveries from our insurance
    coverage related to these matters. The charge covered the
    following:

•

The cost of the June 2005 Zyprexa settlements described
    above; and

•

Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs
    regarding the then-known and expected product liability claims
    to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the
    probable number and cost of the claims. A substantial majority
    of those exposures and costs were related to then-known and
    expected Zyprexa claims.

As a result of the January 2007 settlements discussed above, we
    incurred a pretax charge of $494.9 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2006. The charge covered the following:

•

The cost of the January 2007 Zyprexa settlements; and

•

Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs
    regarding the then-known and expected Zyprexa product liability
    claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of
    the probable number and cost of the claims.

In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in
    state court in Louisiana on behalf of the Louisiana Department
    of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or
    contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that
    we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have been removed
    to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the
    Eastern District of New York. In these actions, the Department
    of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for
    Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as
    well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and
    will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. In 2006, we were
    served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, West
    Virginia, New Mexico, and Mississippi in the courts of the
    respective states.

In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New
    York purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all
    consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental
    entities, which have made or will make payments for their
    members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These
    actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which
    is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the
    federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a
    refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages,

-37-

punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. Two additional
    lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York in 2006
    on similar grounds. As with the product liability suits, these
    lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about
    side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug.

We cannot predict with certainty the additional number of
    lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. In addition, although
    we believe it is probable, there can be no assurance that the
    January 2007 Zyprexa product liability settlements described
    above will be concluded. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa
    product liability and related litigation could have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
    liquidity, and financial position.

Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible
    that we could become subject to large numbers of product
    liability and related claims for other products in the future.
    In the past few years, we have experienced difficulties in
    obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive
    insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our
    currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we
    will continue to be largely self-insured for future product
    liability losses. In addition, as noted above, there is no
    assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our
    insurance carriers on past claims.

Segment
    Information

We operate in one significant business segment —
    pharmaceutical products. Operations of the animal health
    business segment are not material and share many of the same
    economic and operating characteristics as pharmaceutical
    products. Therefore, they are included with pharmaceutical
    products for purposes of segment reporting.

Net sales are attributed to the countries based on the location
    of the customer.

The largest category of products is the neurosciences group,
    which includes Zyprexa, Cymbalta, Strattera, and Prozac.
    Endocrinology products consist primarily of Humalog, Humulin,
    Actos, Byetta, Evista, Forteo, and Humatrope. Oncology products
    consist primarily of Gemzar and Alimta. Animal health products
    include
    Tylan

®

,
    Rumensin

®

,
    Coban

®

,
    and other products for livestock and poultry. Cardiovascular
    products consist primarily of ReoPro and Xigris. Anti-infectives
    include primarily
    Ceclor

®

and
    Vancocin

®

.
    The other pharmaceuticals category includes Cialis, Axid, and
    other miscellaneous pharmaceutical products and services.

Most of our pharmaceutical products are distributed through
    wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other health
    care professionals, and hospitals. In 2006, our three largest
    wholesalers each accounted for between 12 percent and
    17 percent of consolidated net sales. Further, they each
    accounted for between 10 percent and 14 percent of
    accounts receivable as of December 31, 2006. Animal health
    products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors.

-43-

Our business segments are distinguished by the ultimate end user
    of the product: humans or animals. Performance is evaluated
    based on profit or loss from operations before income taxes. The
    accounting policies of the individual segments are substantially
    the same as those described in the summary of significant
    accounting policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements. Income before income taxes for the animal health
    business was approximately $184 million, $215 million,
    and $223 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

The assets of the animal health business are intermixed with
    those of the pharmaceutical products business. Long-lived assets
    disclosed above consist of property and equipment and certain
    sundry assets.

We are exposed to the risk of changes in social, political, and
    economic conditions inherent in foreign operations, and our
    results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are
    affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

ELI LILLY AND COMPANY AND
    SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except per-share data)

Note 1:  Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation:

The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting practices generally accepted in the United States
    (GAAP). The accounts of all wholly owned and majority-owned
    subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
    statements. Where our ownership of consolidated subsidiaries is
    less than 100 percent, the outside shareholders’
    interests are reflected in other noncurrent liabilities. All
    intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
    expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial
    statements and during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

All per-share amounts, unless otherwise noted in the footnotes,
    are presented on a diluted basis, that is, based on the
    weighted-average number of outstanding common shares plus the
    effect of dilutive stock options and other incremental shares.

Cash equivalents:

We consider all highly liquid
    investments, with a maturity of three months or less, to be cash
    equivalents. The cost of these investments approximates fair
    value. If items meeting this definition are part of a larger
    investment pool, they are classified consistent with the
    classification of the pool.

Inventories:

We state all inventories at the lower of
    cost or market. We use the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all our inventories
    located in the continental United States, or approximately
    46 percent of our total inventories. Other inventories are
    valued by the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method. FIFO cost approximates current
    replacement cost. Inventories at December 31 consisted of
    the following:

Investments:

Substantially all debt and marketable equity
    securities are classified as

available-for-sale.

Available-

for-sale

securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains
    and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income.
    Unrealized losses considered to be

other-than-temporary

are recognized in earnings. Factors we consider in making this
    evaluation include company-specific drivers of the decrease in
    stock price, status of projects in development, near-term
    prospects of the issuer, the length of time the value has been
    depressed, and the financial condition of the industry. We do
    not evaluate cost-method investments for impairment unless there
    is an indicator of impairment. We review these investments for
    indicators of impairment on a regular basis. Realized gains and
    losses on sales of

available-for-sale

securities are computed based upon specific identification of
    the initial cost adjusted for any

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value. Investments in companies over which we
    have significant influence but not a controlling interest are
    accounted for using the equity method with our share of earnings
    or losses reported in other income — net. We own no
    investments that are considered to be trading securities.

Risk-management instruments:

Our derivative activities
    are initiated within the guidelines of documented corporate
    risk-management policies and do not create additional risk
    because gains and losses on derivative contracts offset losses
    and gains on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being
    hedged. As derivative

-47-

contracts are initiated, we designate the instruments
    individually as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.
    Management reviews the correlation and effectiveness of our
    derivatives on a quarterly basis.

For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair
    value hedges, the derivative instrument is marked to market with
    gains and losses recognized currently in income to offset the
    respective losses and gains recognized on the underlying
    exposure. For derivative contracts that are designated and
    qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of gains and
    losses on these contracts is reported as a component of other
    comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same
    period the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge
    ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings.
    Derivative contracts that are not designated as hedging
    instruments are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss
    recognized in current earnings during the period of change.

We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to
    reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates
    (principally the euro and the Japanese yen). Foreign currency
    derivatives used for hedging are put in place using the same or
    like currencies and duration as the underlying exposures.
    Forward contracts are principally used to manage exposures
    arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables
    denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are recorded
    at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in other income.
    The purchased option contracts are used to hedge anticipated
    foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany inventory
    activities expected to occur within the next year. These
    contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of those future
    transactions and the impact on earnings is included in cost of
    sales. We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts and
    currency swaps as fair value hedges of firm commitments. Forward
    and option contracts generally have maturities not exceeding
    12 months.

In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to
    fluctuations in interest rates. These fluctuations can vary the
    costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a
    portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk
    management that includes the use of derivative financial
    instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to
    limit the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on earnings.
    Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in
    short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to
    manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an
    acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt and
    investment positions and may enter into interest rate swaps or
    collars to help maintain that balance. Interest rate swaps or
    collars that convert our fixed rate debt or investments to a
    floating rate are designated as fair value hedges of the
    underlying instruments. Interest rate swaps or collars that
    convert floating rate debt or investments to a fixed rate are
    designated as cash flow hedges. Interest expense on the debt is
    adjusted to include the payments made or received under the swap
    agreements.

Goodwill and other intangibles:

Other intangibles with
    finite lives arising from acquisitions and research alliances
    are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5
    to 15 years, using the straight-line method. Goodwill is
    not amortized. Goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed to
    assess recoverability at least annually and when certain
    impairment indicators are present. Goodwill and net other
    intangibles with finite lives were $130.0 million and
    $139.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, and were included in sundry assets in the consolidated
    balance sheets. Goodwill is our only intangible asset with an
    indefinite life. No material impairments occurred with respect
    to the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets
    in 2006, 2005, or 2004.

Property and equipment:

Property and equipment is stated
    on the basis of cost. Provisions for depreciation of buildings
    and equipment are computed generally by the straight-line method
    at rates based on their estimated useful lives (12 to
    50 years for buildings and 3 to 18 years for
    equipment). We review the carrying value of long-lived assets
    for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events
    or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an
    asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is determined by
    comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by
    the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified,
    a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net
    book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.

Depreciation expense for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was
    $627.4 million, $577.2 million, and
    $495.9 million, respectively. Approximately
    $106.7 million, $140.5 million, and
    $111.3 million of interest costs were capitalized as part
    of property and equipment in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
    Total rental expense for all leases, including contingent
    rentals (not material), amounted to approximately
    $293.6 million, $294.4 million, and
    $286.8 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
    Capital leases included in property and equipment in the
    consolidated balance sheets, capital lease obligations entered
    into, and future minimum rental commitments are not material.

Litigation and environmental liabilities:

Litigation
    accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated
    insurance recoverables are reflected on a gross basis as
    liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated
    balance sheets. With respect to the product liability claims
    currently asserted against us, we have accrued for our estimated
    exposures to the extent they are both probable and estimable
    based on the information available to us. We accrue for certain
    product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we
    can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate
    these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience
    and data regarding product usage. Legal defense costs expected
    to be incurred in connection with significant product liability
    loss contingencies are accrued when probable and reasonably
    estimable. A portion of the costs associated with defending and
    disposing of these suits is covered by insurance. We record
    receivables for insurance-related recoveries when it is probable
    they will be realized. These receivables are classified as a
    reduction of the litigation charges on the statement of income.
    We estimate insurance recoverables based on existing
    deductibles, coverage limits, our assessment of any defenses to
    coverage that might be raised by the carriers, and the existing
    and projected future level of insolvencies among the insurance
    carriers.

Revenue recognition:

We recognize revenue from sales of
    products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the
    buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. For more than
    90 percent of our sales, this is at the time products are
    shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale distributor or a
    major retail chain. The remaining sales are recorded at the
    point of delivery. Provisions for discounts and rebates are
    established in the same period the related sales are recorded.

We also generate income as a result of collaboration agreements.
    Revenue from copromotion services is based upon net sales
    reported by our copromotion partners and, if applicable, the
    number of sales calls we perform. Initial fees we receive from
    the partnering of our compounds under development are amortized
    through the expected product approval date. Initial fees
    received from out-licensing agreements that include both the
    sale of marketing rights to our commercialized products and a
    related commitment to supply the products are generally
    recognized as net sales over the term of the supply agreement.
    We immediately recognize the full amount of milestone payments
    due to us upon the achievement of the milestone event if the
    event is substantive, objectively determinable, and represents
    an important point in the development life cycle of the
    pharmaceutical product. Milestone payments earned by us are
    generally recorded in other income — net.

Research and development:

We recognize as incurred the
    cost of directly acquiring assets to be used in the research and
    development process that have not yet received regulatory
    approval for marketing and for which no alternative future use
    has been identified. Once the product has obtained regulatory
    approval, we capitalize

-49-

the milestones paid and amortize them over the period benefited.
    Milestones paid prior to regulatory approval of the product are
    generally expensed when the event requiring payment of the
    milestone occurs.

Other income — net:

The joint venture (income) loss represents our share of the
    Lilly ICOS LLC joint venture results of operations, net of
    income taxes. We acquired the complete ownership of the joint
    venture in January 2007 as a result of our acquisition of ICOS.
    See Note 3 for further discussion.

Income taxes:

Deferred taxes are recognized for the
    future tax effects of temporary differences between financial
    and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates.
    Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income
    of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the
    United States and be taxable. We record a liability for tax
    contingencies when we believe it is probable that we will be
    assessed and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably
    estimated. The tax contingency reserve is adjusted for changes
    in facts and circumstances, and additional uncertainties. See
    Note 10 regarding the 2004 tax expense associated with the
    completed repatriation of earnings reinvested outside the
    U.S. pursuant to the American Jobs Creations Act.

Earnings per share:

We calculate basic earnings per share
    based on the weighted-average number of outstanding common
    shares and incremental shares. We calculate diluted earnings per
    share based on the weighted-average number of outstanding common
    shares plus the effect of dilutive stock options and other
    incremental shares.

Stock-based compensation:

As discussed further in
    Note 7, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment
    (SFAS 123R), effective January 1, 2005. SFAS 123R
    requires the recognition of the fair value of stock-based
    compensation in net income. Stock-based compensation primarily
    consists of stock options and performance awards. Stock options
    are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair
    market value of our stock at the dates of grant. Options fully
    vest three years from the grant date and have a term of
    10 years. Performance awards are granted to officers and
    key employees and are payable in shares of our common stock. The
    number of performance award shares actually issued, if any,
    varies depending on the achievement of certain

earnings-per-share

targets. Performance awards fully vest at the end of the fiscal
    year of the grant. We recognize the stock-based compensation
    expense over the requisite service period of the individual
    grantees, which generally equals the vesting period. We provide
    newly issued shares and treasury stock to satisfy stock option
    exercises and for the issuance of performance awards.

Under our policy, all stock option awards are approved prior to
    the date of grant and the exercise price is the average of the
    high and low market price on the date of grant. The Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors approves the value of the
    award and the date of grant. Options that are awarded as part of
    annual total compensation are made on specific grant dates
    scheduled in advance. With respect to option awards given to new
    hires, our policy requires approval of such awards prior to the
    grant date, and the options are granted on a pre-determined
    monthly date immediately following the date of hire.

Prior to January 1, 2005, we followed Accounting Principles
    Board (APB) Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for our
    stock options and performance awards. Under APB 25, because
    the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the
    market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
    compensation expense was recognized. However, SFAS 123R
    requires us to present pro forma information as if we had
    accounted for our employee stock options and performance awards
    under the fair value method of that statement. For purposes of
    pro forma disclosure, the

-50-

estimated fair value of the options and performance awards at
    the date of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite
    service period, which generally is the vesting period.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and
    earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition
    provisions of SFAS 123R to stock-based employee
    compensation.

Implementation
    of New Financial Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. The Interpretation is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2006; therefore, we are
    required to adopt this Interpretation in the first quarter of
    2007. While we have not yet completed our analysis, we expect
    the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material impact on
    retained earnings, and that we will reclassify approximately
    $900 million to $960 million of income taxes payable
    from current to noncurrent liabilities.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158,
    Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
    Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS 158 requires the
    recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined
    benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its
    statement of financial position, the measurement of a
    plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded
    status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year, and the
    recognition of changes in that funded status through
    comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur.
    Additional footnote disclosures are also required. SFAS 158
    was effective December 31, 2006. See Note 12 for
    further discussion of the impact of adopting this pronouncement.

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (SAB) No. 108, which provides interpretive guidance on how
    the effects of carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements
    should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement.
    SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after
    November 15, 2006, and did not have an impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional
    Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB
    Statement No. 143. FIN 47 requires us to record the
    fair value of a liability for conditional asset retirement
    obligations in the period in which it is incurred, which is
    adjusted to its present value each subsequent period. In
    addition, we are required to capitalize a corresponding amount
    by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived
    asset, which is depreciated over the useful life of the related
    long-lived asset. The adoption of FIN 47 on
    December 31, 2005 resulted in a cumulative effect of a
    change in accounting principle of $22.0 million, net of

Acquisitions

ICOS Corporation
    Acquisition

On January 29, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock of ICOS Corporation (ICOS), our partner in the
    Lilly ICOS LLC joint venture that manufactures, markets and
    sells Cialis for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The
    acquisition brings the full value of Cialis to us and will
    enable us to realize operational efficiencies in the further
    development, marketing and selling of this product.

Under the terms of the agreement, each outstanding share of ICOS
    common stock was redeemed for $34 in cash for an aggregate
    purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion, which was
    financed through borrowings. While the allocation of the
    purchase price has not been finalized, we anticipate that
    approximately $1.7 billion of the purchase price will be
    allocated to the acquired intangible asset related to Cialis and
    approximately $300 million to acquired in-process research
    and development (IPR&D). The intangible asset will be
    amortized over Cialis’ remaining expected patent lives in
    each country, which range from 2015 to 2017. A deferred tax
    liability of approximately $700 million will be established
    related to the intangible asset. Approximately $800 million
    will be recorded as goodwill and is not expected to be
    deductible for tax purposes. We will include the IPR&D as an
    expense in the first quarter of 2007 and will include ICOS’
    results of operations subsequent to the acquisition in our 2007
    consolidated financial statements. The IPR&D charge is not
    deductible for tax purposes.

Applied
    Molecular Evolution, Inc. Acquisition

On February 12, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock of Applied Molecular Evolution, Inc. (AME) in a
    tax-free merger. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each
    outstanding share of AME common stock was exchanged for our
    common stock or a combination of cash and our stock valued at
    $18. The aggregate purchase price of approximately
    $442.8 million consisted of issuance of 4.2 million
    shares of our common stock valued at $314.8 million,
    issuance of 0.7 million replacement options to purchase
    shares of our common stock in exchange for the remaining
    outstanding AME options valued at $37.6 million, cash of
    $85.4 million for AME common stock and options for certain
    AME employees, and transaction costs of $5.0 million. The
    fair value of our common stock was derived using a per-share
    value of $74.14, which was our average closing stock price for
    February 11 and 12, 2004. The fair value for the options
    granted was derived using a Black-Scholes valuation method using
    assumptions consistent with those we used in valuing employee
    options. Replacement options to purchase our common stock
    granted as part of this acquisition have terms equivalent to the
    AME options being replaced. AME’s results of operations
    subsequent to the acquisition are included in our consolidated
    financial statements.

We hired independent third parties to assist in the valuation of
    assets that were difficult to value. Of the $442.8 million
    purchase price, $362.3 million was attributable to acquired
    IPR&D. The IPR&D represents compounds that were under
    development at that time and that had not yet achieved
    regulatory approval for marketing. AME’s two lead compounds
    for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and rheumatoid
    arthritis represented approximately 80 percent of the
    estimated fair value of the IPR&D. These IPR&D
    intangible assets were written off by a charge to income
    immediately subsequent to the acquisition because the compounds
    did not have any alternative future use. This charge was not
    deductible for tax purposes. The ongoing activity with respect
    to each of these compounds under development is not material to
    our research and development expenses.

There are several methods that can be used to determine the
    estimated fair value of the acquired IPR&D. We utilized the
    “income method,” which applies a probability weighting
    to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from
    projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These projections
    were based on factors such as relevant market size, patent
    protection, historical pricing of similar products, and expected
    industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows were then
    discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount
    rate. This analysis was performed for each project
    independently. The discount rate we used in valuing the acquired
    IPR&D projects was 18.75 percent.

Product
    Acquisitions

In January 2007, we entered into an agreement with OSI
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to acquire the rights to its compound for
    the potential treatment of Type 2 diabetes. At the inception of
    this agreement, this compound was in the development stage
    (Phase I clinical trials) and had no alternative future
    uses. As with many development phase compounds, launch of the
    product, if approved, was not expected in the near term. Our
    charge for acquired IPR&D related to this arrangement was
    $25.0 million and will be included as expense in the first
    quarter of 2007.

In 2004, we incurred an IPR&D charge of $29.9 million
    related to a development stage compound acquired from Merck KGaA
    for a potential treatment for insomnia. This compound did not
    have any alternative future use.

Note 4:

Asset
    Impairments, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges

The components of the charges included in asset impairments,
    restructuring, and other special charges in our consolidated
    statements of income are described below.

Asset
    Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other
    Charges

In the fourth quarter of 2006, management approved plans to
    close two research and development facilities and one production
    facility outside the U.S. Management also made the decision
    to stop construction of a planned insulin manufacturing plant in
    the U.S. in an effort to increase productivity in research
    and development operations and to reduce excess manufacturing
    capacity. These decisions, as well as other strategic changes,
    resulted in non-cash charges of $308.8 million for the
    write-down of certain impaired assets, substantially all of
    which have no future use, and other charges of
    $141.5 million, primarily related to severance and contract
    termination payments. The impairment charges are necessary to
    adjust the carrying value of the assets to fair value. In
    addition, in early 2007 the Board approved other related actions
    to offer voluntary severance to up to 250 employees at one of
    our plants in the U.S. Severance and other costs related to
    all of these actions will result in estimated additional charges
    of approximately $125 million (pretax) in the first quarter
    of 2007. We expect to complete these restructuring activities by
    December 31, 2007.

In December 2005, management approved, as part of our ongoing
    efforts to increase productivity and reduce our cost structure,
    decisions that resulted in non-cash charges of
    $154.6 million for the write-down of certain impaired
    assets, and other charges of $17.3 million, primarily
    related to contract termination payments. The impaired assets,
    which have no future use, include manufacturing buildings and
    equipment no longer needed to supply projected capacity
    requirements, as well as obsolete research and development
    equipment. The impairment charges are necessary to adjust the
    carrying value of the assets to fair value.

During 2004, management approved actions designed to increase
    productivity, to address current challenges in the marketplace,
    and to leverage prior investments in our product portfolio.
    These actions affected primarily operations in the
    manufacturing, research and development, and sales and marketing
    components and resulted in asset impairments, severance and
    other related charges. As a result, we recognized asset
    impairment charges of $486.3 million. We have ceased using
    these assets, and have disposed of or destroyed substantially
    all of the assets. The impairment charges are necessary to
    adjust the carrying value of the assets to fair value. Other
    site charges, including lease termination payments, were
    $12.2 million. The restructuring and other charges incurred
    and expended related to the elimination of positions as a result
    of these actions totaled $68.5 million, including
    $35.1 million of severance charges related to restructuring
    activities in our overseas affiliates. The severance charges
    consisted primarily of voluntary severance expenses.

Product
    Liability and Other Special Charges

As discussed further in Note 13, we have reached agreements
    with claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa
    product liability litigation to settle a total of approximately
    28,500 claims against us relating to the medication.
    Approximately 1,300 claims remain. As a result of our product
    liability exposures, the substantial majority of which were
    related to Zyprexa, we recorded net pretax charges of
    $494.9 million in 2006 and $1.07 billion in 2005.

-53-

The other significant component of our 2004 special charges was
    a provision for $36.0 million for the resolution of the
    previously reported Evista marketing and promotional practices
    investigation. See Note 13 for additional discussion.

Note 5:

Financial
    Instruments and Investments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk
    consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing
    investments. Wholesale distributors of life-sciences products
    and managed care organizations account for a substantial portion
    of trade receivables; collateral is generally not required. The
    risk associated with this concentration is mitigated by our
    ongoing credit review procedures. We place substantially all our
    interest-bearing investments with major financial institutions,
    in U.S. government securities, or with top-rated corporate
    issuers. At December 31, 2006, our investments in debt
    securities were comprised of 41 percent asset-backed
    securities, 29 percent corporate securities, and
    30 percent U.S. government securities. In accordance
    with documented corporate policies, we limit the amount of
    credit exposure to any one financial institution or corporate
    issuer. We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of
    nonperformance by counterparties to financial instruments but do
    not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations
    given their high credit ratings.

We determine fair values based on quoted market values where
    available or discounted cash flow analyses (principally
    long-term debt). The fair value of equity method and other
    investments is not readily available and disclosure is not
    required. Approximately $1.2 billion of our investments in
    debt securities mature within five years.

    the portion of our risk-management hedging instruments, fair
    value and cash flow hedges, excluded from the assessment of
    effectiveness were not material.

We expect to reclassify an estimated $25.5 million of
    pretax net losses on cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign
    currency transactions and the variability in expected future
    interest payments on floating rate debt from accumulated other
    comprehensive loss to earnings during 2007. This assumes that
    short-term interest rates remain unchanged from the prevailing
    rates at December 31, 2006.

In August 2005, Eli Lilly Services, Inc. (ELSI), our indirect
    wholly-owned finance subsidiary, issued $1.50 billion of

13-month

floating rate extendible notes. The maturity date of these notes
    is January 1, 2008, but holders of the notes may extend the
    maturity of the notes, in monthly increments, until
    September 1, 2010. These notes pay interest at essentially
    a rate equivalent to LIBOR (5.34 percent at
    December 31, 2006). We repaid $500.0 million of the
    notes in December 2006. The parent company fully and
    unconditionally guarantees the ELSI notes.

In September 2005, ELSI issued $1.50 billion of floating
    rate bonds with a maturity date in 2008. We repaid
    $1.00 billion of the notes in September 2006 and the
    remaining $500.0 million in December 2006. The remaining
    $400.0 million of floating rate bonds outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 are due in 2037 and have variable
    interest rates at LIBOR plus our six-month credit spread,
    adjusted semiannually (total of 5.46 percent at
    December 31, 2006). The interest was to accumulate over the
    life of the bonds and be payable upon maturity. We had an option
    to begin periodic interest payments at any time. We exercised
    this option in November 2006 and paid all previously accrued
    interest on the bonds.

Principal and interest on the private placement bonds due in
    2007 and 2008 are due semiannually over the remaining terms of
    each of these notes. In conjunction with these bonds, we entered
    into interest rate swap

-55-

agreements with the same financial institution, which converts
    the fixed rate into a variable rate of interest at essentially
    LIBOR over the term of the bonds.

The 6.55 percent Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)
    debentures are obligations of the ESOP but are shown on the
    consolidated balance sheet because we guarantee them. The
    principal and interest on the debt are funded by contributions
    from us and by dividends received on certain shares held by the
    ESOP. Because of the amortizing feature of the ESOP debt,
    bondholders will receive both interest and principal payments
    each quarter.

The aggregate amounts of maturities on long-term debt for the
    next five years are as follows: 2007, $210.8 million; 2008,
    $1.40 billion; 2009, $21.5 million; 2010,
    $19.4 million; and 2011, $16.0 million.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, short-term borrowings
    included $8.6 million and $13.4 million, respectively,
    of notes payable to banks and commercial paper. At
    December 31, 2006, we have $1.21 billion of unused
    committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which
    backs our commercial paper program. Compensating balances and
    commitment fees are not material, and there are no conditions
    that are probable of occurring under which the lines may be
    withdrawn.

We have converted substantially all fixed-rate debt to floating
    rates through the use of interest rate swaps. The
    weighted-average effective borrowing rates based on debt
    obligations and interest rates at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, including the effects of interest rate swaps for hedged
    debt obligations, were 5.89 percent and 4.75 percent,
    respectively.

In 2006 and 2005, cash payments of interest on borrowings
    totaled $299.6 million and $32.0 million,
    respectively, net of capitalized interest. In 2004, capitalized
    interest exceeded cash payments of interest on borrowings, due
    in large part to certain debt instruments requiring interest
    payments only at maturity, as previously noted.

In accordance with the requirements of SFAS 133, the
    portion of our fixed-rate debt obligations that is hedged is
    reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as an amount equal
    to the sum of the debt’s carrying value plus the fair value
    adjustment representing changes in fair value of the hedged debt
    attributable to movements in market interest rates subsequent to
    the inception of the hedge.

Note 7:

Stock
    Plans

We adopted SFAS 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment
    (SFAS 123R), effective January 1, 2005. SFAS 123R
    requires the recognition of the fair value of stock-based
    compensation in net income. Stock-based compensation primarily
    consists of stock options and performance awards. Stock options
    are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair
    market value of our stock at the dates of grant. Options fully
    vest three years from the grant date and have a term of
    10 years. Performance awards are granted to officers and
    key employees and are payable in shares of our common stock. The
    number of performance award shares actually issued, if any,
    varies depending on the achievement of certain

earnings-per-share

targets. Performance awards fully vest at the end of the fiscal
    year of the grant. We recognize the stock-based compensation
    expense over the requisite service period of the individual
    grantees, which generally equals the vesting period. We provide
    newly issued shares and treasury stock to satisfy stock option
    exercises and for the issuance of performance awards.

Prior to January 1, 2005, we followed Accounting Principles
    Board (APB) Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for our
    stock options and performance awards. Under APB 25, because
    the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the
    market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
    compensation expense was recognized. See Note 1 for a
    calculation of our net income and earnings per share if we had
    applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R
    to stock-based employee compensation in 2004.

We elected the modified prospective transition method for
    adopting SFAS 123R. Under this method, the provisions of
    SFAS 123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the
    date of adoption. In addition, the unrecognized expense of
    awards not yet vested at the date of adoption, determined under
    the original

-56-

provisions of SFAS 123, shall be recognized in net income
    in the periods after the date of adoption. We recognized
    stock-based compensation cost in the amount of
    $359.3 million, $403.5 million, and
    $53.0 million, in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, as
    well as related tax benefits of $115.9 million,
    $122.9 million, and $18.5 million, respectively. The
    amounts for 2004 relate only to expenses for performance awards
    because no expense was recognized for stock options under
    APB 25. In addition, after adopting SFAS 123R, we now
    classify tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of
    the compensation cost recognized for exercised stock options as
    a financing cash flow in the consolidated statements of cash
    flows rather than an operating cash flow as under our previous
    disclosure.

In connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R, we reassessed
    the valuation methodology for stock options and the related
    input assumptions. As a result, beginning with the 2005 stock
    option grant, we utilized a lattice-based option valuation model
    for estimating the fair value of the stock options. The lattice
    model allows the use of a range of assumptions related to
    volatility, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise
    behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the lattice model
    are based on implied volatilities from traded options on our
    stock, historical volatility of our stock price, and other
    factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical
    experience and our estimate of future dividend yields. The
    risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury
    yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The model
    incorporates exercise and post-vesting forfeiture assumptions
    based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of
    the 2006 and 2005 grants are derived from the output of the
    lattice model.

Prior to 2005, we utilized a Black-Scholes option-pricing model
    to estimate the fair value of the options. This model did not
    allow for the input of a range of factors. Accordingly,
    volatility was derived from the historical volatility of our
    stock price and the risk-free interest rate was derived from the
    weighted-average yield of a treasury security with the same term
    as the expected life of the options. The expected life of the
    options was based on the weighted-average life of our historical
    option grants and the dividend yield was based on our historical
    dividends paid.

The weighted-average fair values of the individual options
    granted during 2006, 2005, and 2004 were $15.61, $16.06, and
    $26.19, respectively, determined using the following assumptions:

The intrinsic value of options exercised during 2006, 2005, and
    2004 amounted to $40.8 million, $131.9 million, and
    $163.8 million, respectively. The total grant date fair
    value of options vested during 2006, 2005, and 2004, amounted to
    $249.1 million, $265.5 million, and
    $337.2 million, respectively. We received cash of
    $66.2 million, $105.9 million, and $117.9 million
    from exercises of stock options during 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    respectively, and recognized related tax benefits of
    $11.3 million, $36.8 million, and $36.8 million
    during those same years.

As of December 31, 2006, the total remaining unrecognized
    compensation cost related to nonvested stock options amounted to
    $83.1 million, which will be amortized over the
    weighted-average remaining requisite service period of
    17 months. The number of shares ultimately issued for the
    performance award program is dependent upon the earnings
    achieved during the vesting period. Pursuant to this plan, no
    shares were issued in 2004, and approximately 0.5 million
    shares and 1.7 million shares were issued in 2005 and 2006,
    respectively. Approximately 2.1 million shares are expected
    to be issued in 2007.

At December 31, 2006, additional options, performance
    awards, or restricted stock grants may be granted under the 2002
    Lilly Stock Plan for not more than 45.2 million shares.

Note 8:

Other
    Assets and Other Liabilities

Our sundry assets include our capitalized computer software,
    estimated insurance recoveries from our product litigation and
    environmental contingencies (Note 13), deferred tax assets,
    goodwill and intangible assets (Note 1), and a variety of
    other items. The decrease in sundry assets is primarily
    attributable to the decrease in prepaid retiree health benefits
    as a result of the adoption of SFAS 158 (Note 12).

Our other current liabilities include product litigation and
    environmental liabilities (Note 13), other taxes, and a
    variety of other items. The increase in other current
    liabilities is caused primarily by an increase in product
    litigation liabilities offset by a decrease in interest rate
    swaps.

Our other noncurrent liabilities include product litigation and
    environmental liabilities (Note 13), deferred income from
    our collaboration and out-licensing arrangements, and a variety
    of other items. The decrease in other noncurrent liabilities is
    primarily attributable to a decrease in product litigation and
    environmental liabilities, which is now reflected in other
    current liabilities, offset by an increase in deferred income
    from our collaboration and out-licensing arrangements.

As of December 31, 2006, we have purchased
    $2.58 billion of our announced $3.0 billion share
    repurchase program. We acquired approximately 2.1 million
    and 6.7 million shares in 2006 and 2005, respectively,
    under this program.

We have 5 million authorized shares of preferred stock. As
    of December 31, 2006 and 2005, no preferred stock has been
    issued.

We have funded an employee benefit trust with 40 million
    shares of Lilly common stock to provide a source of funds to
    assist us in meeting our obligations under various employee
    benefit plans. The funding had no net impact on
    shareholders’ equity as we consolidate the employee benefit
    trust. The cost basis of the shares held in the trust was
    $2.64 billion and is shown as a reduction in
    shareholders’ equity, which offsets the resulting

-59-

increases of $2.61 billion in additional paid-in capital
    and $25 million in common stock. Any dividend transactions
    between us and the trust are eliminated. Stock held by the trust
    is not considered outstanding in the computation of earnings per
    share. The assets of the trust were not used to fund any of our
    obligations under these employee benefit plans in 2006, 2005, or
    2004.

We have an ESOP as a funding vehicle for the existing employee
    savings plan. The ESOP used the proceeds of a loan from us to
    purchase shares of common stock from the treasury. The ESOP
    issued $200 million of third-party debt, repayment of which
    was guaranteed by us (see Note 6). The proceeds were used
    to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market.
    Shares of common stock held by the ESOP will be allocated to
    participating employees annually through 2017 as part of our
    savings plan contribution. The fair value of shares allocated
    each period is recognized as compensation expense.

Under a Shareholder Rights Plan adopted in 1998, all
    shareholders receive, along with each common share owned, a
    preferred stock purchase right entitling them to purchase from
    the company one one-thousandth of a share of Series B
    Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock) at a
    price of $325. The rights are exercisable only after the
    Distribution Date, which is generally the 10th business day
    after the date of a public announcement that a person (the
    Acquiring Person) has acquired ownership of 15 percent or
    more of our common stock. We may redeem the rights for
    $.005 per right, up to and including the Distribution Date.
    The rights will expire on July 28, 2008, unless we redeem
    them earlier.

The rights plan provides that, if an Acquiring Person acquires
    15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock and our
    redemption right has expired, generally each holder of a right
    (other than the Acquiring Person) will have the right to
    purchase at the exercise price the number of shares of our
    common stock that have a value of two times the exercise price.

Alternatively, if, in a transaction not approved by the board of
    directors, we are acquired in a business combination transaction
    or sell 50 percent or more of our assets or earning power
    after a Distribution Date, generally each holder of a right
    (other than the Acquiring Person) will have the right to
    purchase at the exercise price the number of shares of common
    stock of the acquiring company that have a value of two times
    the exercise price.

At any time after an Acquiring Person has acquired
    15 percent or more but less than 50 percent of our
    outstanding common stock, the board of directors may exchange
    the rights (other than those owned by the Acquiring Person) for
    our common stock or Preferred Stock at an exchange ratio of one
    common share (or one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred
    Stock) per right.

At December 31, 2006, we had other carryforwards, including
    net operating loss carryforwards, for international and
    U.S. income tax purposes of $34.7 million:
    $29.1 million will expire within five years;
    $5.6 million of the carryforwards will never expire. The
    primary component of the remaining portion of the deferred tax
    asset for other carryforwards is related to net operating losses
    for state income tax purposes that are fully reserved. We also
    have tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks of
    $286.9 million available to reduce future income taxes;
    $80.7 million will be carried back and $12.0 million
    of the tax credit carryforwards will never expire. The remaining
    portion of the tax credit carryforwards is related to state tax
    credits that are fully reserved. The reduction in the deferred
    tax liability for prepaid employee benefits was a result of the
    adoption of SFAS 158 in 2006 (Note 12).

Domestic and Puerto Rican companies contributed approximately
    18 percent, 43 percent, and 6 percent in 2006,
    2005, and 2004, respectively, to consolidated income before
    income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting
    principle. We have a subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico under a
    tax incentive grant that begins to expire at the end of 2007. We
    have a new tax incentive grant, not yet in effect, that will
    last for a period of at least 10 years from its inception
    date.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) created a
    temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
    undistributed income earned abroad by providing an
    85 percent dividends received deduction for certain
    dividends from controlled foreign corporations in 2005. We
    recorded a related tax liability of $465.0 million as of
    December 31, 2004, and subsequently repatriated
    $8.00 billion in incentive dividends, as defined in the
    AJCA, during 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had an
    aggregate of $5.7 billion of unremitted earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries that have been or are intended to be permanently
    reinvested for continued use in foreign operations and that, if
    distributed, would result in taxes at approximately the
    U.S. statutory rate.

Cash payments of income taxes totaled $864.0 million,
    $1.78 billion, and $487.0 million in 2006, 2005, and
    2004, respectively. The higher cash payments of income taxes in
    2005 are primarily attributable to the tax

-61-

liability associated with the implementation of the AJCA and the
    resolution of an IRS examination for the years 1998 to 2000.

Note 12:

Retirement
    Benefits

On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and
    disclosure provisions of SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires
    that we recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit
    obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and the
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for our retiree
    health benefit plans) of our defined benefit pension plans and
    retiree health benefit plans in the December 31, 2006
    balance sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated
    other comprehensive loss, net of tax. The adjustment to
    accumulated other comprehensive loss at adoption represents the
    net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service
    costs, which were previously netted against the plans’
    funded status in our consolidated balance sheet pursuant to the
    prior accounting rules. The amounts in other comprehensive loss
    will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost
    pursuant to the prior accounting rules for amortizing such
    amounts, which were not changed by SFAS 158. Further,
    actuarial gains

-62-

and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not
    recognized as net periodic pension cost in the same period will
    be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income
    (loss). Those amounts will be subsequently recognized as a
    component of net periodic cost on the same basis as the amounts
    recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at
    adoption of SFAS 158.

The incremental effects of adopting the provisions of
    SFAS 158 on our consolidated balance sheet at
    December 31, 2006 are presented in the following table. The
    adoption of SFAS 158 had no effect on our consolidated
    statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    or for any prior period presented, and it will not affect our
    operating results in future periods. Had we not been required to
    adopt SFAS 158 at December 31, 2006, we would have
    recognized an additional minimum liability pursuant to the prior
    accounting rules. The effect of recognizing the additional
    minimum liability is included in the table below in the column
    labeled “Prior to Adopting SFAS 158.”

In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we have
    considered our historical assumptions compared with actual
    results, an analysis of current market conditions, asset
    allocations, and the views of leading financial advisers and
    economists. Our plan assets in our U.S. defined benefit
    pension and retiree health plans comprise approximately
    84 percent of our worldwide benefit plan assets. Including
    the investment losses due to overall market conditions in 2001
    and 2002, our 10- and

20-year

annualized rates of return on our U.S. defined benefit
    pension plans and retiree health benefit plan were approximately
    9.4 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively, as of
    December 31, 2006. Health-care-cost trend rates were
    assumed to increase at an annual rate of 8 percent in 2007,
    decreasing 1 percent per year to 6 percent in 2009 and
    thereafter.

-63-

We used a measurement date of December 31 to develop the
    change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets, funded
    status, and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance
    sheets at December 31 for our defined benefit pension and
    retiree health benefit plans, which were as follows:

    benefit pension plans and unrecognized net actuarial losses of
    $931.8 million and unrecognized prior service benefits of
    $85.7 million related to our retiree health benefit plans.
    In 2007, we expect to recognize from accumulated other
    comprehensive loss as components of net periodic benefit cost
    $119.7 million of unrecognized net actuarial loss and
    $7.7 million of unrecognized prior service cost related to
    our defined benefit pension plans and $92.3 million of
    unrecognized net actuarial loss and $15.6 million of
    unrecognized prior service benefit related to our retiree health
    benefit plans. We do not expect any plan assets to be returned
    to us in 2007.

If the health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one
    percentage point each future year, the December 31, 2006,
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would increase by
    11.0 percent and the aggregate of the service cost and
    interest cost components of the 2006 annual expense would
    increase by 16.4 percent. A one percentage-point decrease
    in these rates would decrease the December 31, 2006,
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
    9.9 percent and the aggregate of the 2006 service cost and
    interest cost by 14.1 percent.

We have defined contribution savings plans that cover our
    eligible employees worldwide. The purpose of these defined
    contribution plans is generally to provide additional financial
    security during retirement by providing employees with an
    incentive to save. Our contributions to the plan are based on
    employee contributions and the level of our match. Expenses
    under the plans totaled $106.5 million, $96.1 million,
    and $75.5 million for the years 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    respectively.

We provide certain other postemployment benefits primarily
    related to disability benefits and accrue for the related cost
    over the service lives of employees. Expenses associated with
    these benefit plans in 2006, 2005, and 2004 were not significant.

Our U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit
    plan investment allocation strategy currently comprises
    approximately 85 percent to 95 percent growth
    investments and 5 percent to 15 percent fixed-income
    investments. Within the growth investment classification, the
    plan asset strategy encompasses equity and equity-like
    instruments that are expected to represent approximately
    75 percent of our plan asset portfolio of both public and
    private market investments. The largest component of these
    equity and equity-like instruments is public equity securities
    that are well diversified and invested in U.S. and international

-65-

small-to-large

companies. The remaining portion of the growth investment
    classification is represented by other alternative growth
    investments.

Our defined benefit pension plan and retiree health plan asset
    allocations as of December 31 are as follows:

In 2007, we expect to contribute approximately $80 million
    to our defined benefit pension plans to satisfy minimum funding
    requirements for the year. In addition, we expect to contribute
    approximately $80 million of additional discretionary
    funding in 2007 to our defined benefit plans. We also expect to
    contribute approximately $75 million of discretionary
    funding to our postretirement health benefit plans during 2007.

Note 13:

Contingencies

We are a party to various legal actions, government
    investigations, and environmental proceedings. The most
    significant of these are described below. While it is not
    possible to predict or determine the outcome of these matters,
    we believe that, except as specifically noted below, the
    resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse
    effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but
    could possibly be material to our consolidated results of
    operations in any one accounting period.

Patent
    Litigation

We are engaged in the following patent litigation matters
    brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch- Waxman Act
    (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of
    1984):

•

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (Reddy), Teva
    Pharmaceuticals, and Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
    which was subsequently acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals
    (together, Teva), each submitted Abbreviated New Drug
    Applications (ANDAs) seeking permission to market generic
    versions of Zyprexa prior to the expiration of our relevant
    U.S. patent (expiring in 2011) and alleging that this
    patent was invalid or not enforceable. We filed lawsuits against
    these companies in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that the patent is valid,
    enforceable and being infringed. The district court ruled in our
    favor on all counts on April 14, 2005, and on
    December 26, 2006, that ruling was upheld by the Court of
    Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Reddy and Teva are seeking a
    review of that decision. We are confident that Reddy’s and
    Teva’s claims are without merit and we expect to prevail.
    An unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse impact on
    our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial
    position.

•

Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr), submitted an ANDA in 2002
    seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista prior
    to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (expiring in

2012-2017)

and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or
    not infringed. In November 2002, we filed a lawsuit against Barr
    in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
    Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid,
    enforceable, and being infringed by Barr. Teva has also
    submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a generic version
    of Evista. In June 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana,
    seeking a ruling that our relevant U.S. patents are valid,
    enforceable, and being infringed by Teva. No trial date has been
    set in either case. We believe that Barr’s and Teva’s
    claims are without merit and we expect to prevail. However, it
    is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this
    litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we
    will prevail. An unfavorable outcome

-66-

could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results
    of operations, liquidity, and financial position.

•

Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sicor), a subsidiary of Teva,
    submitted ANDAs in November 2005 seeking permission to market
    generic versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our
    relevant U.S. patents (expiring in 2010 and 2013), and
    alleging that these patents are invalid. In February 2006, we
    filed a lawsuit against Sicor in the U.S. District Court
    for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that
    these patents are valid and are being infringed by Sicor. In
    response to our lawsuit, Sicor filed a declaratory judgment
    action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District
    of California. Sicor also moved to dismiss our lawsuit in
    Indiana, asserting that the Indiana court lacks jurisdiction.
    The California action has been dismissed. In September 2006, we
    received notice that Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc. (Mayne) filed a
    similar ANDA for Gemzar. In October 2006, we filed a lawsuit
    against Mayne in the Southern District of Indiana in response to
    the ANDA filing. In response to our lawsuit, Mayne filed a
    motion to our lawsuit, asserting that the Indiana court lacks
    jurisdiction. In October 2006, we received notice that Sun
    Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) filed an ANDA for Gemzar,
    alleging that the 2013 patent is invalid. In December 2006, we
    filed a lawsuit against Sun in the Southern District of Indiana
    in response to Sun’s ANDA filing. We expect to prevail in
    litigation involving our Gemzar patents and believe that claims
    made by these generic companies that our patents are not valid
    are without merit. However, it is not possible to predict or
    determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we
    can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable
    outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
    results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.

In June 2002, we were sued by Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Whitehead Institute
    for Biomedical Research and the President and Fellows of Harvard
    College in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts alleging that sales of two of our products, Xigris
    and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related
    to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the
    human body, and seeking royalties on past and future sales of
    these products. In June 2005, the United States Patent and
    Trademark Office commenced a re-examination of the patent in
    order to consider certain issues raised by us relating to the
    validity of the patent. On May 4, 2006, a jury in Boston
    issued an initial decision in the case that Xigris and Evista
    sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the plaintiffs
    approximately $65 million in damages, calculated by
    applying a 2.3 percent royalty to all U.S. sales of
    Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent
    through the date of trial. We are seeking to have the jury
    verdict overturned by the trial court judge, and if
    unsuccessful, will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals
    for the Federal Circuit. In addition, a separate bench trial
    with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts was held the
    week of August 7, 2006, on our contention that the patent
    is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes. No
    decision has been rendered. We believe that these allegations
    are without legal merit, that we will ultimately prevail on
    these issues and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary
    damages is remote.

Government
    Investigations

In March 2004, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the
    Eastern District of Pennsylvania advised us that it had
    commenced a civil investigation related to our
    U.S. marketing and promotional practices, including our
    communications with physicians and remuneration of physician
    consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and
    Prozac Weekly. In October 2005, the U.S. Attorney’s
    Office advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding
    certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy
    benefit manager covering Axid, Evista, Humalog, Humulin, Prozac,
    and Zyprexa. The inquiry includes a review of Lilly’s
    Medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales
    covered by the rebate agreements. We are cooperating with the
    U.S. Attorney in these investigations, including providing
    a broad range of documents and information relating to the
    investigations. In June 2005, we received a subpoena from the
    Office of the Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, of
    the State of Florida, seeking production of documents relating
    to sales of Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices
    with respect to Zyprexa. In September 2006, we received a
    subpoena from the California Attorney General’s Office
    seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain
    and maintain Zyprexa’s status on California’s
    formulary, marketing

-67-

and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa, and
    remuneration of health care providers. Beginning in August 2006,
    we have received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from
    the attorneys general of a number of states. Most of these
    requests are now part of a multistate investigative effort being
    coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general. We
    are aware that 26 states are participating in this joint
    effort, and we anticipate that additional states will join the
    investigation. These attorneys general are seeking a broad range
    of Zyprexa documents, including documents relating to sales,
    marketing and promotional practices, and remuneration of health
    care providers. It is possible that other Lilly products could
    become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these
    matters could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or
    other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. We cannot predict or
    determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate
    the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that
    might result from an adverse outcome. It is possible, however,
    that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on
    our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial
    position. We have implemented and continue to review and enhance
    a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive
    compliance-related activities designed to ensure that our
    marketing and promotional practices, physician communications,
    remuneration of health care professionals, managed care
    arrangements, and Medicaid best price reporting comply with
    applicable laws and regulations.

Product
    Liability and Related Litigation

We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa
    product liability lawsuits in the United States and have been
    notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed
    suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the
    “claims”) allege a variety of injuries from the use of
    Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or
    contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims
    seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically
    accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side
    effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we
    improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits
    are part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding
    before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District
    Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596).

Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various
    claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product
    liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the
    claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 28,500
    claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits
    and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as
    follows:

•

In June 2005, we reached an agreement in principle (and in
    September 2005 a final agreement) to settle more than 8,000
    claims for $690.0 million plus $10.0 million to cover
    administration of the settlement. That settlement is being
    administered by special settlement masters appointed by Judge
    Weinstein.

•

In January 2007, we reached agreements with a number of
    plaintiffs’ attorneys to settle more than 18,000 claims for
    approximately $500 million.

The 2005 settlement totaling $700.0 million was paid during
    2005. The January 2007 settlements were recorded in other
    current liabilities in our December 31, 2006 consolidated
    balance sheet and will be paid in the first quarter of 2007.

The U.S. Zyprexa product liability claims not subject to
    these agreements include approximately 340 lawsuits in the
    U.S. covering approximately 900 claimants and an additional
    400 claims of which we are aware. In addition, we have been
    served with a lawsuit seeking class certification in which the
    members of the purported class are seeking refunds and medical
    monitoring. In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits
    seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of patients who
    took Zyprexa. One of these four lawsuits has been certified for
    residents of Quebec. The allegations in the Canadian actions are
    similar to those in the litigation pending in the U.S.

We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in
    all remaining cases. We currently anticipate that trials in
    seven cases in the Eastern District of New York will begin in
    the second quarter of 2007.

We have insurance coverage for a portion of our Zyprexa product
    liability claims exposure. The third-party insurance carriers
    have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and
    are seeking to rescind the

-68-

policies. The dispute is now the subject of litigation in the
    federal court in Indianapolis against certain of the carriers
    and in arbitration in Bermuda against other carriers. While we
    believe our position has merit, there can be no assurance that
    we will prevail.

In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other
    product liability lawsuits involving primarily
    diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thimerosal. The majority of these
    claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and
    coverage limits.

In the second quarter of 2005, we recorded a net pretax charge
    of $1.07 billion for product liability matters. The charge
    took into account our estimated recoveries from our insurance
    coverage related to these matters. The charge covered the
    following:

•

The cost of the June 2005 Zyprexa settlements described
    above; and

•

Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs
    regarding the then-known and expected product liability claims
    to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the
    probable number and cost of the claims. A substantial majority
    of those exposures and costs were related to then-known and
    expected Zyprexa claims.

As a result of the January 2007 settlements discussed above, we
    incurred a pretax charge of $494.9 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2006. The charge covered the following:

•

The cost of the January 2007 Zyprexa settlements; and

•

Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs
    regarding the then-known and expected Zyprexa product liability
    claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of
    the probable number and cost of the claims.

In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in
    state court in Louisiana on behalf of the Louisiana Department
    of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or
    contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that
    we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have been removed
    to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the
    Eastern District of New York. In these actions, the Department
    of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for
    Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as
    well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and
    will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. In 2006, we were
    served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, West
    Virginia, New Mexico, and Mississippi in the courts of the
    respective states.

In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New
    York purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all
    consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental
    entities, which have made or will make payments for their
    members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These
    actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which
    is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the
    federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a
    refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages,
    and attorneys’ fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in
    the Eastern District of New York in 2006 on similar grounds. As
    with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we
    inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa
    and improperly promoted the drug.

We cannot predict with certainty the additional number of
    lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. In addition, although
    we believe it is probable, there can be no assurance that the
    January 2007 Zyprexa product liability settlements described
    above will be concluded. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa
    product liability and related litigation could have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
    liquidity, and financial position.

Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible
    that we could become subject to large numbers of product
    liability and related claims for other products in the future.
    In the past few years, we have experienced difficulties in
    obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive
    insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our
    currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we
    will continue to be largely self-insured for future product
    liability losses. In addition, as noted above, there is no
    assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our
    insurance carriers on past claims.

Environmental
    Matters

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
    and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, we have been
    designated as one of several potentially responsible parties
    with respect to fewer than 10 sites. Under Superfund, each
    responsible party may be jointly and severally liable for the
    entire amount of the cleanup. We also continue remediation of
    certain of our own sites. We have accrued for estimated
    Superfund cleanup costs, remediation, and certain other
    environmental matters. This takes into account, as applicable,
    available information regarding site conditions, potential
    cleanup methods, estimated costs, and the extent to which other
    parties can be expected to contribute to payment of those costs.
    We have reached a settlement with our liability insurance
    carriers providing for coverage for certain environmental
    liabilities.

    were not significant, as income taxes were not provided for
    foreign currency translation.

The unrealized gains (losses) on securities is net of
    reclassification adjustments of $16.9 million,
    $9.1 million, and $9.8 million, net of tax, in 2006,
    2005, and 2004, respectively, for net realized gains on sales of

    rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges.

Generally, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are
    translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange
    rate. For those operations, changes in exchange rates generally
    do not affect cash flows; therefore, resulting translation
    adjustments are made in shareholders’ equity rather than in
    income.

Management’s
    Reports

Management’s Report for Financial Statements —
    Eli Lilly and Company and Subsidiaries

Management of Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries is
    responsible for the accuracy, integrity, and fair presentation
    of the financial statements. The statements have been prepared
    in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
    the United States and include amounts based on judgments and
    estimates by management. In management’s opinion, the
    consolidated financial statements present fairly our financial
    position, results of operations, and cash flows.

In addition to the system of internal accounting controls, we
    maintain a code of conduct (known as

The Red Book

) that
    applies to all employees worldwide, requiring proper overall
    business conduct, avoidance of conflicts of interest, compliance
    with laws, and confidentiality of proprietary information.

The Red Book

is reviewed on a periodic basis with
    employees worldwide, and all employees are required to report
    suspected violations. A hotline number is published in

The
    Red Book

to enable employees to report suspected violations
    anonymously. Employees who report suspected violations are
    protected from discrimination or retaliation by the company. In
    addition to

The Red Book

, the CEO, the COO, and all
    financial management must sign a financial code of ethics, which
    further reinforces their fiduciary responsibilities.

The financial statements have been audited by Ernst &
    Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm.
    Their responsibility is to examine our consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Ernst & Young’s opinion with
    respect to the fairness of the presentation of the statements
    (see opinion on page 73) is included in our annual
    report. Ernst & Young reports directly to the audit
    committee of the board of directors.

Our audit committee includes four nonemployee members of the
    board of directors, all of whom are independent from our
    company. The committee charter, which is published in the proxy
    statement, outlines the members’ roles and responsibilities
    and is consistent with enacted corporate reform laws and
    regulations. It is the audit committee’s responsibility to
    appoint an independent registered public accounting firm subject
    to shareholder ratification, approve both audit and nonaudit
    services performed by the independent registered public
    accounting firm, and review the reports submitted by the firm.
    The audit committee meets several times during the year with
    management, the internal auditors, and the independent public
    accounting firm to discuss audit activities, internal controls,
    and financial reporting matters, including reviews of our
    externally published financial results. The internal auditors
    and the independent registered public accounting firm have full
    and free access to the committee.

We are dedicated to ensuring that we maintain the high standards
    of financial accounting and reporting that we have established.
    We are committed to providing financial information that is
    transparent, timely, complete, relevant, and accurate. Our
    culture demands integrity and an unyielding commitment to strong
    internal practices and policies. Finally, we have the highest
    confidence in our financial reporting, our underlying system of
    internal controls, and our people, who are objective in their
    responsibilities and operate under a code of conduct and the
    highest level of ethical standards.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting —
    Eli Lilly and Company and Subsidiaries

Management of Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We have global
    financial policies that govern critical areas, including
    internal controls, financial accounting and reporting, fiduciary
    accountability, and safeguarding of corporate assets. Our
    internal accounting control systems are designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that
    transactions are executed in accordance with management’s
    authorization and are properly recorded, and that accounting
    records are adequate for preparation of financial statements and
    other financial information. A staff of internal auditors
    regularly monitors, on a worldwide basis, the adequacy and
    effectiveness of internal accounting controls. The general
    auditor reports directly to the audit committee of the board of
    directors.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on our evaluation under this framework, we
    concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting
    were effective as of December 31, 2006. However, because of
    its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
    reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The internal control over financial reporting has been assessed
    by Ernst & Young LLP. Their responsibility is to
    evaluate management’s assessment and evidence about whether
    internal control over financial reporting was designed and
    operating effectively. Ernst & Young’s report with
    respect to the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting is included on page 55 of our annual report
    (page 74 of Form 10-K).

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Shareholders

Eli Lilly and Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries’
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
    report dated February 9, 2007 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements,
    in 2005 Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries adopted new
    accounting pronouncements for asset retirement obligations and
    stock-based compensation. As discussed in Note 12 to the
    financial statements, in 2006 Eli Lilly and Company and
    subsidiaries adopted a new accounting pronouncement for defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement plans.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Shareholders

Eli Lilly and Company

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Eli Lilly and Company and
    subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Eli Lilly and
    Company and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
    Also, in our opinion, Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    2006 consolidated financial statements of Eli Lilly and Company
    and subsidiaries and our report dated February 9, 2007,
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Item 9A.

Controls and
    Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

Under applicable SEC regulations, management of a reporting
    company, with the participation of the principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer, must periodically
    evaluate the company’s “disclosure controls and
    procedures,” which are defined generally as controls and
    other procedures of a reporting company designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed by the reporting company in
    its periodic reports filed with the commission (such as this

Form 10-K)

is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely
    basis.

Our management, with the participation of Sidney Taurel,
    chairman and chief executive officer, and Derica W. Rice,
    senior vice president and chief financial officer, evaluated our
    disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006,
    and concluded that they are effective.

Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting

Messrs. Taurel and Rice and Dr. John C. Lechleiter,
    president and chief operating officer, provided a report on
    behalf of management on our internal control over financial
    reporting, in which management concluded that the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting is effective at
    December 31, 2006. In addition, Ernst & Young LLP,
    the company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, provided an attestation report on management’s
    assessment of internal control over financial reporting. You can
    find the full text of management’s report and
    Ernst & Young’s attestation report in
    Part II, Item 8, and both reports are incorporated by
    reference in this Item.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

During the fourth quarter of 2006, there were no changes in our
    internal control over financial reporting that materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting.
