Part I

Item 1. Business

Eli Lilly and Company (the “Company” or “Registrant”, which may be referred to
as “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in 1901 in Indiana to succeed to the
drug manufacturing business founded in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1876 by
Colonel Eli Lilly. We discover, develop, manufacture, and sell products in one
significant business segment—pharmaceutical products. Operations of our animal
health business segment are not material to our financial statements. We
manufacture and distribute our products through owned or leased facilities in
the United States, Puerto Rico, and 26 other countries. Our products are sold
in approximately 160 countries.

Most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own
scientists, and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to
continue to discover and develop innovative new pharmaceutical products. We
direct our research efforts primarily toward the search for products to
diagnose, prevent and treat human diseases. We also conduct research to find
products to treat diseases in animals and to increase the efficiency of animal
food production.

Marketing

We sell most of our products worldwide. We adapt our marketing methods and
product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs.

Pharmaceuticals – United States

In the United States, we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through
approximately 35 independent wholesale distributors. Our marketing policy is
designed to assure that products and relevant medical information are
immediately available to physicians, pharmacies, hospitals, and appropriate
health care professionals throughout the country. Three wholesale distributors
in the United States – AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc.,
and McKesson Corporation – each accounted for between 19 and 23 percent of our
consolidated net sales in 2001. No other distributor accounted for more than
10 percent of consolidated net sales. We also sell pharmaceutical products
directly to the United States government and other manufacturers, but those
sales are not material.

We promote our major pharmaceutical products in the United States through sales
representatives who call upon physicians, wholesalers, hospitals, managed-care
organizations, retail pharmacists, and other health care professionals. To
support our sales representatives’ efforts, we advertise in medical and drug
journals, distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians,
and exhibit at medical meetings. In addition, we advertise certain products
directly to consumers in the United States and we maintain Web sites with
information about all our major products. Divisions of our sales force are
dedicated to product lines or practice areas, such as primary care,
neuroscience, diabetes care, critical care, cardiovascular, endocrinology, and
oncology. We have entered into licensing arrangements under which other
companies market certain products manufactured by the Company, such as Axid,
Lorabid, and Permax.

Large purchasers of pharmaceuticals, such as managed-care groups and government
and long-term care institutions, account for a significant portion of total
pharmaceutical purchases in the United States. We have created special sales
groups to service managed-care organizations, government and long-term care
institutions, hospital contract administrators, and certain retail pharmacies.
In response to competitive pressures, we have entered into arrangements with a
number of these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more
Company products or other cost-sharing arrangements.

-2-

Pharmaceuticals – Outside the United States

Outside the United States, we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily
through sales representatives. While the products marketed vary from country
to country, neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total
sales. Distribution patterns vary from country to country. In most countries,
we maintain our own sales and distribution organizations. In some countries,
however, we market our products through independent distributors.

Animal Health Products

Our Elanco Animal Health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the
United States to market animal health products. Elanco also has an extensive
sales force outside the United States. Elanco sells its products primarily to
wholesale distributors.

Raw Materials and Product Supply

Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are
available from more than one source. We obtain certain raw materials
principally from only one source. In addition, three of our significant
products are manufactured by others: Actos by Takeda; ReoPro by Centocor; and
Xigris by Lonza Biologics (bulk product) and Catalytica, Inc. (finished
product). If we were unable to obtain certain materials from present sources,
we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources
or, in some cases, implemented alternative processes.

The majority of our sales abroad are of products manufactured wholly or in part
abroad. However, a principal source of active ingredients for those
manufactured products continues to be our facilities in the United States.

We seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and maintain
inventory in a way that will allow us to meet all expected product demand while
maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve
efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. However,
pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary
widely from product to product. Consequently, shifting or adding manufacturing
capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital
expenditures. Accordingly, if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns
or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand, we could experience an
interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until
production can be resumed or expanded.

Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights

Overview

Intellectual property protection is, in the aggregate, material to our ability
to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations. We own, have
applied for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents, both in the
United States and in other countries, relating to products, product uses,
formulations, and manufacturing processes. There is no assurance that the
patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been granted
would be found valid if challenged. Moreover, patents relating to particular
products, uses, formulations, or processes do not preclude other manufacturers
from employing alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or
formulations that might successfully compete with our patented products.

-3-

Outside the United States, the standard of intellectual property protection for
pharmaceuticals varies widely. While many countries have reasonably strong
patent laws, other countries currently provide little or no effective
protection for inventions or other intellectual property rights. Under the
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPs) administered
by the World Trade Organization (WTO), over 140 countries have now agreed to
provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to
assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners.
However, in many countries, this agreement will not become fully effective for
many years. It is possible that changes to this agreement will be made in the
future that will diminish or further delay its implementation in developing
countries. It is too soon to assess how much, if at all, we will benefit
commercially from these changes.

When a product patent expires, the patent holder often loses effective market
exclusivity for the product. This can result in very substantial reductions in
sales of the formerly patented product, particularly in the United States.
However, in some cases the innovator company can obtain additional commercial
benefits through manufacturing trade secrets; later-expiring patents on
processes, uses, or formulations; trademark use; or marketing exclusivity that
may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.

Our Intellectual Property Portfolio

We consider patent protection for certain products, processes, and
uses—particularly that relating to Zyprexa, Gemzar, Humalog, Evista, Actos,
ReoPro, Xigris and Axid—to be important to our operations. For many of our
products, in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on
manufacturing processes, formulations, or uses that may extend exclusivity
beyond the expiration of the product patent.

United States compound patent expirations include those claiming the respective
active ingredients in Axid, 2002; Zyprexa, 2011; Humalog, 2013; and ReoPro,
2015. The Gemzar compound patent in the U.S. expires in 2010, but a use patent
covering treatment of neoplasms with Gemzar is in force until 2012. We hold a
number of U.S. patents covering Evista and its approved uses in osteoporosis
prevention and treatment that we believe can provide us exclusivity in the
United States until at least 2012. We are in the process of extending the U.S.
compound patent on the active ingredient in Evista, but, even if extended, this
patent will expire substantially before 2012. In the United States, Actos will
be protected by a compound patent through the duration of our co-promotion
agreement, which runs until 2006. Xigris is a complex glycoprotein biologic
product that is produced through recombinant DNA technology. Xigris is not
subject to the Abbreviated New Drug Application process under the Hatch-Waxman
law as described below. In addition, we hold patents on the DNA materials,
certain uses, manufacturing process, and the glycoprotein itself. We believe
the intellectual property protection for Xigris should provide us marketing
exclusivity until at least 2015.

The United States compound patent covering Prozac expired in 2001. We hold
another patent for the method of use of Prozac’s active ingredient which
expires in December 2003, but the patent claim to that use was ruled invalid by
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Generic competition for
Prozac entered the U.S. market in August, 2001, resulting in a very rapid and
substantial decline in U.S. Prozac sales. Outside the United States, Prozac
patents generally either have expired or will expire over the next several
years.

Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider
in the aggregate to be important to our operations. Trademark protection
varies throughout the world, with protection continuing in some countries as
long as the mark is used, and in other countries as long as it is registered.
Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms.

Patent Challenges Under the Hatch-Waxman Act

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly
known as “Hatch-Waxman,” made a complex set of changes to both patent and
new-drug-approval laws in the United States. Before Hatch-Waxman, no drug
could be approved without providing the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)
complete safety and efficacy studies,

i.e.

, a complete New Drug Application
(“NDA”). Hatch-Waxman authorizes the FDA to approve generic versions of
innovative medicines without such information by filing an Abbreviated New Drug
Application (“ANDA”). In an ANDA, the generic manufacturer must demonstrate
only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the NDA-approved drug –
not safety and efficacy.

Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until
after the innovator’s patents expire. However, after the innovator has
marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA
alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s NDA are
invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a “Paragraph IV
certification.” The innovator must then file suit against the generic
manufacturer to protect its patents. If one or more of the NDA-listed patents
are successfully challenged, the first filer of a Paragraph IV certification
may be entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity over all other
generic manufacturers.

In recent years, generic manufacturers have used Paragraph IV certifications
extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals,
and we expect this trend to continue. For example, the loss of the 2003 patent
on Prozac described above was the result of a Paragraph IV patent challenge.
Also, in 2001 we successfully defeated a Paragraph IV challenge to our patents
covering Axid. In 2001, two generic drug manufacturers, Zenith Goldline
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Zenith”) and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (“Reddy”)
filed ANDAs challenging our Zyprexa patents under Paragraph IV certifications.
We filed separate suits against Zenith and Reddy seeking rulings that the
patent challenges are without merit. For more information on the Zyprexa
patent litigation, see Part 1, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.

Proposals have been introduced in Congress to amend various aspects of
Hatch-Waxman. In general, the proposals appear to be principally designed to
encourage more Paragraph IV challenges to innovator patents. We cannot predict
whether any changes will be made or what impact they would have on our
business.

Competition

Our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other
companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Our animal
health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of pharmaceutical,
chemical, and other companies that operate animal health divisions or
subsidiaries.

Important competitive factors include product efficacy, safety and ease of use,
price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, service,
and research and development of new products and processes. If competitors
introduce new products and processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our
products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of
sales, or both. New products that we introduce usually must compete with other
products already on the market or products that are later developed by
competitors. Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far
less in research and development than research-based pharmaceutical companies
and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded
products. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it
normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. In
many countries outside the United States, patent protection is weak or
nonexistent and we must compete

-5-

with generic or “knockoff” versions of our products. To successfully compete
for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations,
we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but
also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care.

We believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in
discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet
medical needs, together with our ability to manufacture the products
efficiently and to market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.
There can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will
result in commercially successful products or that our products or processes
will not become outmoded from time to time as a result of products or processes
developed by our competitors.

Government Regulation

Our operations are regulated extensively by the federal government, to some
extent by state governments, and in varying degrees by foreign governments.
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, other federal statutes and
regulations, various state statutes and regulations, and laws and regulations
of foreign governments govern to varying degrees the testing, approval,
production, labeling, distribution, post-market surveillance, advertising,
dissemination of information, and promotion of our products. The lengthy
process of laboratory and clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing
development, and regulatory review necessary for required governmental
approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions
in a given market. Promotion, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution of
pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated in all major world markets.
In addition, our operations are subject to complex federal, state, local, and
foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations. We
anticipate that the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of
current products and the introduction of new products will continue to require
substantial scientific and technical effort, time, and expense and significant
capital investment.

In the United States, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 requires us
to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of certain of our
products under state Medicaid programs. In addition, a model waiver program has
been created administratively that allows states to expand the Medicaid drug
benefit to include low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Other cost containment
measures have been adopted or proposed by federal, state, and local government
entities that provide or pay for health care. In most international markets,
we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost containment programs,
which may include price controls, discounts and rebates, restrictions on
physician prescription levels, restrictions on reimbursement, compulsory
licenses and generic substitution.

In the U.S., branded pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing
pressures, which could be significantly affected by the current national debate
over Medicare reform as well as by actions by individual states to reduce
pharmaceutical costs for Medicaid patients, seniors, and the uninsured and
underinsured. Many proposals now being considered at the federal and state
levels and, in some cases, implemented at the state level, would result in
government agencies demanding discounts and rebates from pharmaceutical
companies that may expressly or implicitly create price controls on
prescription drugs. For example, at the federal level, the administration has
proposed modifying the Medicaid rebate calculation. While this change requires
congressional action, it would lead to a significant increase in our Medicaid
rebate liability. At the state level, examples include Florida and Michigan,
which have begun to implement supplemental rebates and restricted formularies
in their Medicaid programs. While legal challenges to these and other state
programs have been mounted, it is unknown at this time if the courts will allow
them to continue.

International operations are also generally subject to extensive price and
market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional
cost-containment measures, including proposals that would directly or
indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our
intellectual property protection.

-6-

We cannot predict whether such proposals will be adopted or the extent to which
our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or
regulatory developments. However, we expect that pressures on pharmaceutical
pricing will continue and likely intensify in the near term.

Research and Development

Our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years. Our
research and development activities are responsible for the discovery or
development of most of the products we offer today. We invest heavily in
research and development because we believe it is critical to our long-term
competitiveness. At the end of 2001, we employed approximately 7,600 people in
pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities, including
a substantial number of physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate
degrees, and highly skilled technical personnel. We expended $1.78 billion on
research and development activities in 1999, $2.02 billion in 2000, and $2.24
billion in 2001.

We concentrate our pharmaceutical research and development efforts in six
therapeutic categories: central nervous system and related diseases; endocrine
diseases, including diabetes and osteoporosis; cancer; cardiovascular diseases;
infectious diseases; and inflammation. However, we remain opportunistic;
therefore, we selectively pursue promising leads in other therapeutic areas.
We are actively engaged in biotechnology research programs involving
recombinant DNA, proteins, and genomics (the development of therapeutics
through identification of disease-causing genes and their cellular function).
In addition to discovering and developing new chemical entities, we look for
ways to expand the value of existing products through new uses and formulations
that can provide additional benefits to patients.

To supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with independent research
organizations, including educational institutions and research-based
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and we contract with others for the
performance of research in their facilities. We use the services of
physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and other research organizations
worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness
of new products. We actively seek out investments in external research and
technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own
research efforts. These investments can take many forms, including licensing
arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, co-promotion
arrangements, joint ventures, and acquisitions.

We also conduct extensive work in the animal sciences, including animal
nutrition and physiology and veterinary medicine. Certain of our research and
development activities relating to pharmaceutical products may be applicable to
animal health products. An example is the search for agents that will cure
infectious disease.

Drug development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. On average, only one
out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to
be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine. The
process from discovery to regulatory approval can take more than twelve years.
Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even late-stage
product candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval. We believe
our investments in research, both internally and in collaboration with others,
have been rewarded by the number of new pharmaceutical compounds and
indications in all stages of development. Among our new investigational
compounds in the later stages of development are potential therapies for
osteoporosis, male erectile dysfunction, depression, attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, various cancers, stress urinary incontinence,
diabetic complications, and genital herpes. Further, we are studying many other drug
candidates in the earlier stages of development.

-7-

We are also developing new uses and formulations for many of our important
products, such as Zyprexa, Gemzar, ReoPro, and Evista.

Quality Assurance

Our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of
our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and
effectiveness. Product quality arises from the total commitment to quality in
all parts of our operations, including research and development, purchasing,
facilities planning, manufacturing, and distribution. We have developed
quality-assurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of
scientific information and production processes.

Control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients,
equipment, facilities, manufacturing methods, packaging materials, and
labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes and on
the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements
and our standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical chemical
analyses, microbiological testing, testing in animals, or a combination.
Additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate quality-assurance
group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing
procedures and systems in the parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates, and
third-party suppliers.

As a result of plant inspections in early 2001, the FDA informed us of a number
of observations and issued a warning letter regarding our adherence to current
Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). In response, we have been implementing
comprehensive, companywide improvements in our manufacturing operations. In
November 2001, following a reinspection of the manufacturing facilities, the
FDA noted additional observations, primarily relating to computer system
validation, manufacturing process reviews, and data handling. We have
responded to the FDA relative to these observations and have met with agency
officials to discuss our plans to address the issues raised. Approval of new
products will depend on resolution of all manufacturing issues to the agency’s
satisfaction. The timeline for resolution of these issues is difficult to
predict. A manufacturer subject to a warning letter that fails to correct cGMP
deficiencies to the agency’s satisfaction could be subject to interruption of
production, delays in NDA approvals, recalls, seizures, fines, and other
penalties. If we were to experience an extended delay in new-product approvals
because of these regulatory issues, it could have a material adverse effect on
our consolidated results of operations but would be unlikely to have a material
adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.

Executive Officers of the Company

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive
officers. All executive officers have been employed by the Company in
executive positions during the last five years.

The term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual
meeting of the Board of Directors, to be held on April 15, 2002, or on the date
his or her successor is chosen and qualified. No director or executive officer
of the Company has a “family relationship” with any other director or executive
officer of the Company, as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure
requirement. There is no understanding between any executive officer and any
other person pursuant to which the executive officer was selected.

Employees

At the end of 2001, we employed approximately 41,100 people, including
approximately 19,100 employees outside the United States. A substantial number
of our employees have long records of continuous service.

Financial Information Relating to Business Segments and Classes of Products

You can find financial information relating to our business segments and
classes of products in our 2001 Annual Report at page 31 under “Segment
Information” (page 14 of Exhibit 13 to this Form
10-K). That information is incorporated into this Report by reference.

The relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated net
sales changes from year to year. In addition, the contribution of any
particular product to net income is not necessarily the same as its
contribution to consolidated net sales. This is due to several factors,
including the introduction of new products by us and by other manufacturers.

Financial Information Relating to Foreign and Domestic Operations

You can find financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations
in our 2001 Annual Report at page 31 under “Segment Information” (page 14 of Exhibit 13). That information is incorporated in this Report by reference.

To date, our overall operations abroad have not been significantly deterred by
local restrictions on the transfer of funds from branches and subsidiaries
located abroad, including the availability of dollar exchange. We cannot
predict what effect these restrictions or the other risks inherent in foreign
operations, including possible nationalization, might have on our future
operations or what other restrictions may be imposed in the future. In
addition, changing currency values can either favorably or

-9-

unfavorably affect our financial position and results of operations. We
actively manage foreign exchange risk through various hedging techniques
including the use of foreign currency contracts.

Item 2. Properties

Our principal domestic and international executive offices are located in
Indianapolis. At December 31, 2001, we owned 13 production and distribution
facilities in the United States and Puerto Rico. Together with the corporate
administrative offices, these facilities contain an aggregate of approximately
9.7 million square feet of floor area dedicated to production, distribution,
and administration. Major production sites include Indianapolis; Clinton and
Lafayette, Indiana; and Carolina and Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. We also lease
sales offices in a number of cities located in the United States and abroad.

We own production and distribution facilities in 17 countries outside the
United States and Puerto Rico, containing an aggregate of approximately 4.3
million square feet of floor space. Major production sites include facilities
in the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Spain, Brazil, Italy, and Mexico. We
lease production and warehouse facilities in Puerto Rico and several countries
outside the United States.

Our research and development facilities in the United States consist of
approximately 4.0 million square feet and are located primarily in Indianapolis
and Greenfield, Indiana. Our major research and development facilities abroad
are located in Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Spain and contain
an aggregate of approximately 612,000 square feet.

We believe that none of our properties is subject to any encumbrance, easement,
or other restriction that would detract materially from its value or impair its
use in the operation of the business. The buildings we own are of varying ages
and in good condition.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Zyprexa Patent Litigation

In February 2001, we were notified that Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(“Zenith”) had submitted an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) seeking
permission to market a generic version of Zyprexa in various dosage forms
several years prior to the expiration of our U.S. patents for the product,
alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed. On April 2, 2001, we
filed suit against Zenith in federal district court in Indianapolis seeking a
ruling that Zenith’s challenge to the U.S. compound patent (expiring in 2011)
is without merit. In May 2001, we were notified that Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories,
Ltd. (“Reddy”) had also filed an ANDA covering two dosage forms, alleging that
the patents are invalid or not infringed. On June 26, 2001, we filed a similar
patent infringement suit against Reddy in federal district court in
Indianapolis. Thereafter, in January 2002, Reddy filed an ANDA for
additional dosage forms and in February 2002, we filed an
infringement suit in the same court based on Reddy’s later ANDA. The cases are in the preliminary stages. We believe that the
generic manufacturers’ patent claims are without merit and we expect to prevail
in this litigation. However, it is not possible to predict or determine the
outcome of this litigation and accordingly there can be no assurance that we
will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on
our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.

Prozac Patent Litigation

Beginning in 1995, several generic manufacturers filed ANDAs for generic forms
of Prozac in various dosage forms, challenging our U.S. patents. Beginning in
1996, we filed suit against those manufacturers seeking rulings that our
patents are valid and enforceable. On May 30, 2001, the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit held that our method of use patent, expiring in late 2003,
was invalid. Thereafter, generic fluoxetine entered the U.S. market in early
August 2001, resulting in a very rapid and substantial

-10-

decline in Prozac sales. On October 16, 2001, we filed a petition for a writ
of certiorari seeking review of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. On
January 14, 2002, our petition was denied, bringing the litigation to an end.

Other Matters

We are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability litigation
lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (“DES”) and Prozac. In
approximately 115 actions, including several with multiple claimants,
plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of children or grandchildren of
women who ingested DES during pregnancy. In another approximately 15 actions,
plaintiffs seek to recover damages as a result of the ingestion of Prozac.

In March 1996, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) commenced a non-public
antitrust investigation focusing on the pharmaceutical industry practice of
providing discounts or rebates to managed-care organizations and certain other
purchasers. We have responded to two subpoenas from the FTC requesting
production of certain documents and other discovery responses. We believe that
all of our actions have been lawful and proper and are cooperating with the
investigation.

The FTC has instituted an industrywide study into what it describes as “the use
of agreements between and among pharmaceutical companies, and any other
strategies, that may delay generic drug competition throughout the United
States since January 1, 1991.” In April 2001, we received an order from the
FTC for the production of documents and other information in connection with
the agency’s investigation. The FTC has indicated that orders are being issued
to approximately 100 pharmaceutical companies. We are cooperating with the
agency and we believe that all of our actions have been lawful and proper.

In March 2001, we received a subpoena, issued at the request of the
Commonwealth’s attorney for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for production
of documents related to pricing and Medicaid reimbursement of our products in
Massachusetts. We believe that we are not the only pharmaceutical company to
receive such a request. We are cooperating with the inquiry and we believe
that all of our practices have been lawful and proper.

In December 2001, we were named as a defendant along with many other
pharmaceutical manufacturers in a lawsuit in federal district court for the
district of Massachusetts that purports to be nationwide class action on behalf
of consumers of certain prescription drugs. The suit claims in general that as
a result of alleged improprieties in the manufacturers’ calculation and
reporting of average wholesale prices for purposes of Medicare reimbursement,
the consumers overpaid their portion of the cost of the drugs. In February
2002, we were named as a defendant along with many other manufacturers in a
similar suit brought in state court in Montana by the attorney general of
Montana on behalf of consumers of certain prescription drugs in that state. We
believe that all of our practices in this regard have been lawful and proper
and that these suits are without merit.

We are also a defendant in other litigation, including product liability and
patent suits, of a character we regard as normal to our business.

While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal
actions and investigations pending against us, we believe that except as
referred to above with respect to the Zyprexa patent litigation, the costs
associated with all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to
our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period.
