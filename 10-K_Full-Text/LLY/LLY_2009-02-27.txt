Part I

Item 1.

Business

Eli Lilly and Company (the “Company” or
    “Registrant”, which may be referred to as
    “we”, “us”, or “our”) was
    incorporated in 1901 in Indiana to succeed to the drug
    manufacturing business founded in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1876
    by Colonel Eli Lilly. We discover, develop, manufacture, and
    sell products in one significant business segment −
    pharmaceutical products. We also have an animal health business
    segment, whose operations are not material to our financial
    statements. We manufacture and distribute our products through
    owned or leased facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico,
    and 25 other countries. Our products are sold in approximately
    135 countries.

Most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed
    by our own scientists, and our success depends to a great extent
    on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative
    new pharmaceutical products. We direct our research efforts
    primarily toward the search for products to prevent and treat
    human diseases. We also conduct research to find products to
    treat diseases in animals and to increase the efficiency of
    animal food production.

Marketing

We sell most of our products worldwide. We adapt our marketing
    methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local
    needs.

-2-

Pharmaceuticals −
    United States

In the United States, we distribute pharmaceutical products
    principally through independent wholesale distributors, with
    some sales directly to pharmacies. Our marketing policy is
    designed to assure that products and relevant medical
    information are immediately available to physicians, pharmacies,
    hospitals, public and private payers, and appropriate health
    care professionals throughout the country. Three wholesale
    distributors in the United States − AmerisourceBergen
    Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and McKesson Corporation
    − each accounted for between 12 and 16 percent
    of our worldwide consolidated net sales in 2008. No other
    distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of
    consolidated net sales. We also sell pharmaceutical products
    directly to the United States government and other
    manufacturers, but those sales are not material.

We promote our major pharmaceutical products in the United
    States through sales representatives who call upon physicians
    and other health care professionals. We advertise in medical and
    drug journals, distribute literature and samples of certain
    products to physicians, and exhibit at medical meetings. In
    addition, we advertise certain products directly to consumers in
    the United States and we maintain web sites with information
    about all our major products. Divisions of our sales force are
    assigned to therapeutic areas, such as neuroscience, diabetes,
    osteoporosis, and oncology. We supplement our employee sales
    force with contract sales organizations as appropriate to
    leverage our own resources and the strengths of our partners in
    various markets.

Large purchasers of pharmaceuticals, such as managed-care
    groups, government agencies, and long-term care institutions,
    account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical
    purchases in the United States. We maintain special business
    groups to service wholesalers, managed-care organizations,
    government and long-term care institutions, hospitals, and
    certain retail pharmacies. In response to competitive pressures,
    we have entered into arrangements with a number of these
    organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more
    Lilly products.

Pharmaceuticals −
    Outside the United States

Outside the United States, we promote our pharmaceutical
    products primarily through sales representatives. While the
    products marketed vary from country to country, neuroscience
    products constitute the largest single group in total sales.
    Distribution patterns vary from country to country. In most
    countries, we maintain our own sales organizations. In some
    countries, however, we market our products through independent
    distributors.

Pharmaceutical
    Marketing Collaborations

We market certain of our significant products in collaboration
    with other pharmaceutical companies:

•

Cymbalta is co-promoted in the United States by Quintiles
    Transnational Corp. and is co-promoted or co-marketed outside
    the U.S. (except Japan) by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH.

•

Evista is marketed in major European markets by Daiichi Sankyo
    Europe GmbH, a subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. of Japan.

•

We co-promote Byetta with Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the
    United States and Puerto Rico, and we have exclusive marketing
    rights in other territories.

•

Erbitux is marketed in North America by Bristol-Myers Squibb. We
    co-promote Erbitux in North America. Outside North America,
    Erbitux is commercialized by Merck KGaA. We receive royalties
    from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck KGaA.

•

Efient will be

co-promoted

with us in major European markets by Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH.
    Assuming regulatory approvals, Daiichi Sankyo will also

co-promote

the product with us in the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China
    and several other Asian countries. Daiichi Sanko retains sole
    marketing rights in Japan, and we retain sole marketing rights
    in Canada, Australia, Russia and certain other
    countries.

Animal
    Health Products

Our Elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople
    throughout the United States to market animal health products.
    Elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the United
    States. Elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale
    distributors.

Competition

Our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured
    by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout
    the world. Our animal health products compete on a worldwide
    basis with products of animal health care companies as well as
    pharmaceutical, chemical, and other companies that operate
    animal health divisions or subsidiaries.

Important competitive factors include product efficacy, safety,
    and ease of use, price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness,
    marketing effectiveness, service, and research and development
    of new products and processes. If competitors introduce new
    products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost
    advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price
    reductions, decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new
    products that we introduce must compete with other products
    already on the market or products that are later developed by
    competitors. Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals invest far
    less in research and development than research-based
    pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products
    significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a
    branded pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity, it normally
    faces intense price competition from generic forms of the
    product. In many countries outside the United States, patent
    protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with
    generic versions of our products. Increasingly, to obtain
    favorable reimbursement and formulary positioning with
    government payers, managed care and pharmacy benefits management
    organizations, we must demonstrate that our products offer not
    only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with
    other forms of care.

We believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our
    success in discovering and developing (either alone or in
    collaboration with others) innovative, cost-effective products
    that serve unmet medical needs, together with our ability to
    continuously improve the productivity of our discovery,
    development, manufacturing, marketing and support operations in
    a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance that
    our research and development efforts will result in commercially
    successful products or that our products or processes will not
    become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products
    or processes developed by our competitors.

Patents,
    Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights

Overview

Intellectual property protection is, in the aggregate, material
    to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences
    innovations. We own, have applied for, or are licensed under, a
    large number of patents, both in the United States and in other
    countries, relating to products, product uses, formulations, and
    manufacturing processes. There is no assurance that the patents
    we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been
    granted would be found valid and enforceable if challenged.
    Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses,
    formulations, or processes do not preclude other manufacturers
    from employing alternative processes or from marketing
    alternative products or formulations that might successfully
    compete with our patented products. In addition, from time to
    time, competitors or other third parties assert claims that our
    activities infringe patents or other intellectual property
    rights held by them, or allege a third-party right of ownership
    in our existing intellectual property.

Outside the United States, the adequacy and effectiveness of
    intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies
    widely. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
    Agreement (TRIPs) administered by the World Trade Organization
    (WTO), over 140 countries have now agreed to provide
    non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions
    and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available
    to all patent owners. Because of TRIPs transition provisions,
    dispute resolution mechanisms, and substantive

-4-

limitations, it is still too soon to assess when and how much,
    if at all, we will benefit commercially from these changes.

When a product patent expires, the patent holder often loses
    effective market exclusivity for the product. This can result in
    a severe and rapid decline in sales of the formerly patented
    product, particularly in the United States. However, in
    some cases the innovator company may achieve exclusivity beyond
    the expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade
    secrets, later-expiring patents on methods of use or
    formulations, or data-based exclusivity that may be available
    under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.

Some of our products, including Erbitux, Forteo, ReoPro, and
    Xigris, are biological products, or biologics. Additionally,
    many of the potential products in our research pipeline are
    biologics. Currently, generic versions of biologics cannot be
    approved under U.S. law. Competitors seeking approval of
    biologics must file their own safety and efficacy data, and
    address the challenges of biologics manufacturing, which
    involves more complex and costly processes than those of
    traditional pharmaceutical operations. However, the law could
    change in the future to allow generic biologics. Even in the
    absence of new legislation, the U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) is taking steps toward allowing generic
    versions of certain biologics.

Our
    Intellectual Property Portfolio

We consider intellectual property protection for certain
    products, processes, and uses − particularly those
    products discussed below − to be important to our
    operations. For many of our products, in addition to the
    compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing
    processes, formulations, or uses that may extend exclusivity
    beyond the expiration of the product patent.

The most relevant U.S. patent protection, together with
    expected expiration, for our major marketed products is as
    follows:

•

Alimta

is protected by a compound patent (2016).

•

Byetta

is protected by a patent covering its use in
    treating type 2 diabetes (2017).

•

Cialis

is protected by compound and use patents (2017).

•

Cymbalta

is protected by a compound patent (2013).

•

Evista

is protected by patents on the treatment and
    prevention of osteoporosis (2012 and 2014), and its dosage form
    (2017). Evista for use in breast cancer risk reduction is
    protected by orphan drug exclusivity (2014).

•

Gemzar

is protected by a compound patent (2010) and
    a patent covering its antineoplastic use (2013).

•

Humalog

is protected by a compound patent (2013).

•

Strattera

is protected by a patent covering its use in
    treating attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (2016).

•

Zyprexa

is protected by a compound patent (2011).

Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks
    that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our
    operations. Trademark protection varies throughout the world,
    with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark
    is used, and in other countries as long as it is registered.
    Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms.

Patent
    Licenses

Most of our important products were discovered in our own
    laboratories and are not subject to significant license
    agreements. Two of our larger products, Cialis and Alimta, are
    subject to patent assignments or licenses granted to us by
    others.

•

The compound patent for Cialis is the subject of a license
    agreement with Glaxo SmithKline which assigns to us exclusively
    all rights in the compound. The agreement calls for royalties of
    a single-digit percentage

-5-

of net sales. The agreement is not subject to termination by
    Glaxo for any reason other than a material breach by Lilly of
    the royalty obligation, after a substantial cure period.

•

The compound patent for Alimta is the subject of a license
    agreement with Princeton University, granting us an irrevocable
    exclusive worldwide license to the compound patents for the
    lives of the patents in the respective territories. The
    agreement calls for royalties of a single-digit percentage of
    net sales. The agreement is not subject to termination by
    Princeton for any reason other than a material breach by Lilly
    of the royalty obligation, after a substantial cure period.
    Alimta is also the subject of a worldwide, nonexclusive license
    to certain compound and process patents owned by Takeda
    Pharmaceutical Company Limited. The agreement calls for
    royalties of a single-digit percentage of net sales in countries
    covered by a relevant patent. The agreement is subject to
    termination for material default and failure to cure by Lilly
    and in the event that Lilly becomes bankrupt or insolvent.

Patent
    Challenges

In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term
    Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as
    “Hatch-Waxman,” made a complex set of changes to both
    patent and new-drug-approval laws. Before Hatch-Waxman, no drug
    could be approved without providing the FDA complete safety and
    efficacy studies,

i.e.

, a complete New Drug Application
    (NDA). Hatch-Waxman authorizes the FDA to approve generic
    versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than biologics)
    without such information by filing an Abbreviated New Drug
    Application (ANDA). In an ANDA, the generic manufacturer must
    demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic
    version and the NDA-approved drug − not safety and
    efficacy.

Absent a patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until
    after the innovator’s patents expire. However, after the
    innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic
    manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that one or more of the
    patents listed in the innovator’s NDA are invalid or not
    infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a
    “Paragraph IV certification.” The innovator must
    then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its
    patents. The FDA is then prohibited from approving the generic
    company’s application for a 30- to

42-month

period (which can be shortened or extended by the trial court
    judge hearing the patent challenge). If one or more of the
    NDA-listed patents are challenged, the first filer of a
    Paragraph IV certification may be entitled to a

180-day

period of market exclusivity over all other generic
    manufacturers.

In recent years, generic manufacturers have used
    Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge
    patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals, and we
    expect this trend to continue. In addition, generic companies
    have shown an increasing willingness to launch “at
    risk,” i.e., after receiving ANDA approval but before final
    resolution of their patent challenge. We are currently in
    litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from
    their Paragraph IV certifications on Alimta, Cymbalta,
    Evista, Gemzar, and Strattera. For more information on these,
    see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis − Legal and Regulatory
    Matters.”

Outside the United States, the legal doctrines and processes by
    which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely. In
    recent years, we have experienced an increase in patent
    challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside
    the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. For
    more information on significant patent challenges outside the
    United States, see Part II, Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis −
    Legal and Regulatory Matters.”

Government
    Regulation

Regulation
    of Our Operations

Our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national,
    state and local agencies. The lengthy process of laboratory and
    clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing development, and
    regulatory review necessary for required governmental approvals
    is extremely costly and can significantly delay product
    introductions in a given market. Promotion, marketing,
    manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical and animal
    health products are extensively regulated in all major world
    markets. We are required to conduct extensive post-marketing
    surveillance of the safety of the products we sell. In addition,
    our operations are subject to complex

-6-

federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations
    concerning the environment, occupational health and safety, and
    privacy. The laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and
    sale of current products and the discovery, development and
    introduction of new products will continue to require
    substantial scientific and technical effort, time, and expense
    and significant capital investment.

Of particular importance is the FDA in the United States.
    Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA
    has jurisdiction over all of our products and administers
    requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness,
    manufacturing, quality control, distribution, labeling,
    marketing, advertising, dissemination of information and
    post-marketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products. The
    FDA, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),
    also regulates our animal health products. The
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also regulates some
    animal health products. In 2007, Congress passed the Food and
    Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA) of 2007, which
    imposes additional requirements for drug development and
    commercialization and provides the FDA with further authorities
    and resources, particularly in the area of drug safety.

The FDA extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing
    quality under its current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)
    regulations. In recent years, we have made, and we continue to
    make, substantial investments of capital and operating expenses
    to implement comprehensive, company-wide improvements in our
    manufacturing, product and process development, and quality
    operations to ensure sustained cGMP compliance. However, in the
    event we fail to adhere to cGMP requirements in the future, we
    could be subject to interruptions in production, fines and
    penalties, and delays in new product approvals.

Outside the United States, our products and operations are
    subject to similar regulatory requirements, notably by the
    European Medicines Agency (EMEA) in the European Union and the
    Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan. Specific
    regulatory requirements vary from country to country.

The marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of
    pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which
    manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers, are
    subject to various other federal and state laws, including the
    federal anti-kickback statute and the False Claims Act and state
    laws governing kickbacks, false claims, unfair trade practices,
    and consumer protection. These laws are administered by, among
    others, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector
    General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the
    Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Personnel Management and
    state attorneys general. Over the past several years, the FDA,
    the Department of Justice, and many of these other agencies have
    increased their enforcement activities with respect to
    pharmaceutical companies and increased the inter-agency
    coordination of enforcement activities. Over this period,
    several claims brought by these agencies against Lilly and other
    companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate
    criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements. See
    Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” and
    Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis − Legal and Regulatory
    Matters,” for information about currently pending and
    recently resolved marketing and promotional practices
    investigations involving Lilly, including information regarding
    a Corporate Integrity Agreement entered into by Lilly in
    connection with the resolution of a U.S. federal marketing
    practices investigation and certain related state investigations
    involving Zyprexa.

It is possible that we could become subject to additional
    administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could
    include claims for civil penalties (including treble damages
    under the False Claims Act), criminal sanctions, and
    administrative remedies, including exclusion from federal health
    care programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in pending
    or future actions could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial
    position.

Regulations
    Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement

In the United States, we are required to provide rebates to
    state governments on their purchases of certain of our products
    under state Medicaid programs. Other cost containment measures
    have been adopted or proposed by federal, state, and local
    government entities that provide or pay for health care. In most
    international markets, we operate in an environment of
    government-mandated cost containment programs, which may include
    price controls, reference pricing, discounts and rebates,
    restrictions on physician prescription levels, restrictions on
    reimbursement, compulsory licenses, health economic assessments,
    and generic substitution.

In the U.S., the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
    Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), took effect in 2006, providing
    a prescription drug benefit for seniors under the Medicare
    program, known as Medicare Part D. Pricing to manufacturers
    for drugs covered by the program is currently established
    through competitive negotiations between the manufacturers and
    private payers. However, various measures have been proposed
    that would allow or require the federal government to negotiate
    Medicare Part D drug prices directly with manufacturers. In
    addition, various proposals have been introduced that would
    increase the rebates we pay to the government. See Part II,
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis − Executive Overview − Legal,
    Regulatory, and Other Matters,” for more discussion of MMA
    and other federal healthcare cost containment measures. At the
    state level, budget pressures are causing various states to
    impose cost-control measures such as higher rebates and more
    restrictive formularies.

International operations are also generally subject to extensive
    price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for
    additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that
    would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls,
    limit access to or reimbursement for our products, or reduce the
    value of our intellectual property protection.

We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be
    affected by these or other potential future legislative or
    regulatory developments. However, we expect that pressures on
    pharmaceutical pricing will become more severe.

Research
    and Development

Our commitment to research and development dates back more than
    100 years. Our research and development activities are
    responsible for the discovery and development of most of the
    products we offer today. We invest heavily in research and
    development because we believe it is critical to our long-term
    competitiveness. At the end of 2008, we employed approximately
    8,600 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research
    and development activities, including a substantial number of
    physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees,
    and highly skilled technical personnel. Our research and
    development expenses were $3.13 billion in 2006,
    $3.49 billion in 2007, and $3.84 billion in 2008.

Our pharmaceutical research and development focuses on four
    therapeutic categories: central nervous system and related
    diseases; endocrine diseases, including diabetes, obesity and
    musculoskeletal disorders; cancer; and cardiovascular diseases.
    However, we remain opportunistic, selectively pursuing promising
    leads in other therapeutic areas. We are actively engaged in a
    strong biotechnology research program including therapeutic
    proteins, antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides as well as
    genomics (the development of therapeutics through identification
    of disease-causing genes and their cellular function),
    biomarkers, and targeted therapeutics. In addition to
    discovering and developing new chemical entities, we look for
    ways to expand the value of existing products through new uses,
    formulations and therapeutic approaches that can provide
    additional benefits to patients. We also conduct research in
    animal health, including animal nutrition and physiology,
    control of parasites, and veterinary medicine (both food and
    companion animal).

To supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others,
    including educational institutions and research-based
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and we contract with
    others for the performance of research in their facilities. We
    use the services of physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and
    other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical
    trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our
    products. We actively seek out investments in external research
    and technologies that hold the promise to complement and
    strengthen our own research efforts. These investments can take
    many forms, including licensing arrangements, co-development and
    co-marketing agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint
    ventures, and acquisitions.

Drug development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. On
    average, only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds
    discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective
    and safe enough to become an approved medicine. The process from
    discovery to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or
    longer. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process,
    and even late-stage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive
    regulatory approval or commercial success. Even after approval
    and launch of a product, we expend considerable resources on
    post-marketing surveillance and clinical studies. We believe our
    investments in research, both internally and in collaboration
    with others, have been rewarded by the number of new

-8-

compounds and new indications for existing compounds that we
    have in all stages of development. Among our new investigational
    compounds in the later stages of development are potential
    therapies for acute coronary syndromes, diabetes, osteoporosis,
    and cancer. Further, we are studying many other drug candidates
    in the earlier stages of development, including compounds
    targeting cancers, diabetes, obesity, musculoskeletal disorders,
    lipid abnormalities, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia,
    multiple sclerosis, depression, sleep disorders, pain and
    migraine, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
    alcoholism, and autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid
    arthritis. At present we have approximately 60 drug candidates
    across all stages of clinical development. We are also
    developing new uses and formulations for many of these compounds
    as well as our currently marketed products, such as Alimta,
    Byetta, Cialis, Cymbalta, Erbitux, Forteo, Gemzar, and Zyprexa.

Raw
    Materials and Product Supply

Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing
    operations are available from more than one source. We obtain
    certain raw materials principally from only one source. In
    addition, Byetta is manufactured by third-party suppliers to
    Amylin. In the event one of these suppliers was unable to
    provide the materials or product, we generally have sufficient
    inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of
    supply can be implemented. However, in the event of an extended
    failure of a supplier, it is possible that we could experience
    an interruption in supply until we established new sources or,
    in some cases, implemented alternative processes.

Our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at three sites in Indiana
    as well as locations in Ireland, Puerto Rico, and the United
    Kingdom. Finishing operations, including labeling and packaging,
    take place at a number of sites throughout the world.

We seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and
    maintain inventory in a way that will allow us to meet all
    expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to
    reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and
    respond to changes in supply and demand. However, pharmaceutical
    production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary
    widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing
    capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant
    capital expenditures and regulatory approvals. Accordingly, if
    we were to experience extended plant shutdowns or extraordinary
    unplanned increases in demand, we could experience an
    interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages
    until production could be resumed or expanded.

Quality
    Assurance

Our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in
    the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data
    that support their safety and effectiveness. Product quality
    arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our
    operations, including research and development, purchasing,
    facilities planning, manufacturing, and distribution. We have
    implemented quality-assurance procedures relating to the quality
    and integrity of scientific information and production processes.

Control of production processes involves rigid specifications
    for ingredients, equipment, facilities, manufacturing methods,
    packaging materials, and labeling. We perform tests at various
    stages of production processes and on the final product to
    assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and
    our standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical
    chemical analyses, microbiological testing, testing in animals,
    or a combination. Additional assurance of quality is provided by
    a corporate quality-assurance group that monitors existing
    pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and
    systems in the parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates, and
    third-party suppliers.

    number of our employees have long records of continuous service.

Financial
    Information Relating to Business Segments and Classes of
    Products

You can find financial information relating to our business
    segments and classes of products in Part II, Item 8 of
    this

Form 10-K,

“Segment Information.” That information is
    incorporated here by reference.

The relative contribution of any particular product to our
    consolidated net sales changes from year to year. This is due to
    several factors, including the introduction of new products by
    us and by other manufacturers and the introduction of generic
    pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations. In addition, margins
    vary for our different products due to various factors,
    including differences in the cost to manufacture and market the
    products, the value of the products to the marketplace, and
    government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement. Our major
    product sales are generally not seasonal.

Financial
    Information Relating to Foreign and Domestic
    Operations

You can find financial information relating to foreign and
    domestic operations in Part II, Item 8 of this

-10-

To date, our overall operations abroad have not been
    significantly deterred by local restrictions on the transfer of
    funds from branches and subsidiaries located abroad, including
    the availability of dollar exchange. We cannot predict what
    effect these restrictions or the other risks inherent in foreign
    operations, including possible nationalization, might have on
    our future operations or what other restrictions may be imposed
    in the future. In addition, changing currency values can either
    favorably or unfavorably affect our financial position and
    results of operations. We actively manage foreign exchange risk
    through various hedging techniques including the use of foreign
    currency contracts.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking
    Statements

In addition to the other information contained in this

Form 10-K,

the following risk factors should be considered carefully in
    evaluating our company. It is possible that our business,
    financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be
    materially adversely affected by any of these risks.

We have made certain forward-looking statements in this

Form 10-K,

and company spokespeople may make such statements in the future
    based on then-current expectations of management. Where
    possible, we try to identify forward-looking statements by using
    such words as “expect,” “plan,”
    “will,” “estimate,” “forecast,”
    “project,” “believe,”
    “anticipate,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking
    statements do not relate strictly to historical or current
    facts. They are likely to address our growth strategy, sales of
    current and anticipated products, financial results, the results
    of our research and development programs, the status of product
    approvals, and the outcome of contingencies such as litigation
    and investigations. All forward-looking statements made by us
    are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those
    summarized below.

•

Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and
    highly uncertain.

There are many difficulties and
    uncertainties inherent in new product research and development
    and the introduction of new products. There is a high rate of
    failure inherent in the research to develop new drugs. To bring
    a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to market
    typically takes a decade or more and costs over $1 billion.
    Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in
    the process after significant funds have been invested. As a
    result, there is a significant risk that funds invested in
    research programs will not generate financial returns. New
    product candidates that appear promising in development may fail
    to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success
    because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain
    necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses,
    difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of
    the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Delays
    and uncertainties in the FDA approval process and the approval
    processes in other countries can result in delays in product
    launches and lost market opportunity. In recent years, FDA
    review times have increased substantially and fewer new drugs
    are being approved. In addition, it can be very difficult to
    predict sales growth rates of new products.

-11-

•

We face intense competition.

We compete with
    large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies,
    biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies. To
    compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market
    innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical
    needs. Our product sales can be adversely affected by the
    introduction by competitors of branded products that are
    perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic versions of
    our branded products, and by generic versions of other products
    in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. See
    Item 1, “Business − Competition,” for
    more details.

•

Our long-term success depends on intellectual property
    protection

.  Our long-term success depends on our
    ability to continually discover, develop, and commercialize
    innovative new pharmaceutical products. Without strong
    intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate
    the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in
    research and development, capital, and other expenditures
    required to bring new drugs to the market. Several major
    products will lose intellectual property protection in the
    U.S. in the next decade beginning in late 2011. Several of
    these products will lose intellectual property protection in
    various countries outside the U.S. even before then. See
    Item 1, “Business − Patents, Trademarks,
    and Other Intellectual Property Protection,” for more
    details.

Intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and
    is subject to change over time. In the U.S., the Hatch-Waxman
    Act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to
    invalidate our patents; as a result, we expect that our
    U.S. patents on major products will be routinely
    challenged, and there can be no assurance that our patents will
    be upheld. See Item 1, “Business − Patents,
    Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Protection,”
    for more details. We are increasingly facing generic
    manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as well.
    In addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that
    our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property
    rights held by them. If successful, such claims could result in
    our being unable to market a product in a particular territory
    or being required to pay damages for past infringement or
    royalties on future sales.

•

Our business is subject to increasing government price
    controls and other health care cost containment
    measures.

Government health care cost-containment
    measures can significantly affect our sales and profitability.
    In many countries outside the United States, government agencies
    strictly control, directly or indirectly, the prices at which
    our products are sold. In the United States, we are subject to
    substantial pricing pressures from state Medicaid programs and
    private insurance programs and pharmacy benefit managers,
    including those operating under the Medicare Part D
    pharmaceutical benefit. Many federal and state legislative
    proposals would further negatively affect our pricing

and/or

reimbursement for our products. We expect pricing pressures from
    both governments and private payers inside and outside the
    United States to become more severe. See Item I,
    “Business − Regulations Affecting Pharmaceutical
    Pricing and Reimbursement,” for more details.

•

Pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or
    efficacy concerns.

Unexpected safety or efficacy
    concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, leading to
    product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as
    costly product liability claims.

•

We depend on key products for most of our revenues, cash
    flows, and earnings.

Zyprexa sales of
    $4.70 billion represented 23 percent of our revenues
    in 2008, and Cymbalta sales of $2.70 billion constituted
    13 percent of our 2008 revenues. Six other
    products − Humalog, Gemzar, Cialis, Alimta, Evista,
    and Humulin − each contributed more than
    $1 billion in revenues in 2008. If these or other key
    products were to become subject to a problem such as loss of
    patent protection, materially adverse changes in prescription
    growth rates, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings,
    material product liability litigation, publicity affecting
    doctor or patient confidence, or pressure from competitive
    products, the adverse impact on our revenues, cash flows and
    earnings could be significant.

•

Regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the
    company.

The marketing, promotional, and pricing
    practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner
    in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers,
    and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. Many
    companies, including Lilly, have been subject to claims related
    to these practices asserted by federal and state governmental
    authorities and private payers and consumers. These claims have
    resulted in substantial expense and other

-12-

significant consequences to the company. It is possible other
    products could become subject to investigation and that the
    outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and
    fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. In
    particular, See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis − Legal and Regulatory Matters,”
    for the discussions of the U.S. sales and marketing
    practices investigations. In addition, regulatory issues
    concerning compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice
    (cGMP) regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to
    product recalls and seizures, interruption of production leading
    to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new
    products pending resolution of the cGMP issues. We are now
    operating under a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office
    of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
    Services that requires us to maintain comprehensive compliance
    programs governing our research, manufacturing, and sales and
    marketing of pharmaceuticals. Material failures to comply with
    the Agreement could result in severe sanctions to the company.
    See Item 1, “Business − Regulation of our
    Operations,” for more details.

•

We face many product liability claims today, and future
    claims will be largely self-insured.

We are
    subject to a substantial number of product liability claims
    involving primarily Zyprexa, DES, and thimerosal, and because of
    the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we
    could become subject to large numbers of product liability
    claims for other products in the future. See Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis −
    Legal and Regulatory Matters,” and Item 3, “Legal
    Proceedings,” for more information on our current product
    liability litigation. In the past few years, we have experienced
    difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a
    very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially
    all our currently marketed products we have been and expect that
    we will continue to be largely self-insured for future product
    liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we
    will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on
    past claims.

•

Manufacturing difficulties could lead to product supply
    problems.

Pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex
    and highly regulated. Manufacturing difficulties can result in
    product shortages, leading to lost sales. See Item 1,
    “Business − Raw Materials and Product
    Supply,” for more details.

•

The current volatility in financial markets could adversely
    affect the cost and availability of
    financing.

Although the current contraction of
    the credit markets has not yet materially affected our borrowing
    costs or flexibility, if there is additional significant
    contraction of the markets, it could adversely affect our
    ability to obtain short-term or long-term financing at
    reasonable rates.

•

A prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our
    business and operating results.

While
    pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall
    economic cycles, a prolonged economic downturn coupled with
    rising unemployment (and a corresponding increase in the
    uninsured and underinsured population) could lead to decreased
    utilization of drugs, affecting our sales volume. Declining tax
    revenues attributable to the downturn may increase the pressure
    on governments to reduce healthcare spending, leading to
    increasing government efforts to control drug prices. In
    addition, a prolonged economic downturn could have an adverse
    impact on our investment portfolio, which could lead to the
    recognition of losses on our corporate investments and increased
    benefit expense related to our pension investments. Also, if our
    customers, suppliers or collaboration partners experience
    financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer
    collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults
    by suppliers or collaboration partners.

•

We face other risks to our business and operating
    results.

Our business is subject to a number of
    other risks and uncertainties, including:

•

Economic factors over which we have no control, including
    changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency
    exchange rates can affect our results of operations.

•

Changes in tax laws, including laws related to the remittance of
    foreign earnings or investments in foreign countries with
    favorable tax rates, and settlements of federal, state, and
    foreign tax audits, can affect our net income.

-13-

•

Changes in accounting standards promulgated by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange
    Commission, and the Emerging Issues Task Force can affect
    reported results.

•

Our results can also be affected by internal factors, such as
    changes in business strategies and the impact of restructurings,
    asset impairments, technology acquisition and disposition
    transactions, and business combinations.

We undertake no duty to update forward-looking statements.

Properties

Our principal domestic and international executive offices are
    located in Indianapolis. At December 31, 2008, we owned 15
    production and distribution facilities in the United States and
    Puerto Rico. Together with the corporate administrative offices,
    these facilities contain an aggregate of approximately
    15.6 million square feet of floor area dedicated to
    production, distribution, and administration. Major production
    sites include Indianapolis, Clinton, and Lafayette, Indiana; two
    sites in Puerto Rico; Branchburg, New Jersey; and Augusta,
    Georgia.

We own production and distribution facilities in 15 countries
    outside the United States and Puerto Rico, containing an
    aggregate of approximately 3.9 million square feet of floor
    space. Major production sites include facilities in France,
    Ireland, Spain, Brazil, Italy, and the United Kingdom. We lease
    production and warehouse facilities in Puerto Rico and several
    countries outside the United States.

Our research and development facilities in the United States
    consist of approximately 3.4 million square feet and are
    located primarily in Indianapolis, with smaller sites in
    San Diego and New York City. In October 2008 we sold our
    Greenfield, Indiana research facility to Covance Inc. Our major
    research and development facilities abroad are located in United
    Kingdom, Canada, Singapore, and Spain, and contain an aggregate
    of approximately 350,000 square feet.

We believe that none of our properties is subject to any
    encumbrance, easement, or other restriction that would detract
    materially from its value or impair its use in the operation of
    the business. The buildings we own are of varying ages and in
    good condition.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are a party to various currently pending legal actions,
    government investigations, and environmental proceedings, and we
    anticipate that such actions could be brought against us in the
    future. The most significant of these matters are described
    below or, as noted, in Part II, Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis −
    Legal and Regulatory Matters.” While it is not possible to
    determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations and
    proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except as
    otherwise specifically noted in Part II, Item 7, the
    resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse
    effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but
    could possibly be material to our consolidated results of
    operations in any one accounting period.

Legal
    Proceedings Described in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis

Other
    Patent Litigation

Strattera:

Actavis Elizabeth LLC (Actavis),
    Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA (Glenmark),
    Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Sun), Sandoz Inc.
    (Sandoz), Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan), Teva
    Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva), Apotex Inc. (Apotex),
    Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. (Aurobindo), Synthon Laboratories, Inc.
    (Synthon), and Zydus Pharmaceuticals, USA, Inc. (Zydus) each
    submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic versions
    of Strattera prior to the expiration of our relevant
    U.S. patent (expiring in 2017), and alleging that this
    patent is invalid. We filed a lawsuit against Actavis in the
    United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in
    August 2007, and added Glenmark, Sun, Sandoz, Mylan, Teva,
    Apotex, Aurobindo, Synthon, and Zydus as defendants in September
    2007. In December 2007, Zydus agreed to entry of a consent
    judgment in which Zydus conceded the validity and enforceability
    of the patent and agreed to a permanent injunction. In June
    2008, Glenmark agreed to entry of a permanent injunction,
    enjoining it from selling a generic product prior to the
    expiration of the U.S. patent. Also in June 2008, Synthon
    notified us that it has withdrawn its ANDA and agreed to a
    stipulated dismissal of all outstanding claims. For the
    remaining defendants, trial is anticipated as early as December
    2009.

Evista:

In June 2005, Dr. Alan Schreiber
    filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court
    for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania raising a number of
    claims, including patent infringement, misappropriation of trade
    secrets, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment, and seeking
    a declaration for inventorship of Lilly’s Evista
    method-of-use patents. After the original lawsuit was filed, the
    University of Pennsylvania was added as a plaintiff. This matter
    was settled in December 2008. The settlement did not have a
    material impact on our consolidated results of operations,
    liquidity, or financial position.

Cialis:

In July 2005, Vanderbilt University
    filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court in Delaware
    against ICOS Corporation seeking to add three of its
    scientists as co-inventors on the Cialis compound and
    method-of-use patents. In January 2009, the district court judge
    ruled in our favor, declining to add any of these scientists as
    an inventor on either patent. The plaintiff may appeal this
    ruling. We believe these claims are without legal merit and
    expect to prevail in any appeal of this litigation; however, it
    is not possible to determine the outcome. An unfavorable final
    outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
    results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.

In October 2002, Pfizer Inc. was issued a method-of-use patent
    in the United States and commenced a lawsuit in the United
    States District Court in Delaware against us, Lilly ICOS LLC,
    and ICOS Corporation (both now subsidiaries of Lilly)
    alleging that the marketing of Cialis for erectile dysfunction
    infringed this patent. This litigation has been stayed pending
    the outcome of a reexamination of the patent by the
    U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Office has now made a
    final rejection of the relevant patent claims which Pfizer is
    appealing. We believe Pfizer’s claims are without merit and
    expect to prevail. However, it is not possible to determine the
    outcome of this litigation.

Other
    Product Liability Litigation

We are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability
    lawsuits in the United States involving primarily Zyprexa,
    diethylstilbestrol (“DES”) and thimerosal.

In approximately 50 U.S. actions involving approximately 75
    claimants, plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of
    children or grandchildren of women who were prescribed DES
    during pregnancy.

We have been named as a defendant in approximately 210 actions
    in the U.S., involving approximately 285 claimants, brought in
    various state courts and federal district courts on behalf of
    children with autism or other

-15-

neurological disorders who received childhood vaccines
    (manufactured by other companies) that contained thimerosal, a
    generic preservative used in certain vaccines in the
    U.S. beginning in the 1930s. We purchased patents and
    conducted research pertaining to thimerosal in the 1920s. We
    have been named in the suits even though we discontinued
    manufacturing the raw material in 1974 and discontinued selling
    it in the United States to vaccine manufacturers in 1992.
    The lawsuits typically name the vaccine manufacturers as well as
    Lilly and other distributors of thimerosal, and allege that the
    children’s exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines
    caused their autism or other neurological disorders. We strongly
    deny any liability in these cases. There is no credible
    scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between
    thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism or other neurological
    disorders. In addition, we believe the majority of the cases
    should not be prosecuted in the courts in which they have been
    brought because the underlying claims are subject to the
    National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. Implemented in
    1988, the Act established a mandatory, federally administered
    no-fault claims process for individuals who allege that they
    were harmed by the administration of childhood vaccines. Under
    the Act, claims must first be brought before the U.S. Court
    of Claims for an award determination under the compensation
    guidelines established pursuant to the Act. Claimants who are
    unsatisfied with their awards under the Act may reject the award
    and seek traditional judicial remedies.

Other
    Marketing Practices Investigations

In November 2008, we received a subpoena from the
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of
    Inspector General in coordination with the U.S. Attorney
    for the Western District of New York seeking production of a
    wide range of documents and information relating to
    reimbursement of Alimta. We are cooperating in this
    investigation.

In February 2006, we reached a settlement of an investigation by
    the Office of Consumer Litigation, Department of Justice,
    related to our marketing and promotional practices and physician
    communications with respect to Evista. As part of the
    settlement, we agreed to plead guilty to one misdemeanor
    violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The plea was for
    the off-label promotion of Evista during 1998. The government
    did not charge the company with any unlawful intent, nor do we
    acknowledge any such intent. In connection with the overall
    settlement, we paid a total of $36.0 million. In addition,
    as part of the settlement, a civil consent decree requires us to
    continue to have a compliance program and to undertake a set of
    defined corporate integrity obligations related to Evista for
    five years.

In August 2003, we received notice that the staff of the SEC is
    conducting an investigation into the compliance by Polish
    subsidiaries of certain pharmaceutical companies, including
    Lilly, with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.
    The staff has issued subpoenas to us requesting production of
    documents related to the investigation. In connection with that
    matter, staffs of the SEC and the Department of Justice (DOJ)
    have asked us to voluntarily provide additional information
    related to certain activities of Lilly affiliates in a number of
    other countries. We are cooperating with the SEC and the DOJ in
    this investigation.

Shareholder
    Derivative Litigation

In 2007, the company received two demands from shareholders that
    the board of directors cause the company to take legal action
    against current and former directors and others for allegedly
    causing damage to the company through improper marketing of
    Evista, Prozac, and Zyprexa. In accordance with procedures
    established under the Indiana Business Corporation Law (Ind.
    Code

§ 23-1-32),

the board has appointed a committee of independent persons to
    consider the demands and determine what action, if any, the
    company should take in response. Since January 2008, we have
    been served with seven shareholder derivative lawsuits:

Lambrecht, et al. v. Taurel, et al.

, filed
    January 17, 2008, in the United States District Court for
    the Southern District of Indiana;

Staehr et al. v. Eli
    Lilly and Company et al.,

filed March 27, 2008, in
    Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis, Indiana;

Waldman et al., v. Eli Lilly and Company et al.

,
    filed February 11, 2008, in the United States District
    Court for the Eastern District of New York;

Solomon v.
    Eli Lilly and Company et al.

, filed March 27, 2008, in
    Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis, Indiana;

Robbins v. Taurel, et al.

, filed April 9, 2008,
    in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
    New York;

City of Taylor General Employees Retirement
    System v. Taurel, et al.

, filed April 15, 2008, in
    the United States

-16-

District Court for the Eastern District of New York; and

Zemprelli v. Taurel, et al

., filed June 24,
    2008, in the United States District Court for the Southern
    District of Indiana. Two of these lawsuits were filed by the
    shareholders who served the demands described above. All seven
    lawsuits are nominally filed on behalf of the company, against
    various current and former directors and officers and allege
    that the named officers and directors harmed the company through
    the improper marketing of Zyprexa, and in certain suits, Evista
    and Prozac. The Zemprelli suit also claims that certain
    defendants violated sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We believe these lawsuits are
    without merit and are prepared to defend against them vigorously.

Employee
    Litigation

In April 2006, three former employees and one current employee
    filed a putative class action against the company in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana
    (

Welch, et al. v. Eli Lilly and Company

, filed
    April 20, 2006) alleging racial discrimination.
    Plaintiffs have since amended their complaint twice, adding to
    the lawsuit a total of 154 individual plaintiffs as well as the
    national and local chapters of the National Association for the
    Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Under the current
    schedule, the plaintiffs are to file their class certification
    motion in March 2009. We believe this lawsuit is without merit
    and are prepared to defend against it vigorously.

We have also been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York
    (

Schaefer-LaRose, et al

., filed November 14,
    2006) claiming that our pharmaceutical sales
    representatives should have been categorized as
    “non-exempt” rather than “exempt” employees,
    and claiming that the company owes them back wages for overtime
    worked, as well as penalties, interest, and attorneys fees.
    Other pharmaceutical industry participants face identical
    lawsuits. The case was transferred to the U.S. District
    Court for the Southern District of Indiana in August 2007. In
    February 2008, the Indianapolis court conditionally certified a
    nationwide opt-in collective action under the Fair Labor
    Standards Act of all current and former employees who served as
    a Lilly pharmaceutical sales representative at any time from
    November 2003 to the present. As of the close of the opt-in
    period, fewer than 400 of the over 7,500 potential plaintiffs
    elected to participate in the lawsuit. We believe this lawsuit
    is without merit and are prepared to defend against it
    vigorously.

We have been named in a lawsuit brought by the Labor Attorney
    for

th

Region

    in the Labor Court of Paulinia, State of Sao Paulo, alleging
    possible harm to employees and former employees caused by
    exposure to heavy metals. We have also been named in
    approximately 50 lawsuits filed in the same court by individual
    former employees making similar claims. We believe these
    lawsuits are without merit and are prepared to defend against
    them vigorously.

Other
    Matters

In October 2005, the U.S. Attorney’s office for the
    Eastern District of Pennsylvania advised that it is conducting
    an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into
    with a pharmacy benefit manager covering Axid, Evista, Humalog,
    Humulin, Prozac, and Zyprexa. The inquiry includes a review of
    our Medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales
    covered by the rebate agreements. We are cooperating in this
    matter.

In October 2005, we received a subpoena from the
    U.S. Attorney’s office for the District of
    Massachusetts for the production of documents relating to our
    business relationship with a long-term care pharmacy
    organization concerning Actos, Evista, Humalog, Humulin, and
    Zyprexa. We are cooperating in this matter.

Between 2003 and 2005, various municipalities in New York sued
    us and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers, claiming in
    general that as a result of alleged improprieties by the
    manufacturers in the calculation and reporting of average
    wholesale prices for purposes of Medicaid reimbursement, the
    municipalities overpaid their portion of the cost of
    pharmaceuticals. The suits seek monetary and other relief,
    including civil penalties and treble damages. Similar suits were
    filed against us and many other manufacturers by the States of
    Mississippi, Iowa, Utah, and Kansas. These suits are pending
    either in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts or in various state courts. All of these suits are
    in early stages or discovery is ongoing.

-17-

During 2004 we, along with several other pharmaceutical
    companies, were named in a consolidated lawsuit in California
    state court brought on behalf of consumers alleging that the
    conduct of pharmaceutical companies in preventing commercial
    importation of prescription drugs from outside the United States
    violated antitrust laws. The case sought restitution for alleged
    overpayments for pharmaceuticals and an injunction against the
    allegedly violative conduct. Summary judgment was granted to us
    and the other defendants. In July 2008, the California Court of
    Appeals affirmed that decision. The California Supreme Court has
    accepted plaintiff’s appeal, and we expect it to be heard
    later this year.

In July 2008, we received a request from the Civil Division of
    the United States Department of Justice requesting the
    production of documents related to nominal pricing. We are
    cooperating in this matter.

We previously received requests for information about Zyprexa
    from the offices of Representative Henry Waxman, former Chair of
    the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and
    Senator Charles Grassley, ranking member of the Senate Finance
    Committee. We also received a request from Representative
    Waxman’s office for information about drug pricing under
    Medicare Part D. We are cooperating with these requests.

Along with over 100 other pharmaceutical companies operating in
    Europe, we have received a questionnaire from the European
    Commission as part of its ongoing inquiry into whether
    pharmaceutical companies have improperly blocked or created
    artificial barriers to pharmaceutical innovation or market entry
    of medicines through the misuse of patent rights, settlement of
    patent claims, litigation, or other means. We are cooperating
    with this request.

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
    and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, we have been
    designated as one of several potentially responsible parties
    with respect to the cleanup of fewer than 10 sites. Under
    Superfund, each responsible party may be jointly and severally
    liable for the entire amount of the cleanup.

We are also a defendant in other litigation and investigations,
    including product liability, patent, employment, and premises
    liability litigation, of a character we regard as normal to our
    business.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition

Review of
    Operations

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

This section provides an overview of our financial results,
    recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, significant
    business development, and legal, regulatory, and other matters
    affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry.

Financial
    Results

We achieved worldwide sales growth of 9 percent, which was
    primarily driven by volume increases in several key products.
    The favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on cost of sales
    contributed to an improvement in gross margin. Marketing,
    selling, and administrative expenses grew at the same rate as
    sales, driven by pre-launch activities associated with
    prasugrel, marketing costs associated with Cymbalta and Evista,
    the impact of foreign exchange rates, and increased
    litigation-related expenses; while our investment in research
    and development grew 10 percent. We completed our
    acquisition of ImClone Systems Inc. (ImClone), resulting in a
    significant charge of $4.69 billion for acquired in-process
    research and development (IPR&D) and reached resolution on
    government investigations related to our past
    U.S. marketing and promotional practices for Zyprexa,
    resulting in an additional charge of $1.48 billion. We
    incurred tax expense of $764.3 million, despite a loss
    before income taxes of $1.31 billion, primarily caused by
    the non-deductibility of the ImClone IPR&D charge and the
    partial deductibility of the Zyprexa investigation settlements.
    Accordingly, earnings decreased $5.02 billion, to a net
    loss of $2.07 billion, and earnings per share decreased
    $4.60, to a loss of $1.89 per share, in 2008 as compared with
    net income of $2.95 billion, or earnings per share of $2.71
    in 2007. Net income comparisons between 2008 and 2007 are
    affected by the impact of the following significant items (see
    Notes 3, 5, 12, and 14 to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information):


Acquisitions
    (Note 3)

•

We recognized charges totaling $4.73 billion (pretax)
    associated with the acquisition of ImClone, which decreased
    earnings per share by $4.46. These amounts include an IPR&D
    charge of $4.69 billion (pretax). The remaining net
    expenses are related to ImClone’s operating results
    subsequent to the acquisition, incremental interest costs, and
    amortization of the intangible asset associated with Erbitux. We
    also incurred IPR&D charges of $28.0 million (pretax)
    associated with the acquisition of SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
    (SGX), which decreased earnings per share by $.03.

•

We incurred IPR&D charges associated with licensing
    arrangements with BioMS Medical Corp. (BioMS) and TransPharma
    Medical Ltd. totaling $122.0 million (pretax), which
    decreased earnings per share by $.07.

-19-

Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other
    Special Charges (Notes 5 and 14)

•

We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other
    special charges totaling $497.0 million (pretax), which
    decreased earnings per share by $.30. A similar charge of
    $57.1 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share
    by $.04, was included in cost of sales. These charges were
    primarily associated with the sale of our Greenfield, Indiana
    site, the termination of the
    AIR

®

Insulin program, and strategic exit activities related to
    manufacturing operations.

•

We recorded charges of $1.48 billion (pretax) related to
    the federal and state Zyprexa investigations led by the
    U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
    (EDPA), as well as the resolution of a multi-state investigation
    regarding Zyprexa involving 32 states and the District of
    Columbia, which decreased earnings per share by $1.20.

Other
    (Note 12)

•

We recognized a discrete income tax benefit of
    $210.3 million as a result of the resolution of a
    substantial portion of the IRS audit of our federal income tax
    returns for the years 2001 through 2004, which increased
    earnings per share by $.19.


Acquisitions
    (Note 3)

•

We incurred IPR&D charges associated with the acquisitions
    of ICOS Corporation (ICOS), Hypnion, Inc. (Hypnion), and
    Ivy Animal Health, Inc. (Ivy), totaling $631.6 million
    (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.57.

•

We incurred IPR&D charges associated with our licensing
    arrangements with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited India,
    MacroGenics, Inc., and OSI Pharmaceuticals, totaling
    $114.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share
    by $.06.

-20-

Asset
    Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges
    (Notes 5 and 14)

•

We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other
    special charges of $190.6 million (pretax), which decreased
    earnings per share by $.12. These charges were primarily
    associated with previously announced strategic decisions
    affecting manufacturing and research facilities.

•

We incurred a special charge following a settlement with one of
    our insurance carriers over Zyprexa product liability claims,
    which led to a reduction of our expected product liability
    insurance recoveries, and other product liability charges. This
    resulted in a charge totaling $111.9 million (pretax),
    which decreased earnings per share by $.09.

Late-Stage
    Pipeline Developments and Business Development
    Activity

Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability
    to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical
    products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in
    development by other biotech-nology or pharmaceutical companies.
    There were a number of late-stage pipeline developments and
    business development transactions within the past year,
    including:

Pipeline

•

We, along with our partner Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, are
    seeking from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
    approval for prasugrel as a treatment for patients with acute
    coronary syndrome being managed with percutaneous coronary
    intervention. The Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory
    Committee of the FDA reviewed prasugrel during a hearing and
    unanimously recommended it for approval. The FDA will consider
    the recommendation as it continues its review and makes its
    final decision.

•

Prasugrel was approved for marketing by the European Commission
    under the trade name Efient in February 2009 for the prevention
    of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary
    syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

•

We received a complete response letter from the FDA for
    olanzapine long-acting injection (LAI) for acute and maintenance
    treatment of schizophrenia in adults. We are continuing to work
    with the agency on the new drug application (NDA). The FDA does
    not require any additional clinical trials for the continued
    review of the NDA. Per the agency’s request, we are
    preparing a proposed Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy,
    which will be submitted in the near future. In addition,
    olanzapine long-acting injection was approved by the European
    Commission under the trade name
    Zypadhera

tm

.

•

We withdrew our supplemental NDA from the FDA for Cymbalta for
    the management of chronic pain. We plan to resubmit the
    application in the first half of 2009, adding data from a
    recently completed study in chronic osteoarthritis pain of the
    knee.

•

The FDA approved Alimta, in combination with cisplatin, as a
    first-line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic
    non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients with nonsquamous
    histology. The European health authorities also approved Alimta,
    in combination with cisplatin, as a first-line treatment for
    non-small cell lung cancer patients with other than
    predominantly squamous cell histology.

•

We submitted tadalafil as a treatment for pulmonary arterial
    hypertension (PAH) to regulatory authorities in the U.S.,
    Europe, and Japan.

•

The FDA approved Cymbalta for the management of fibromyalgia, a
    chronic pain disorder. In addition, the European Commission
    approved Cymbalta for the treatment of generalized anxiety
    disorder (GAD).

•

We, along with our partner Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
    (Amylin), submitted Byetta as a monotherapy treatment for type 2
    diabetes to the FDA.

•

The European Commission approved a new indication for
    Forsteo

for the treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained,
    systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and men at increased
    risk for fracture. We have also received an approvable letter
    from the FDA for Forteo for the same indication.

•

We terminated development of our AIR Insulin program, which was
    being conducted in collaboration with Alkermes, Inc. The program
    had been in Phase III clinical development as a potential
    treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This decision was not
    a result of any observations during AIR Insulin trials relating
    to the safety of the product, but rather was a result of
    increasing uncertainties in the regulatory environment and a
    thorough evaluation of the evolving commercial and clinical
    potential of the product compared to existing medical therapies.

Business
    Development

•

We acquired all of the outstanding shares of ImClone for a total
    purchase price of approximately $6.5 billion. This
    strategic combination will offer both targeted therapies and
    oncolytic agents along with an oncology pipeline spanning all
    phases of clinical development. It also expands our
    biotechnology capabilities.

•

We entered into a license and a supply arrangement with United
    Therapeutics Corporation related to the
    U.S. commercialization rights for the PAH indication of
    tadalafil. We received an upfront payment of $150.0 million
    in exchange for exclusive rights to commercialize tadalafil for
    PAH in the U.S., as well as for a product manufacturing and
    supply arrangement. As part of this arrangement, we acquired a
    $150.0 million equity position in the company. The
    indication is currently under review by the FDA.

•

We acquired the worldwide rights to the dairy cow supplement
    Posilac, as well as the product’s supporting operations,
    from Monsanto Company (Monsanto) for an upfront payment of
    $300.0 million, as well as contingent consideration based
    on future Posilac sales. The acquisition of Posilac provides us
    with a product that complements those of our animal health
    product line.

•

We sold our Greenfield Laboratories site in Greenfield, Indiana,
    to Covance Inc. We also signed a

10-year

service agreement, under which Covance will assume
    responsibility for our toxicology testing and other R&D
    support activities at the site.

•

We acquired SGX for approximately $64 million in
    cash.  The acquisition allows us to integrate
    SGX’s structure-guided drug discovery platform into our
    drug discovery efforts. It also gives us access to
    FAST

tm

,

    SGX’s fragment-based, protein structure guided drug
    discovery technology, and to a portfolio of preclinical oncology
    compounds focused on a number of kinase targets.

•

We entered into a licensing and development agreement with
    TransPharma Medical Ltd. (TransPharma) to acquire rights to its
    product and related drug delivery system for the treatment of
    osteoporosis. The product, which is administered transdermally
    using TransPharma’s proprietary technology, is currently in
    Phase II clinical testing.

•

We entered into an agreement with an affiliate of TPG-Axon
    Capital (TPG) for the Phase III development of our two lead
    molecules for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. This
    agreement provides TPG with success-based milestones and
    royalties in exchange for clinical trial funding.

•

We entered into a licensing and development agreement with BioMS
    whereby we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to a multiple
    sclerosis (MS) compound. The compound is currently being
    evaluated in two pivotal Phase III clinical trials in
    secondary progressive MS.

Legal,
    Regulatory, and Other Matters

In March 2004, we were notified by the U.S. Attorney’s
    office for the EDPA that it had commenced an investigation
    relating to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices
    for Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac
    Weekly

tm

.

    In October 2008, we announced that we were in advanced
    discussions to resolve the ongoing investigations led by the
    EDPA, and we recorded a charge of $1.42 billion. In January
    2009, we announced that the discussions had been successfully
    concluded, and that we settled the Zyprexa-related federal
    claims, as well as similar Medicaid-related claims of states
    which decide to participate in the settlement.

Beginning in August 2006, we received civil investigative
    demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of
    states under various state consumer protection laws seeking
    documents pertaining to Zyprexa. In

-22-

October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and
    the District of Columbia, under which we paid $62.0 million.

In December 2008, the Federal Supreme Court (BGH) in Germany
    re-established our Zyprexa patent that had been declared invalid
    in 2007 by the German Federal Patent Court. As a result of this
    ruling, generic olanzapine has been withdrawn from the German
    market as of the beginning of 2009.

We continue to reach agreements with claimants’ attorneys
    involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to
    settle claims against us relating to the medication.
    Approximately 120 claims remain.

In the third quarter of 2008, we initiated a strategic review of
    our Tippecanoe manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Indiana.
    Options being considered for this site include continuing
    operations with a revised site mission, exploring opportunities
    to sell the facility, and ceasing operations altogether. The
    review is expected to last six to twelve months. No final
    decisions have been made at this time; however, depending on the
    decision, we could record significant charges.

In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
    Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) continues to
    provide an effective prescription drug benefit under the
    Medicare program (known as Medicare Part D). Various
    measures have been discussed

and/or

passed in both the U.S. House of Representatives and
    U.S. Senate that would impose additional pricing pressures
    on our products, including proposals to legalize the importation
    of prescription drugs and either allow, or require, the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices
    within Medicare Part D directly with pharmaceutical
    manufacturers. Additionally, various proposals have been
    introduced that would increase the rebates we pay on sales to
    Medicaid patients or impose additional rebates on sales to
    patients who receive their medicines through Medicare
    Part D. Uncertainty exists surrounding the new
    administration and Congress and the impact any government
    decisions or programs will have on the pharmaceutical industry.
    In addition, many states are facing substantial budget
    difficulties due to the downturn in the economy and are expected
    to seek aggressive cuts or other offsets in healthcare spending.
    We expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to
    become more severe, which could have a material adverse effect
    on our consolidated results of operations.

International operations also are generally subject to extensive
    price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for
    additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that
    would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or
    reduce the value of our intellectual property protection.

Prior to the acquisition of ICOS in
    late January 2007, the Cialis sales shown do not include sales
    in the joint-venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North
    America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the
    joint-venture territory sales for January 2007, net of expenses
    and income taxes, is reported in other — net in our
    consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the
    acquisition, all Cialis product sales are reported in our net
    sales. Worldwide 2008 sales for Cialis grew 19 percent from
    2007 sales of $1.22 billion.

OPERATING
    RESULTS — 2008

Sales

Our worldwide sales for 2008 increased 9 percent, to
    $20.38 billion, driven primarily by growth of Cymbalta,
    Cialis, Alimta, Humalog, and Gemzar. Worldwide sales volume
    increased 5 percent, while foreign exchange rates
    contributed 3 percent, and selling prices contributed
    2 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.) Sales in
    the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $10.93 billion,
    driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, Humalog,
    Cialis, and Alimta. Sales outside the U.S. increased
    11 percent, to $9.44 billion, driven primarily by the
    sales growth of Alimta, Cialis, Cymbalta, and Humalog.

Zyprexa, our top-selling product, is a treatment for
    schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with
    bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in
    the U.S. decreased 1 percent in 2008, driven by lower
    demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the
    U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by decreased demand
    and to a lesser extent, lower prices, partially offset by the
    favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Demand outside the
    U.S. was unfavorably impacted by generic competition in
    Germany and Canada. As noted previously, generic olanzapine has
    been withdrawn from the German market as of the beginning of
    2009.

Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major
    depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain,
    generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia, increased
    23 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to
    a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 66 percent, driven by increased demand
    and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates and higher prices. Higher demand outside the
    U.S. reflects increased demand in established markets as
    well as recent launches in new markets.

Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the
    treatment of diabetes, increased 14 percent in the U.S.,
    driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 24 percent, driven by increased demand
    and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates.

-24-

Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to fight various cancers,
    increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by increased
    demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased
    7 percent, driven primarily by the favorable impact of
    foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, increased
    demand, partially offset by lower prices. We will likely face
    increased generic competition in certain markets outside the
    U.S. in 2009.

Our sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction,
    increased 27 percent in the U.S., driven by increased
    demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased
    26 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser
    extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and
    higher prices. Total worldwide sales of Cialis increased
    19 percent to $1.44 billion in 2008 as compared to
    $1.22 billion in 2007. This includes $72.7 million of
    sales in the Lilly ICOS joint-venture territories for the 2007
    period prior to the acquisition of ICOS.

Sales of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased
    25 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to
    a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 46 percent, driven by increased demand
    and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates.

Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of
    osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for risk reduction of
    invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis
    and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast
    cancer, decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by
    decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales
    outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent, driven by lower
    demand and lower prices, partially offset by the favorable
    impact of foreign exchange rates. As described in Legal and
    Regulatory Matters, Evista is the subject of a Hatch-Waxman
    patent challenge by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva), which
    has received tentative approval of its Abbreviated New Drug
    Application (ANDA) from the FDA. Unless the current stay on
    Teva’s approved ANDA remains in force or Teva is
    preliminarily enjoined from markets if the stay is lifted, it is
    possible that Teva could choose to launch before the current
    action against Teva is concluded. Such a launch could have a
    material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of
    operations.

Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment
    of diabetes, increased 4 percent in the U.S., driven by
    higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased
    10 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates and increased demand.

Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in
    postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture,
    decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased
    demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 34 percent, driven by increased demand
    and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates.

Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit
    hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults,
    decreased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased
    demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 35 percent, driven primarily by
    increased demand.

Worldwide sales of Byetta, an injectable product for the
    treatment of type 2 diabetes that we market with Amylin,
    increased 16 percent to $751.4 million during 2008. We
    report as revenue our 50 percent share of Byetta’s
    gross margin in the U.S., 100 percent of Byetta sales
    outside the U.S., and our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices
    to Amylin. Our revenues increased 20 percent to
    $396.1 million in 2008.

Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased
    12 percent, driven by the inclusion of U.S. Posilac
    sales since the date of acquisition. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 8 percent, driven by increased demand
    and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates.

Gross
    Margin, Costs, and Expenses

The 2008 gross margin increased to 78.5 percent of
    sales compared with 77.2 percent for 2007. This increase
    was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange
    rates.

-25-

Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased
    9 percent in 2008, to $6.63 billion. This increase was
    due to increased marketing and selling expenses, including
    prelaunch expenses for prasugrel and marketing costs associated
    with Cymbalta and Evista; the impact of foreign exchange rates;
    and increased litigation-related expenses. Investment in
    research and development increased 10 percent, to
    $3.84 billion, due to increased late-stage clinical trial
    and discovery research costs.

Acquired IPR&D charges related to the acquisitions of
    ImClone and SGX, as well as our in-licensing arrangements with
    BioMS and TransPharma, were $4.84 billion in 2008 as
    compared to $745.6 million in

-26-

2007. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other
    special charges of $1.97 billion in 2008, as compared to
    $302.5 million in 2007. The 2008 charges were primarily
    associated with the resolution of Zyprexa investigations with
    the U.S. Attorney for the EDPA and multiple states. See
    Notes 3, 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements
    for additional information.

Other — net decreased $148.1 million, to a net
    expense of $26.1 million. This line item consists of
    interest expense, interest income, the after-tax operating
    results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture, and all other
    miscellaneous income and expense items.

•

Interest expense for 2008 was essentially flat at
    $228.3 million. The impact of lower interest rates on our
    debt was substantially offset by lower capitalized interest due
    to lower

construction-in-progress

balances and increased interest expense due to the financing of
    the ImClone acquisition.

•

Interest income for 2008 decreased $4.6 million, to
    $210.7 million, as lower interest rates were partially
    offset by higher cash balances.

•

The Lilly ICOS joint venture income prior to the 2007
    acquisition was $11.0 million. Subsequent to the
    acquisition, all activity related to ICOS is included in our
    consolidated financial results.

•

Net other miscellaneous items decreased $132.5 million to a
    loss of $8.5 million, primarily as a result of lower
    outlicensing income and increased net losses on investment
    securities in 2008 (the majority of which consisted of
    unrealized losses).

We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million in 2008, despite
    having a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion. Our net
    loss was driven by the $4.69 billion acquired IPR&D
    charge for ImClone and the $1.48 billion Zyprexa
    investigation settlements. The IPR&D charge was not tax
    deductible, and only a portion of the Zyprexa investigation
    settlements was deductible. In addition, we recorded tax expense
    associated with the ImClone acquisition, as well as a discrete
    income tax benefit of $210.3 million for the resolution of
    the IRS audit. The effective tax rate was 23.8 percent in
    2007. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements
    for additional information.

OPERATING
    RESULTS — 2007

Financial
    Results

We achieved worldwide sales growth of
    19 percent.  This growth was primarily driven by
    volume increases in a number of key products, with a significant
    portion of this increase in volume resulting from the
    acquisition of ICOS. Our additional investments in marketing and
    selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta
    and the diabetes care products, contributed to this sales growth
    and enabled us to increase our investment in research and
    development 11 percent in 2007. While cost of sales and
    operating expenses in the aggregate grew at approximately the
    same rate as sales, other — net decreased and the
    effective tax rate increased. As a result, net income and
    earnings per share increased 11 percent, to
    $2.95 billion, or $2.71 per share, in 2007 as compared with
    $2.66 billion, or $2.45 per share, in 2006. Net income
    comparisons between 2007 and 2006 are affected by the impact of
    significant items that are reflected in our financial results.
    The significant items for 2007 are summarized in the Executive
    Overview. The 2006 items are summarized as follows (see
    Notes 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information):

•

We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other
    special charges of $450.3 million (pretax) in the fourth
    quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.31
    (Note 5).

•

In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge related to Zyprexa
    product liability litigation matters of $494.9 million
    (pretax), or $.42 per share (Notes 5 and 14).

Sales

Our worldwide sales for 2007 increased 19 percent, to
    $18.63 billion, driven primarily by the inclusion of Cialis
    since our January 29, 2007 acquisition of ICOS and sales
    growth of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Alimta, Gemzar, and Humalog.
    Worldwide sales volume increased 12 percent, while selling
    prices and foreign

-27-

exchange rates each increased sales by 3 percent. (Numbers
    do not add due to rounding.) Sales in the U.S. increased
    18 percent, to $10.15 billion, driven primarily by
    increased sales of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Alimta, and Byetta, and
    the inclusion of Cialis. Sales outside the U.S. increased
    20 percent, to $8.49 billion, driven primarily by the
    inclusion of Cialis, and sales growth of Zyprexa, Alimta,
    Gemzar, and Cymbalta.

Prior to the acquisition of ICOS,
    the Cialis sales shown in the table above represent results only
    in the territories in which we marketed Cialis exclusively. The
    remaining sales relate to the joint-venture territories of Lilly
    ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our
    share of the joint-venture territory sales, net of expenses and
    income taxes, is reported in other — net in our
    consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the
    acquisition, all Cialis product sales are reported in our net
    sales.

Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 6 percent in 2007,
    driven by higher net selling prices, partially offset by lower
    demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent,
    driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and
    increased demand.

Sales of Cymbalta increased 58 percent in the U.S., driven
    primarily by strong demand. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 70 percent, driven by increased demand
    and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

Sales of Gemzar increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by
    higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 16 percent, driven by increased demand
    and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

Sales of Humalog increased 9 percent in the U.S., driven by
    higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 20 percent, driven by increased demand
    and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially
    offset by declining prices.

Total worldwide sales of Cialis were $1.22 billion and
    $971.0 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. This
    includes $72.7 million of sales in the Lilly ICOS
    joint-venture territories for the 2007 period prior to the
    acquisition of ICOS. Worldwide sales grew 25 percent in
    2007. U.S. sales increased 20 percent in 2007, driven
    by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 28 percent in 2007, driven by increased
    demand, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and
    higher prices.

-28-

Sales of Evista increased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by
    higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased
    1 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices and lower
    demand.

Sales of Humulin decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by
    lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside
    the U.S. increased 11 percent, driven by increased
    demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates,
    partially offset by lower prices.

Sales of Alimta increased 28 percent in the U.S., driven by
    increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales
    outside the U.S. increased 55 percent, driven by
    increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact
    of foreign exchange rates.

Sales of Forteo increased 19 percent in the U.S., driven by
    higher net selling prices. U.S. sales growth benefited from
    access to medical coverage through the Medicare Part D
    program and decreased utilization of our U.S. patient
    assistance program and, to a lesser extent, increased demand.
    Sales outside the U.S. increased 21 percent, driven by
    increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange
    rates.

Sales of Strattera decreased 9 percent in the U.S., as a
    result of decreased demand. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 50 percent, driven by increased demand
    and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

Our revenues from Actos decreased 46 percent in the
    U.S. Sales outside the U.S. increased 30 percent,
    driven primarily by increased demand and, to a lesser extent,
    the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

Worldwide sales of Byetta increased 51 percent to
    $650.2 million during 2007. Our revenues increased
    51 percent to $330.7 million in 2007.

Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased
    18 percent, driven by increased demand, the acquisition of
    Ivy Animal Health, and new companion-animal product launches.
    Sales outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, driven by
    the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased
    demand.

Gross
    Margin, Costs, and Expenses

The 2007 gross margin decreased to 77.2 percent of
    sales compared with 77.4 percent for 2006. This decrease
    was primarily due to the expense resulting from the amortization
    of the intangible assets acquired in the ICOS acquisition, the
    unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and production
    volumes growing at a slower rate than sales, offset partially by
    manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales.

Operating expenses (the aggregate of research and development
    and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses) increased
    19 percent in 2007. Investment in research and development
    increased 11 percent, to $3.49 billion. In addition to
    the acquisition of ICOS, this increase was due to increases in
    discovery research and late-stage clinical trial costs.
    Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased
    25 percent in 2007, to $6.10 billion. This increase
    was largely due to the impact of the ICOS acquisition, as well
    as increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key
    products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care products, and
    the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

Acquired IPR&D charges were $745.6 million in 2007 and
    related to the acquisitions of ICOS, Hypnion, and Ivy, as well
    as our licensing arrangements with OSI, MacroGenics, and
    Glenmark. We incurred asset impairments, restructuring, and
    other special charges of $302.5 million in 2007 as compared
    to $945.2 million in 2006. See Notes 3, 5 and 14 to
    the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Other — net decreased $115.8 million, to income
    of $122.0 million. This line item consists of interest
    expense, interest income, the after-tax operating results of the
    Lilly ICOS joint venture, and all other miscellaneous income and
    expense items.

•

Interest expense for 2007 decreased $9.8 million, to
    $228.3 million. This decrease is a result of lower average
    debt balances in 2007 compared to 2006.

•

Interest income for 2007 decreased $46.6 million, to
    $215.3 million, due to lower cash balances in 2007 compared
    to 2006.

-29-

•

The Lilly ICOS joint-venture income was $11.0 million in
    2007 as compared to $96.3 million in 2006, due to the
    acquisition of ICOS on January 29, 2007.

•

Net other miscellaneous income items increased $6.3 million
    to $124.0 million.

We incurred tax expense of $923.8 million in 2007,
    resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.8 percent,
    compared with 22.1 percent for 2006. The effective tax
    rates for 2007 and 2006 were affected primarily by the
    nondeductible ICOS and Hypnion IPR&D charges of
    $594.6 million in 2007, and the product liability charges
    of $494.9 million in 2006. The tax effect of the product
    liability charge was less than our effective tax rate, as the
    tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the
    countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge.
    See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

As of December 31, 2008, cash, cash equivalents, and
    short-term investments totaled $5.93 billion compared with
    $4.83 billion at December 31, 2007. Cash flow from
    operations in 2008 of $7.30 billion and net proceeds from
    the issuance of debt of $4.41 billion exceeded the total of
    the net cash paid for corporate acquisitions of
    $6.08 billion, dividends paid of $2.06 billion,
    purchases of property and equipment of $947.2 million, and
    net purchases of noncurrent investments of $815.1 million.

Capital expenditures of $947.2 million during 2008 were
    $135.2 million less than in 2007. We expect 2009 capital
    expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion as we invest
    in our biotechnology capabilities, continue to upgrade our
    manufacturing and research facilities to enhance productivity
    and quality systems, and invest in the long-term growth of our
    diabetes care products.

Total debt as of December 31, 2008 increased
    $5.45 billion, to $10.46 billion, reflecting the
    commercial paper we issued in November 2008 primarily to finance
    our acquisition of ImClone, offset by long-term debt repayments
    and paydown of commercial paper with cash and cash equivalents
    on hand. Our current debt ratings from Standard &
    Poor’s and Moody’s are at AA and A1, respectively.

Dividends of $1.88 per share were paid in 2008, an increase of
    11 percent from 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008,
    effective for the first-quarter dividend in 2009, the quarterly
    dividend was increased to $.49 per share (a 4.3 percent
    increase), resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2009 of
    $1.96 per share. The year 2008 was the

-30-

124th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments
    and the 41st consecutive year in which dividends have been
    increased.

In recent months, global economic conditions have deteriorated.
    Triggered by the liquidity crisis in the capital markets, the
    implications have become more widespread, resulting in higher
    unemployment and declines in real consumer spending. In
    addition, many financial institutions have tightened lines of
    credit, reducing funding available for near-term economic
    growth. Pharmaceutical consumption has traditionally been
    relatively unaffected by economic downturns; however, an
    extended downturn could lead to a decline in overall
    prescriptions corresponding with the growth of the uninsured and
    underinsured population in the U.S. In addition, both
    private and public health care payers are facing heightened
    fiscal challenges due to the economic slowdown and are taking
    aggressive steps to reduce the costs of care, including
    pressures for increased pharmaceutical discounts and rebates and
    efforts to drive greater use of generic drugs. We continue to
    monitor the potential near-term impact of prescription trends,
    the credit worthiness of our wholesalers and other customers and
    suppliers, the decline of health insurance coverage in the
    overall population, and the federal government’s
    involvement in the economic crisis.

We believe that cash generated from operations, along with
    available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund
    our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital
    expenditures, costs associated with litigation and government
    investigations, and dividends in 2009. We believe that amounts
    accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be
    adequate to fund short-term borrowings. Our access to credit
    markets has not been adversely affected by the recent
    illiquidity in the market because of the high credit quality of
    our short- and long-term debt. In 2009, we intend to fund
    payments required in connection with the EDPA settlements, and
    to further reduce outstanding commercial paper with cash and
    cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from operations, and
    the issuance of longterm debt. We currently have
    $1.24 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities,
    $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program.
    Additionally, in November 2008, we obtained a one-year
    short-term revolving credit facility in the amount of
    $4.00 billion as

back-up,

alternative financing. Various risks and uncertainties,
    including those discussed in the Financial Expectations for 2009
    section, may affect our operating results and cash generated
    from operations.

-31-

In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to
    fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These
    fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and
    operating. We address a portion of these risks through a
    controlled program of risk management that includes the use of
    derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling
    these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations
    in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative
    activities are for purposes other than trading.

Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in
    short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to
    manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an
    acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt
    positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help
    maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate
    exposure at December 31, 2008 and 2007, including
    derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments,
    a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied
    to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, would have no material impact on
    earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate
    risksensitive instruments over a one-year period.

Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating
    currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against
    the euro and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the
    euro. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when
    we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis,
    denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also
    face currency exposure that arises from translating the results
    of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange
    rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We
    may use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our
    foreign currency exposures. Our policy outlines the minimum and
    maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on
    these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of
    currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities,
    commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our
    derivative financial instruments outstanding at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, a hypothetical 10 percent
    change in exchange rates (primarily against the
    U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash
    flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk-sensitive
    instruments over a one-year period. These calculations do not
    reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the
    underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the
    results of the derivative instruments.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material
    current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material
    future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
    condition, revenues or expenses,

-32-

results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or
    capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on assets still in
    development and enter into research and development arrangements
    with third parties that often require milestone and royalty
    payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of
    certain future events linked to the success of the asset in
    development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon
    the successful achievement of an important point in the
    development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g.,
    approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate
    regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales
    levels). If required by the arrangement, we may have to make
    royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the
    pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for
    marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these
    payments, they are not included in the table of contractual
    obligations.

Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one
    annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple
    products covered by these arrangements would happen to be
    reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to
    expense could be material to the results of operations in any
    one period. These arrangements often give us the discretion to
    unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would
    allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we
    are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully
    achieves clinical testing objectives. We also note that, from a
    business perspective, we view these payments as positive because
    they signify that the product is successfully moving through
    development and is now generating or is more likely to generate
    cash flows from sales of products.

Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will
    require future cash payments are as follows (in millions):

Our long-term debt obligations

    at December 31, 2008 to compute the amount of the
    contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt
    instruments and swaps.


We have included the following:

•

Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase
    orders at our significant operating locations as of
    December 31, 2008. Some of these purchase orders may be
    cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have
    not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase
    obligations.

•

Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant
    vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent.


We have included long-term
    liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified
    supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred
    compensation liabilities. We excluded liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits of $906.2 million, as we cannot
    reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows
    associated with those liabilities.


This category comprises primarily
    minimum pension funding requirements.

The contractual obligations table is current as of
    December 31, 2008. We expect the amount of these
    obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are
    initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or
    modified.

APPLICATION
    OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In preparing our financial statements in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related
    disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and
    complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those
    estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we
    make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable
    judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop
    different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and
    circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other
    reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated results of operations, financial position, or
    liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most
    critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit
    committee and are described below.

Revenue
    Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount
    Accruals

We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of
    goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and
    rewards of ownership. For more than 90 percent of our
    sales, this is at the time products are shipped to the customer,
    typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. The
    remaining sales, which are outside the U.S., are recorded at the
    point of delivery. Provisions for returns, rebates, and
    discounts are established in the same period the related sales
    are recorded.

We regularly review the supply levels of our significant
    products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major
    markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic
    inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and
    available prescription volume information for our products, or
    alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler
    inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or
    less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes
    of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or
    anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated
    changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday
    stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the
    U.S., the current structure of our arrangements eliminates the
    incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us
    improved data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we
    believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual
    increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared
    with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales
    discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product
    sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately
    quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. Wholesaler
    stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any
    material changes in the rate of actual product returns.

We establish sales return accruals for anticipated product
    returns. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive
    at our net sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed.
    Consistent with SFAS 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of
    Return Exists, we estimate a reserve when the sales occur for
    future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is
    primarily based on historical return rates as well as
    specifically identified anticipated returns due to known
    business conditions and product expiry dates. Actual product
    returns have been approximately one percent of our net sales
    over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly
    as a percent of sales.

We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same
    period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are
    recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales. Sales
    rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the
    establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care,
    Medicare, chargebacks, long-term-care, hospital, patient
    assistance programs, and various other government programs. We
    base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and
    discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the
    provisions of current rebate and discount contracts.

The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates
    associated with sales covered by Medicaid. In determining the
    appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid
    rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical
    sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, an
    evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and
    interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to
    Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate
    and discount contracts. Although we accrue a liability for
    Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the
    product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related

-34-

to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because
    of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate
    adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several
    periods.

Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or
    legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the
    same period as the related sales. In some large European
    countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated
    pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of
    these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise
    budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the
    related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual
    pharmaceutical budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves.

We believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and
    discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts
    and circumstances. Sales returns, federally mandated Medicaid
    rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs (Medicaid)
    and Medicare rebates reduced sales by $1.03 billion,
    $738.8 million, and $704.8 million in 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively. A 5 percent change in the sales return,
    Medicaid, and Medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2008
    would lead to an approximate $52 million effect on our
    income before income taxes. As of December 31, 2008, our
    sales returns, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate liability was
    $618.5 million.

Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales
    rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our
    global sales return liability is included in other current
    liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated
    balance sheet. Approximately 80 percent and 78 percent
    of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability
    resulted from sales of our products in the U.S. as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The following
    represents a roll-forward of our most significant
    U.S. returns, rebate, and discount liability balances,
    including Medicaid (in millions):

    presented.

Product
    Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies

Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by
    their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and
    probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product
    litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability
    amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation,
    the nature and the number of other similar current and past
    litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current
    assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the
    likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement
    discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product
    liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can
    formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate
    these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience
    and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs
    expected to be incurred in connection with significant product
    liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable.

We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the
    exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our
    insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and
    exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the
    insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and
    the possibility of and length of time for collection. In the
    past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining
    product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance
    market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently
    marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue
    to be completely self-insured for future product liability
    losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able
    to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future.

-35-

The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the
    related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on
    a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our
    consolidated balance sheets.

We believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we
    have established for product litigation liabilities and other
    contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and
    circumstances.

Pension
    and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions

Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate,
    retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree
    medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate,
    retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and
    health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a
    significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the
    analysis below, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information regarding our retirement
    benefits.

Periodically, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected
    return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree
    health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we
    consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount
    rates, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost
    trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions
    compared with actual results; an analysis of current market
    conditions and asset allocations (approximately 88 percent
    to 92 percent of which are growth investments); and the
    views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an
    actuarially determined, company-specific yield curve to
    determine the discount rate. In evaluating our expected
    retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of
    our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits
    together with our expectations of future retirement ages.

We believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are
    appropriate based upon the above factors. If the
    health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one
    percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service
    cost and interest cost components of the 2008 annual expense
    would increase by approximately $27 million. A
    one-percentage-point decrease would lower the aggregate of the
    2008 service cost and interest cost by approximately
    $21 million. If the 2008 discount rate for the
    U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit
    plans (U.S. plans) were to be changed by a quarter
    percentage point, income before income taxes would change by
    approximately $26 million. If the 2008 expected return on
    plan assets for U.S. plans were to be changed by a quarter
    percentage point, income before income taxes would change by
    approximately $17 million. If our assumption regarding the
    2008 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were
    adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be
    affected by approximately $28 million. The U.S. plans
    represent approximately 83 percent of the total accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligation and approximately
    84 percent of total plan assets at December 31, 2008.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both
    intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic
    basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We
    determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted
    cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value.
    If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the
    excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value,
    and the cost basis is adjusted. The estimated future cash flows,
    based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections,
    require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary
    from these estimates.

Income
    Taxes

We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of
    tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these
    judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business,
    our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing
    authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and
    penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties
    exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax
    law resulting from legislation, regulation,

and/or

as
    concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court
    systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
    position only if it is more likely than not that the tax
    position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
    authorities, based on the technical merits of the

-36-

position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial
    statements from such a position are measured based on the
    largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent
    likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in
    facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result
    from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance
    of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new
    information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of
    an examination. We believe that our estimates for uncertain tax
    positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that
    may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize
    both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in income tax expense.

We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our
    deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated
    from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in
    certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would
    more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have
    not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies
    in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where
    history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of
    tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or
    future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to
    the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of
    income tax expense.

We believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions
    and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are
    appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. A
    5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax
    positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change
    in net income of approximately $43.2 million and
    $42.3 million, respectively.

FINANCIAL
    EXPECTATIONS FOR 2009

For the full year of 2009, we expect earnings per share to be in
    the range of $4.00 to $4.25. We expect volume growth in sales
    again in 2009, driven by Cymbalta, Alimta, Cialis, Humalog, and
    the anticipated launches of prasugrel, as well as by the Elanco
    animal health division. However, the negative impact of weaker
    foreign currencies, worldwide pricing pressures, and the impact
    of generic competition in certain markets for Gemzar are
    anticipated to partially offset these positive impacts. As a
    result, we expect mid-single digit sales growth. We expect gross
    margin as a percent of net sales to increase, driven by the
    strengthening dollar. This increase could be more pronounced in
    the first half of 2009. Marketing, selling, and administrative
    expenses are expected to show flat to low-single digit growth.
    Research and development expenses are projected to grow in the
    low-double digits. Other — net is expected to be a net
    loss of between $200 million and $250 million. Capital
    expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion,
    and we expect continued strong operating cash flow.

Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among
    other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed
    products; developments with competitive products; the timing and
    scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product
    launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of
    compounds under development resulting in acquired in-process
    research and development charges; foreign exchange rates and
    global macroeconomic conditions; changes in effective tax rates;
    wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments,
    litigation, and government investigations; and the impact of
    governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and
    reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. We undertake no duty to
    update these forward-looking statements.

LEGAL AND
    REGULATORY MATTERS

We are a party to various legal actions and government
    investigations. The most significant of these are described
    below. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of
    these matters, we believe that, except as specifically noted
    below, the resolution of all such matters will not have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated
    results of operations in any one accounting period.

Patent
    Litigation

We are engaged in the following patent litigation matters
    brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch-Waxman Act
    (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of
    1984):

•

Cymbalta:

Sixteen generic drug manufacturers have
    submitted ANDAs seeking permission to market generic versions of
    Cymbalta prior to the expiration of our relevant
    U.S. patents (the earliest of which expires in 2013). Of
    these challengers, all allege non-infringement of the patent
    claims directed to the commercial formulation, and eight allege
    invalidity of the patent claims directed to the active
    ingredient duloxetine. Of the eight challengers to the compound
    patent claims, one further alleges invalidity of the claims
    directed to the use of Cymbalta for treating fibromyalgia, and
    one alleges the patent having claims directed to the active
    ingredient is unenforceable. Lawsuits have been filed in
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana
    against Activis Elizabeth LLC; Aurobindo Pharma Ltd.; Cobalt
    Laboratories, Inc.; Impax Laboratories, Inc.; Lupin Limited;
    Sandoz Inc.; Sun Pharma Global, Inc.; and Wockhardt Limited,
    seeking rulings that the patents are valid, infringed, and
    enforceable. Answers to the complaints are pending.

•

Gemzar:

Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sicor), Mayne Pharma
    (USA) Inc. (Mayne), and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun)
    each submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic
    versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant
    U.S. patents (compound patent expiring in 2010 and
    method-of-use patent expiring in 2013), and alleging that these
    patents are invalid. We filed lawsuits in the U.S. District
    Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Sicor
    (February 2006) and Mayne (October 2006 and January 2008),
    seeking rulings that these patents are valid and are being
    infringed. The suit against Sicor has been scheduled for trial
    in July 2009. Sicor’s ANDAs have been approved by the FDA;
    however, Sicor must provide 90 days notice prior to
    marketing generic Gemzar to allow time for us to seek a
    preliminary injunction. Both suits against Mayne have been
    administratively closed, and the parties have agreed to be bound
    by the results of the Sicor suit. In November 2007, Sun filed a
    declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court
    for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking rulings that our
    method-of-use and compound patents are invalid or unenforceable,
    or would not be infringed by the sale of Sun’s generic
    product. This trial is scheduled for December 2009.

•

Alimta:

Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc. (Teva) and APP
    Pharmaceuticals, LLC (APP) each submitted ANDAs seeking approval
    to market generic versions of Alimta prior to the expiration of
    the relevant U.S. patent (licensed from the Trustees of
    Princeton University and expiring in 2016), and alleging the
    patent is invalid. We, along with Princeton, filed lawsuits in
    the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
    against Teva and APP, seeking rulings that the compound patent
    is valid and infringed. Trial is scheduled for November 8,
    2010.

•

Evista:

Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr) submitted an ANDA
    in 2002 seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista
    prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents
    (expiring in

2012-2017)

and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or
    not infringed. In November 2002, we filed a lawsuit against Barr
    in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
    Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid,
    enforceable, and being infringed by Barr. Teva Pharmaceuticals
    USA, Inc. (Teva) has also submitted an ANDA seeking permission
    to market a generic version of Evista. In June 2006, we filed a
    similar lawsuit against Teva in the U.S. District Court for
    the Southern District of Indiana. The lawsuit against Teva is
    currently scheduled for trial beginning March 9, 2009,
    while no trial date has been set in the lawsuit against Barr. In
    April 2008, the FDA granted Teva tentative approval of its ANDA,
    but Teva’s ability to market a generic product is subject
    to a statutory stay, which has been extended to expire on
    March 9, 2009. If the stay expires and the company cannot
    obtain preliminary relief from the court, Teva can launch its
    generic product, regardless of the status of the current
    litigation, but subject to our right to recover damages, should
    we prevail at trial.

We believe each of these Hatch-Waxman challenges is without
    merit and expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is
    not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and
    accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail.
    An unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a
    material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity, and financial position.

We have received challenges to Zyprexa patents in a number of
    countries outside the U.S.:

•

In Canada, several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have
    challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and
    method-of-use patent (expiring in 2011). In April 2007, the
    Canadian Federal Court ruled against the first challenger,
    Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and that ruling was affirmed on appeal in
    February 2008. In June 2007, the Canadian Federal Court held
    that an invalidity allegation of a second challenger, Novopharm
    Ltd. (Novopharm), was justified and denied our request that
    Novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing approval for
    generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm began selling generic
    olanzapine in Canada in the third quarter of 2007. We sued
    Novopharm for patent infringement, and the trial began in
    November 2008. We expect the trial to run through the first
    quarter of 2009, with a decision in the second half of 2009. In
    November 2007, Apotex filed an action seeking a declaration of
    the invalidity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use
    patents, and no trial date has been set. We have brought similar
    actions against Pharmascience (August 2007), Sandoz (July 2007),
    Nu-Pharm (June 2008), Genpharm (June 2008) and Cobalt
    (January 2009); none of these suits has been scheduled for
    trial. Pharmascience has agreed to be bound by the outcome of
    the Novopharm suit, and, pending the outcome of the lawsuit, we
    have agreed not to take any further steps to prevent the company
    from coming to market with generic olanzapine tablets, subject
    to a contingent damages obligation should we be successful
    against Novopharm.

•

In Germany, generic pharmaceutical manufacturers
    Egis-Gyogyszergyar and Neolab Ltd. challenged the validity of
    our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent (expiring in
    2011). In June 2007, the German Federal Patent Court held that
    our patent is invalid. Generic olanzapine was launched by
    competitors in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2007. We
    appealed the decision to the German Federal Supreme Court and
    following a hearing in December 2008, the Supreme Court reversed
    the Federal Patent Court and found the patent to be valid.
    Following the decision of the Supreme Court, the generic
    companies either agreed to withdraw from the market or were
    subject to preliminary injunction. We are pursuing these
    companies for damages arising from infringement.

•

We have received challenges in a number of other countries,
    including Spain, the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, and several
    smaller European countries. In Spain, we have been successful at
    both the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the
    generic manufacturers’ challenges, but further legal
    challenge is now pending before the Commercial Court in Madrid.
    In the U.K., the generic pharmaceutical manufacturer
    Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (UK) Limited has challenged
    the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent
    (expiring in 2011). In October 2008, the Patents Court in the
    High Court, London ruled that our patent was valid.
    Dr. Reddy’s appealed this decision, and a hearing date
    for the appeal has not been set.

We are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our
    Zyprexa patents on a

country-by-country

basis. We cannot determine the outcome of this litigation. The
    availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could
    have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
    operations.

Xigris and Evista:

In June 2002, Ariad Pharmaceuticals,
    Inc., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Whitehead
    Institute for Biomedical Research, and the President and Fellows
    of Harvard College in the U.S. District Court for the
    District of Massachusetts sued us, alleging that sales of two of
    our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement
    of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling
    phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on past and
    future sales of these products. On May 4, 2006, a jury in
    Boston issued an initial decision in the case that Xigris and
    Evista sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the
    plaintiffs approximately $65 million in damages, calculated
    by applying a 2.3 percent royalty to all U.S. sales of
    Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent
    through the date of trial. In addition, a separate bench trial
    with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts was held in
    August 2006, on our contention that the patent is unenforceable
    and impermissibly covers natural processes. In June 2005, the
    United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) commenced a
    reexamination of the patent, and in August 2007 took the
    position that the Ariad claims at issue are unpatentable, a
    position that Ariad continues to contest. In September 2007, the
    Court entered a final judgment indicating that Ariad’s
    claims are patentable, valid, and enforceable, and finding
    damages in the amount of $65 million plus a
    2.3 percent royalty on net U.S. sales of Xigris
    and Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the
    Court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after
    all rights to appeal have been exhausted. We have appealed this

-39-

judgment. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard
    oral arguments on the appeal on February 6, 2009. We
    believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we
    will ultimately prevail on these issues, and therefore that the
    likelihood of any monetary damages is remote.

Government
    Investigations and Related Litigation

In March 2004, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the EDPA
    advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our
    U.S. marketing and promotional practices, including our
    communications with physicians and remuneration of physician
    consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and
    Prozac Weekly. In addition, the State Medicaid Fraud Control
    Units of more than 30 states coordinated with the EDPA in
    its investigation of any Medicaid-related claims relating to our
    marketing and promotion of Zyprexa. In January 2009, we
    announced that we reached resolution of this matter. As part of
    the resolution, we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of
    the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and agreed to pay
    $615.0 million. The misdemeanor plea is for the off-label
    promotion of Zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for
    dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia, between September
    1999 and March 2001. We have also entered into a settlement
    agreement resolving the federal civil claims, under which we
    will pay approximately $438.0 million, although we do not
    admit to the allegations. We have also agreed to settle the
    civil investigations brought by the State Medicaid Fraud Control
    Units of the states that have coordinated with the EDPA in its
    investigation, and will make available a maximum amount of
    approximately $362.0 million for payment to those states
    that agree to settle. The charge we recorded for this matter in
    the third quarter of $1.42 billion will be sufficient to
    cover these payments. Also, as part of the settlement, we have
    entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of
    Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health
    and Human Services (HHS). This agreement will require us to
    maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set of
    defined corporate integrity obligations for five years. The
    agreement also provides for an independent third-party review
    organization to assess and report on the company’s systems,
    processes, policies, procedures and practices.

In June 2005, we received a subpoena from the Office of the
    Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, of the State of
    Florida, seeking production of documents relating to sales of
    Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect
    to Zyprexa. In September 2006, we received a subpoena from the
    California Attorney General’s Office seeking production of
    documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain
    Zyprexa’s status on California’s formulary, marketing
    and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa, and
    remuneration of health care providers. We expect these matters
    to be resolved if Florida and California participate in the
    state component of the EDPA resolution.

Beginning in August 2006, we received civil investigative
    demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of
    states under various state consumer protection laws. Most of
    these requests became part of a multistate investigative effort
    coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general. In
    October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and
    the District of Columbia. While there is no finding that we have
    violated any provision of the state laws under which the
    investigations were conducted, we paid $62.0 million and
    agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding Zyprexa for a
    period of six years, through consent decrees filed in the
    settling states. The 32 states participating in the
    settlement are: Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida,
    Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland,
    Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey,
    New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
    Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
    Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Product
    Liability and Related Litigation

We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa
    product liability lawsuits in the U.S. and have been
    notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed
    suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the
    “claims”) allege a variety of injuries from the use of
    Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or
    contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims
    seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically
    accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side
    effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we
    improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the

-40-

federal lawsuits are part of a Multi-District Litigation
    (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the
    Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL
    No. 1596).

Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various
    claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product
    liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the
    claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 32,670
    claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits
    and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as
    follows:

•

In June 2005, we reached an agreement in principle (and in
    September 2005 a final agreement) to settle more than 8,000
    claims for $690.0 million plus $10.0 million to cover
    administration of the settlement.

•

In January 2007, we reached agreements with a number of
    plaintiffs’ attorneys to settle more than 18,000 claims for
    approximately $500 million.

The 2005 settlement totaling $700.0 million was paid during
    2005. The January 2007 settlements were paid during 2007.

We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in
    all remaining claims. The U.S. Zyprexa product liability
    claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 105
    lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 120 plaintiffs,
    of which about 80 cases covering about 90 plaintiffs are part of
    the MDL. No trials have been scheduled related to these claims.

In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits seeking class
    action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa.
    One of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of
    Quebec, and a second has been certified in Ontario and includes
    all Canadian residents except for residents of Quebec and
    British Columbia. The allegations in the Canadian actions are
    similar to those in the litigation pending in the U.S.

Since the beginning of 2005, we have recorded aggregate net
    pretax charges of $1.61 billion for Zyprexa product
    liability matters. The net charges, which take into account our
    actual insurance recoveries, covered the following:

•

The cost of the Zyprexa product liability settlements to
    date; and

•

Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs
    regarding the known Zyprexa product liability claims and
    expected future claims to the extent we could formulate a
    reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the
    claims.

In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in
    state court in Louisiana on behalf of the Louisiana Department
    of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or
    contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that
    we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have been removed
    to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the
    Eastern District of New York (EDNY). In these actions, the
    Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the costs it
    paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit
    programs, as well as the costs the department alleges it has
    incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. We
    have been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of
    Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Minnesota, Mississippi,
    Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and
    West Virginia in the courts of the respective states. The
    Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New
    Mexico, and West Virginia cases are part of the MDL proceedings
    in the EDNY. The Alaska case was settled in March 2008 for a
    payment of $15.0 million, plus terms designed to ensure,
    subject to certain limitations and conditions, that Alaska is
    treated as favorably as certain other states that may settle
    with us in the future over similar claims. The following cases
    have been set for trial in 2009: Connecticut in the EDNY in
    June, Pennsylvania in November, and South Carolina in August, in
    their respective states.

In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be
    nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and
    third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have
    made or will make payments for their members or insured patients
    being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been
    consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under
    certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil
    RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the
    cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and
    attorneys’ fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the
    EDNY in 2006 on similar grounds. In September

-41-

2008, Judge Weinstein certified a class consisting of
    third-party payors, excluding governmental entities and
    individual consumers. We appealed the certification order, and
    Judge Weinstein’s order denying our motion for summary
    judgment, in September 2008. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees
    Trust Fund brought claims in state court in Pennsylvania as
    insurer of Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed
    Zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the New York cases.
    As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that
    we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of
    Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. The Pennsylvania case
    is set for trial in October 2009.

We cannot determine with certainty the additional number of
    lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. The ultimate
    resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation
    could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results
    of operations, liquidity, and financial position.

In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other
    product liability lawsuits involving primarily
    diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thimerosal. The majority of these
    claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and
    coverage limits.

Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible
    that we could become subject to large numbers of product
    liability and related claims for other products in the future.
    In the past few years, we have experienced difficulties in
    obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive
    insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our
    currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we
    will continue to be completely self-insured for future product
    liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we
    will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the

Segment
    Information

We operate in one significant business segment — human
    pharmaceutical products. Operations of the animal health
    business segment are not material and share many of the same
    economic and operating characteristics as human pharmaceutical
    products. Therefore, they are included with pharmaceutical
    products for purposes of segment reporting.

Net sales are attributed to the countries based on the location
    of the customer.

The largest category of products is the neurosciences group,
    which includes Zyprexa, Cymbalta, Strattera, and Prozac.
    Endocrinology products consist primarily of Humalog, Humulin,
    Byetta, Actos, Evista, Forteo, and Humatrope. Oncology products
    consist primarily of Gemzar and Alimta. Cardiovascular products
    consist primarily of Cialis, ReoPro, and Xigris. Animal health
    products include Posilac, Tylan, Rumensin, Coban, and other
    products for livestock and poultry, and Comfortis and other
    products for companion animals. The other pharmaceuticals
    category includes anti-infectives, primarily Ceclor and
    Vancocin, and other miscellaneous pharmaceutical products and
    services.

Most of our pharmaceutical products are distributed through
    wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other health
    care professionals, and hospitals. In 2008, our three largest
    wholesalers each accounted for between 12 percent and
    16 percent of consolidated net sales. Further, they each
    accounted for between 10 percent and 15 percent of
    accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008. Animal health
    products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors.

Our business segments are distinguished by the ultimate end user
    of the product: humans or animals. Performance is evaluated
    based on profit or loss from operations before income taxes. The
    accounting policies of the individual segments are substantially
    the same as those described in the summary of significant
    accounting policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements. Income before income taxes for the animal health
    business was approximately $192 million, $173 million,
    and $184 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

-47-

The assets of the animal health business are intermixed with
    those of the pharmaceutical products business. Long-lived assets
    disclosed above consist of property and equipment and certain
    sundry assets.

We are exposed to the risk of changes in social, political, and
    economic conditions inherent in foreign operations, and our
    results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are
    affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Our common stock is listed on the New York, London, and Swiss

We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million in 2008, despite
    having a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion. Our net
    loss was driven by the $4.69 billion acquired IPR&D
    charge for ImClone in the fourth quarter and the
    $1.48 billion Zyprexa investigation settlements recorded in
    the third quarter. The IPR&D charge was not tax deductible,
    and only a portion of the Zyprexa investigation settlements was
    deductible. In addition, we recorded tax expense associated with
    the ImClone acquisition in the fourth quarter, as well as a
    discrete income tax benefit of $210.3 million in the first
    quarter for the resolution of the IRS audit.

Zyprexa investigation settlements. The IPR&D charge was not
    tax deductible, and only a portion of the Zyprexa investigation
    settlements was deductible. In addition, we recorded tax expense
    associated with the ImClone acquisition, as well as a discrete
    income tax benefit of $210.3 million for the resolution of
    the IRS audit.


The increase reflects the in-process research and development
    expense of $4.69 billion associated with the ImClone
    acquisition and $1.48 billion associated with the Zyprexa

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

ELI LILLY AND COMPANY AND
    SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except
    per-share data)

Note 1:

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation:

The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting practices generally accepted in the United States
    (GAAP). The accounts of all wholly owned and majority-owned
    subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
    statements. Where our ownership of consolidated subsidiaries is
    less than 100 percent, the outside shareholders’
    interests are reflected in other noncurrent liabilities. All
    intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
    expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial
    statements and during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

All per-share amounts, unless otherwise noted in the footnotes,
    are presented on a diluted basis, that is, based on the
    weighted-average number of outstanding common shares plus the
    effect of dilutive stock options and other incremental shares.

Cash equivalents:

We consider all highly liquid
    investments with a maturity of three months or less from the
    date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The cost of these
    investments approximates fair value. Included in cash
    equivalents at December 31, 2008, is restricted cash of
    $339.0 million related to the debt assumed with the ImClone
    acquisition, which is expected to be paid in the first quarter
    of 2009.

Inventories:

We state all inventories at the lower of
    cost or market. We use the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of our inventories
    located in the continental United States, or approximately
    45 percent of our total inventories. Other inventories are
    valued by the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method. FIFO cost approximates current
    replacement cost. Inventories at December 31 consisted of the
    following:

Investments:

Substantially all of our investments in debt
    and marketable equity securities are classified as
    available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at
    fair value with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax,
    reported in other comprehensive income. Unrealized losses
    considered to be other-than-temporary are recognized in
    earnings. Factors we consider in making this evaluation include
    company-specific drivers of the decrease in fair value, status
    of projects in development, near-term prospects of the issuer,
    the length of time the value has been depressed, and the
    financial condition of the industry. We do not evaluate
    cost-method investments for impairment unless there is an
    indicator of impairment. We review these investments for
    indicators of impairment on a regular basis. Realized gains and
    losses on sales of available-for-sale securities are computed
    based upon specific identification of the initial cost adjusted
    for any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Investments
    in companies over which we have significant influence but not a
    controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method
    with our share of earnings or losses reported in
    other — net. We own no investments that are considered
    to be trading securities.

Risk-management instruments:

Our derivative activities
    are initiated within the guidelines of documented corporate
    risk-management policies and do not create additional risk
    because gains and losses on derivative

-52-

contracts offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities,
    and transactions being hedged. As derivative contracts are
    initiated, we designate the instruments individually as either a
    fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Management reviews the
    correlation and effectiveness of our derivatives on a quarterly
    basis.

For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair
    value hedges, the derivative instrument is marked to market with
    gains and losses recognized currently in income to offset the
    respective losses and gains recognized on the underlying
    exposure. For derivative contracts that are designated and
    qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of gains and
    losses on these contracts is reported as a component of other
    comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same
    period the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge
    ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings.
    Derivative contracts that are not designated as hedging
    instruments are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss
    recognized in current earnings during the period of change.

We may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts
    to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates
    (principally the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen).
    Foreign currency derivatives used for hedging are put in place
    using the same or like currencies and duration as the underlying
    exposures. Forward contracts are principally used to manage
    exposures arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and
    receivables denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts
    are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in
    other — net. The purchased option contracts are used
    to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily
    intercompany inventory activities expected to occur within the
    next year. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of
    those future transactions and the impact on earnings is included
    in cost of sales. We may enter into foreign currency forward
    contracts and currency swaps as fair value hedges of firm
    commitments. Forward and option contracts generally have
    maturities not exceeding 12 months.

In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to
    fluctuations in interest rates. These fluctuations can vary the
    costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a
    portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk
    management that includes the use of derivative financial
    instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to
    limit the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on earnings.
    Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in
    short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to
    manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an
    acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt and
    investment positions and may enter into interest rate swaps or
    collars to help maintain that balance. Interest rate swaps or
    collars that convert our fixed-rate debt or investments to a
    floating rate are designated as fair value hedges of the
    underlying instruments. Interest rate swaps or collars that
    convert floating rate debt or investments to a fixed rate are
    designated as cash flow hedges. Interest expense on the debt is
    adjusted to include the payments made or received under the swap
    agreements.

Goodwill and other intangibles:

Goodwill is not
    amortized. All other intangibles arising from acquisitions and
    research alliances have finite lives and are amortized over
    their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 20 years,
    using the straight-line method. The weighted-average
    amortization period for developed product technology is
    approximately 12 years. Amortization expense for 2008,
    2007, and 2006 was $193.4 million, $172.8 million, and
    $7.6 million before tax, respectively. The estimated
    amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years
    approximates $280 million before tax, per year.
    Substantially all of the amortization expense is included in
    cost of sales. See Note 3 for further discussion of
    goodwill and other intangibles acquired in 2008 and 2007.

Goodwill and net other intangibles are reviewed to assess
    recoverability at least annually and when certain impairment
    indicators are present. No significant impairments occurred with
    respect to the carrying value of our goodwill or other
    intangible assets in 2008, 2007, or 2006.

Property and equipment:

Property and equipment is stated
    on the basis of cost. Provisions for depreciation of buildings
    and equipment are computed generally by the straight-line method
    at rates based on their estimated useful lives (12 to
    50 years for buildings and 3 to 18 years for
    equipment). We review the carrying value of long-lived assets
    for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events
    or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an
    asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is determined by
    comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by
    the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified,
    a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net
    book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.

At December 31, property and equipment consisted of the
    following:

Depreciation expense for 2008, 2007, and 2006 was
    $731.7 million, $682.3 million, and
    $627.4 million, respectively. Approximately
    $48.2 million, $95.3 million, and $106.7 million
    of interest costs were capitalized as part of property and
    equipment in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Total rental
    expense for all leases, including contingent rentals (not
    material), amounted to approximately $327.4 million,
    $294.2 million, and $293.6 million for 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively. Assets under capital leases included in
    property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets,
    capital lease obligations entered into, and future minimum
    rental commitments are not material.

Litigation and environmental liabilities:

Litigation
    accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated
    insurance recoverables are reflected on a gross basis as
    liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated
    balance sheets. With respect to the product liability claims
    currently asserted against us, we have accrued for our estimated
    exposures to the extent they are both probable and estimable
    based on the information available to us. We accrue for certain
    product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we
    can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate
    these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience
    and data regarding product usage. Legal defense costs expected
    to be incurred in connection with significant product liability
    loss contingencies are accrued when probable and reasonably
    estimable. A

-54-

portion of the costs associated with defending and disposing of
    these suits is covered by insurance. We record receivables for
    insurance-related recoveries when it is probable they will be
    realized. These receivables are classified as a reduction of the
    litigation charges on the statement of income. We estimate
    insurance recoverables based on existing deductibles, coverage
    limits, our assessment of any defenses to coverage that might be
    raised by the carriers, and the existing and projected future
    level of insolvencies among the insurance carriers. However, for
    substantially all of our currently marketed products, we are
    completely self-insured for future product liability losses.

Revenue recognition:

We recognize revenue from sales of
    products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the
    buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. For more than
    90 percent of our sales, this is at the time products are
    shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale distributor or a
    major retail chain. The remaining sales are recorded at the
    point of delivery. Provisions for returns, discounts, and
    rebates are established in the same period the related sales are
    recorded.

We also generate income as a result of collaboration agreements.
    Revenue from co-promotion services is based upon net sales
    reported by our co-promotion partners and, if applicable, the
    number of sales calls we perform. Initial fees we receive from
    the partnering of our compounds under development are amortized
    through the expected product approval date. Initial fees
    received from out-licensing agreements that include both the
    sale of marketing rights to our commercialized products and a
    related commitment to supply the products are generally
    recognized as net sales over the term of the supply agreement.
    We immediately recognize the full amount of milestone payments
    due to us upon the achievement of the milestone event if the
    event is substantive, objectively determinable, and represents
    an important point in the development life cycle of the
    pharmaceutical product. Milestone payments earned by us are
    generally recorded in other — net.

Royalty revenue from licensees, which are based on third-party
    sales of licensed products and technology, are recorded as
    earned in accordance with the contract terms when third-party
    sales can be reasonably measured and collection of the funds is
    reasonably assured. This royalty revenue is included in net
    sales.

Acquired research and development:

We recognize as
    incurred the cost of directly acquiring assets to be used in the
    research and development process that have not yet received
    regulatory approval for marketing and for which no alternative
    future use has been identified. Once the product has obtained
    regulatory approval, we capitalize the milestones paid and
    amortize them over the period benefited. Milestones paid prior
    to regulatory approval of the product are generally expensed
    when the event requiring payment of the milestone occurs.

    the following:

The joint venture income represents our share of the Lilly ICOS
    LLC joint venture results of operations, net of income taxes. We
    acquired the outstanding ownership of the joint venture in
    January 2007 as a result of our acquisition of ICOS. See
    Note 3 for further discussion.

Income taxes:

Deferred taxes are recognized for the
    future tax effects of temporary differences between financial
    and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates.
    Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income
    of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the
    United States and be taxable.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only
    if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the
    technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
    the financial statements from such a position are measured based
    on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent
    likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

-55-

Earnings per share:

We calculate basic earnings per share
    based on the weighted-average number of outstanding common
    shares and incremental shares. We calculate diluted earnings per
    share based on the weighted-average number of outstanding common
    shares plus the effect of dilutive stock options and other
    incremental shares. See Note 11 for further discussion.

Stock-based compensation:

We recognize the fair value of
    stock-based compensation as expense over the requisite service
    period of the individual grantees, which generally equals the
    vesting period. Under our policy all stock-based awards are
    approved prior to the date of grant. The Compensation Committee
    of the Board of Directors approves the value of the award and
    date of grant. Stock-based compensation that is awarded as part
    of our annual equity grant is made on a specific grant date
    scheduled in advance.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications have been
    made to the December 31, 2007 and 2006 consolidated
    financial statements and accompanying notes to conform with the
    December 31, 2008 presentation.

Note 2:

Implementation
    of New Financial Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 applies to
    all derivative instruments and related hedged items accounted
    for under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities. This Statement requires
    entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an
    entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments
    and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133
    and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments
    and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial
    position, results of operations, and cash flows. This Statement
    is effective for us January 1, 2009.

We adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
    Issue

No. 07-3

(EITF 07-3),

Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or
    Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development
    Activities, on January 1, 2008. Pursuant to

EITF 07-3,

nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will
    be used or rendered for future research and development
    activities should be deferred and capitalized. Such amounts
    should be recognized as an expense when the related goods are
    delivered or services are performed, or when the goods or
    services are no longer expected to be received. This Issue is to
    be applied prospectively for contracts entered into on or after
    the effective date.

We adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 157
    (SFAS 157), Fair Value Measurements, on January 1,
    2008. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework
    for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. The implementation of this Statement
    was not material to our consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB revised and issued Statement
    No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)).
    SFAS 141(R) changes how the acquisition method is applied
    in accordance with SFAS 141. The primary revisions to this
    Statement require an acquirer in a business combination to
    measure assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date,
    at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions
    specified in the Statement. This Statement also requires the
    acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages to
    recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as
    the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts
    of their fair values (or other amounts determined in accordance
    with the Statement). Assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    arising from contractual contingencies as of the acquisition
    date are to be measured at their acquisition-date fair values,
    and assets or liabilities arising from all other contingencies
    as of the acquisition date are to be measured at their
    acquisition-date fair value, only if it is more likely than not
    that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability in FASB
    Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements.
    This Statement significantly amends other Statements and
    authoritative guidance, including FASB Interpretation
    No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to
    Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, and
    now requires the capitalization of research and development
    assets acquired in a business combination at their
    acquisition-date fair values, separately from goodwill.
    SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, was also
    amended by this Statement to require the acquirer to recognize
    changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are
    recognizable because of a business combination either in income
    from continuing operations in the period of the combination or
    directly

-56-

in contributed capital, depending on the circumstances. This
    Statement is effective for us for business combinations for
    which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009.

In December 2007, in conjunction with SFAS 141(R), the FASB
    issued Statement No. 160, Accounting for Noncontrolling
    Interests. This Statement amends Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements
    (ARB 51), by requiring companies to report a noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary as equity in its consolidated financial
    statements. Disclosure of the amounts of consolidated net income
    attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest will
    be required. This Statement also clarifies that transactions
    that result in a change in a parent’s ownership interest in
    a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation will be
    treated as equity transactions, while a gain or loss will be
    recognized by the parent when a subsidiary is deconsolidated.
    This Statement is effective for us January 1, 2009, and we
    do not anticipate the implementation will be material to our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the
    EITF on Issue

No. 07-1

(EITF 07-1),

Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements.

EITF 07-1

defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting
    requirements for transactions between participants in a
    collaborative arrangement and between participants in the
    arrangement and third parties. This Issue is effective for us
    beginning January 1, 2009 and will be applied
    retrospectively to all prior periods presented for all
    collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date.
    The implementation of this Issue will not be material to our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN)
    No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on
    January 1, 2007. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return. See Note 12 for further
    discussion of the impact of adopting this Interpretation.

Note 3:

Acquisitions

During 2008 and 2007, we acquired several businesses. These
    acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations under
    the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method of
    accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were
    recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition
    date in our consolidated financial statements. The determination
    of estimated fair value required management to make significant
    estimates and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over
    the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, has
    been recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these
    acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial
    statements from the date of acquisition.

Most of these acquisitions included in-process research and
    development (IPR&D), which represented compounds, new
    indications, or line extensions under development that had not
    yet achieved regulatory approval for marketing. There are
    several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair
    value of the IPR&D acquired in a business combination. We
    utilized the “income method,” which applies a
    probability weighting to the estimated future net cash flows
    that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated
    costs. These projections are based on factors such as relevant
    market size, patent protection, historical pricing of similar
    products, and expected industry trends. The estimated future net
    cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an
    appropriate discount rate. This analysis is performed for each
    project independently. In accordance with FIN 4,
    Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business
    Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, these
    acquired IPR&D intangible assets totaling
    $4.71 billion and $340.5 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, were expensed immediately subsequent to the
    acquisition because the products had no alternative future use.
    The ongoing activities with respect to each of these products in
    development are not material to our research and development
    expenses.

In addition to the acquisitions of businesses, we also acquired
    several products in development. The acquired IPR&D related
    to these products of $122.0 million and $405.1 million
    in 2008 and 2007, respectively, was also written off by a charge
    to income immediately upon acquisition because the products had
    no alternative future use.

-57-

ImClone
    Acquisition

On November 24, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding
    shares of ImClone Systems Inc. (ImClone), a biopharmaceutical
    company focused on advancing oncology care, for a total purchase
    price of approximately $6.5 billion, which was financed
    through borrowings. This strategic combination will offer both
    targeted therapies and oncolytic agents along with a pipeline
    spanning all phases of clinical development. The combination
    also expands our biotechnology capabilities.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination
    under the purchase method of accounting, resulting in goodwill
    of $419.5 million. No portion of this goodwill is expected
    to be deductible for tax purposes.

Allocation
    of Purchase Price

We are currently determining the fair values of a significant
    portion of these net assets. The purchase price has been
    preliminarily allocated based on an estimate of the fair value
    of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of
    acquisition. The final determination of these fair values will
    be completed as soon as possible but no later than one year from
    the acquisition date. Although the final determination may
    result in asset and liability fair values that are different
    than the preliminary estimates of these amounts included herein,
    it is not expected that those differences will be material to
    our financial results.

This intangible asset will be
    amortized on a straight-line basis through 2023 in the U.S. and
    2018 in the rest of the world.

All of the estimated fair value of the acquired IPR&D is
    attributable to oncology-related products in development,
    including $1.33 billion to line extensions for Erbitux. A
    significant portion (81 percent) of the remaining value of
    acquired IPR&D is attributable to two compounds in
    Phase III clinical testing and one compound in
    Phase II clinical testing, all targeted to treat various
    forms of cancers. The discount rate we used in valuing the
    acquired IPR&D projects was 13.5 percent, and the
    charge for acquired IPR&D of $4.69 billion recorded in
    the fourth quarter of 2008, was not deductible for tax purposes.

Pro
    Forma Financial Information

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents
    the combined results of our operations with ImClone as if the
    acquisition and the financing for the acquisition had occurred
    as of the beginning of each of the years presented. We have
    adjusted the historical consolidated financial information to
    give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable
    to the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma financial
    information is not necessarily indicative of what our
    consolidated results of operations actually would have been had
    we completed the acquisition at the beginning of each year. In
    addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information does not
    attempt to project the future results of operations of our
    combined company.

The unaudited pro forma financial
    information above excludes the non-recurring charge incurred for
    acquired IPR&D of $4.69 billion and other
    merger-related costs.

The unaudited pro forma financial information above reflects the
    following:

•

a reduction of the amortization of ImClone’s deferred
    income of $86.2 million (2008) and $98.4 million
    (2007);

•

the increase of amortization expense of $78.8 million in
    2008 and 2007 related to the estimated fair value of
    identifiable intangible assets from the purchase price
    allocation which are being amortized over their estimated useful
    lives through 2023 in the U.S. and through 2018 in the rest
    of the world. The change in depreciation expense related to the
    change in the estimated fair value of property and equipment
    from the book value at the time of the acquisition was not
    material;

•

the adjustment to increase interest expense related to the debt
    incurred to finance the acquisition and the adjustment to
    decrease interest income related to the lost interest income on
    the cash used to purchase ImClone by a total of
    $301.0 million in 2008 and 2007;

•

the reduction of ImClone’s income tax expense to provide
    for income taxes at the statutory tax rate and the adjustment to
    income taxes for pro forma adjustments at the statutory tax
    rate, totaling $139.3 million (2008) and
    $189.5 million (2007). This excludes the acquired
    IPR&D charge of $4.69 billion, which was not tax
    deductible;

•

certain reclassifications to conform to accounting policies and
    classifications that are consistent with our practices (e.g.,
    ImClone’s license fees and milestones were classified as
    other — net, rather than net sales).

Posilac

On October 1, 2008, we acquired the worldwide rights to the
    dairy cow supplement Posilac, as well as the product’s
    supporting operations, from Monsanto Company (Monsanto). The
    acquisition of Posilac provides us with a product that
    complements those of our animal health business. Under the terms
    of the agreement, we acquired the rights to the Posilac brand,
    as well as the product’s U.S. sales force and
    manufacturing facility, for an aggregate purchase price of
    $403.9 million, which includes a $300.0 million
    upfront payment, transaction costs, and an accrual for
    contingent consideration to Monsanto based on estimated future
    Posilac sales for which payment is considered likely beyond a
    reasonable doubt.

This acquisition has been accounted for as a business
    combination under the purchase method of accounting. We
    allocated $204.3 million to identifiable intangible assets
    related to Posilac, $167.6 million to inventories, and
    $99.5 million of the purchase price to property and
    equipment. We also assumed $67.5 million of liabilities.
    Substantially all of the identifiable intangible assets are
    being amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives of
    20 years. The amount allocated to each of the intangible
    assets acquired is deductible for tax purposes.

SGX
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

On August 20, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock of SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SGX), a collaboration
    partner since 2003. The acquisition allows us to integrate
    SGX’s structure-guided drug discovery platform into our
    drug discovery efforts. It also gives us access to
    FAST

tm

,

    SGX’s fragment-based, protein structure guided drug
    discovery technology, and to a portfolio of preclinical oncology
    compounds focused on a number of kinase targets. Under the terms
    of the agreement, the outstanding shares of SGX common stock
    were redeemed for an aggregate purchase price, including
    transaction costs, of $66.8 million.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination
    under the purchase method of accounting. We allocated
    $29.6 million of the purchase price to deferred tax assets
    and $28.0 million to acquired IPR&D. The acquired
    IPR&D charge of $28.0 million was recorded in the
    third quarter of 2008 and was not deductible for tax purposes.

ICOS
    Corporation

On January 29, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock of ICOS Corporation (ICOS), our partner in the
    Lilly ICOS LLC joint venture for the manufacture and sale of
    Cialis for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The
    acquisition brought the full value of Cialis to us and enabled
    us to realize operational efficiencies in the further
    development, marketing, and selling of this product. The
    aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion
    was financed through borrowings.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination
    under the purchase method of accounting, resulting in goodwill
    of $646.7 million. No portion of this goodwill was
    deductible for tax purposes.

We determined the following estimated fair values for the assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.

This intangible asset will be
    amortized over the remaining expected patent lives of Cialis in
    each country; patent expiry dates range from 2015 to 2017.

New indications for and formulations of the Cialis compound in
    clinical testing at the time of the acquisition represented
    approximately 48 percent of the estimated fair value of the
    acquired IPR&D. The remaining value of acquired IPR&D
    represented several other products in development, with no one
    asset comprising a significant portion of this value. The
    discount rate we used in valuing the acquired IPR&D
    projects was 20 percent, and the charge for acquired
    IPR&D of $303.5 million recorded in the first quarter
    of 2007 was not deductible for tax purposes.

Other
    Acquisitions

During the second quarter of 2007, we acquired all of the
    outstanding stock of both Hypnion, Inc. (Hypnion), a privately
    held neuroscience drug discovery company focused on sleep
    disorders, and Ivy Animal Health, Inc. (Ivy), a privately held
    applied research and pharmaceutical product development company
    focused on the animal health industry, for $445.0 million
    in cash.

-60-

The acquisition of Hypnion provided us with a broader and more
    substantive presence in the area of sleep disorder research and
    ownership of HY10275, a novel Phase II compound with a dual
    mechanism of action aimed at promoting better sleep onset and
    sleep maintenance. This was Hypnion’s only significant
    asset. For this acquisition, we recorded an acquired IPR&D
    charge of $291.1 million, which was not deductible for tax
    purposes. Because Hypnion was a development-stage company, the
    transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather
    than as a business combination and, therefore, goodwill was not
    recorded.

The acquisition of Ivy provides us with products that complement
    those of our animal health business. This acquisition has been
    accounted for as a business combination under the purchase
    method of accounting. We allocated $88.7 million of the
    purchase price to other identifiable intangible assets,
    primarily related to marketed products, $37.0 million to
    acquired IPR&D, and $25.0 million to goodwill. The
    other identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over
    their estimated remaining useful lives of 10 to 20 years.
    The $37.0 million allocated to acquired IPR&D was
    charged to expense in the second quarter of 2007. Goodwill
    resulting from this acquisition was fully allocated to the
    animal health business segment. The amount allocated to each of
    the intangible assets acquired, including goodwill of
    $25.0 million and the acquired IPR&D of
    $37.0 million, was deductible for tax purposes.

Product
    Acquisitions

In June 2008, we entered into a licensing and development
    agreement with TransPharma Medical Ltd. (TransPharma) to acquire
    rights to its product and related drug delivery system for the
    treatment of osteoporosis. The product, which is administered
    transdermally using TransPharma’s proprietary technology,
    was in Phase II clinical testing, and had no alternative
    future use. Under the arrangement, we also gained non-exclusive
    access to TransPharma’s ViaDerm drug delivery system for
    the product. As with many development-phase products, launch of
    the product, if approved, was not expected in the near term. The
    charge of $35.0 million for acquired IPR&D related to
    this arrangement was included as expense in the second quarter
    of 2008 and is deductible for tax purposes.

In January 2008, our agreement with BioMS Medical Corp. to
    acquire the rights to its compound for the treatment of multiple
    sclerosis became effective. At the inception of this agreement,
    this compound was in the development stage (Phase III
    clinical trials) and had no alternative future use. As with many
    development-phase compounds, launch of the product, if approved,
    was not expected in the near term. The charge of
    $87.0 million for acquired IPR&D related to this
    arrangement was included as expense in the first quarter of 2008
    and is deductible for tax purposes.

In October 2007, we entered into an agreement with Glenmark
    Pharmaceuticals Limited India to acquire the rights to a
    portfolio of transient receptor potential vanilloid sub-family 1
    (TRPV 1) antagonist molecules, including a clinical-phase
    compound. The compound was in early clinical phase development
    as a potential next-generation treatment for various pain
    conditions, including osteoarthritic pain, and had no
    alternative future use. As with many development-phase
    compounds, launch of the product, if approved, was not expected
    in the near term. The charge of $45.0 million for acquired
    IPR&D was deductible for tax purposes and was included as
    expense in the fourth quarter of 2007. Development of this
    compound has been suspended.

In October 2007, we entered into a global strategic alliance
    with MacroGenics, Inc. (MacroGenics) to develop and
    commercialize teplizumab, a humanized anti-CD3 monoclonal
    antibody, as well as other potential next-generation anti-CD3
    molecules for use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. As
    part of the arrangement, we acquired the exclusive rights to the
    molecule, which was in the development stage (Phase II/III
    clinical trial for individuals with recent-onset type 1
    diabetes) and had no alternative future use. As with many
    development-phase compounds, launch of the product, if approved,
    was not expected in the near term. The charge of
    $44.0 million for acquired IPR&D was deductible for
    tax purposes and was included as expense in the fourth quarter
    of 2007.

In January 2007, we entered into an agreement with OSI
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to acquire the rights to its compound for
    the treatment of type 2 diabetes. At the inception of this
    agreement, this compound was in the development stage (Phase I
    clinical trials) and had no alternative future use. As with many
    development-phase compounds, launch of the product, if approved,
    was not expected in the near term. The charge of
    $25.0 million

-61-

for acquired IPR&D related to this arrangement was included
    as expense in the first quarter of 2007 and was deductible for
    tax purposes.

In connection with these arrangements, our partners are
    generally entitled to future milestones and royalties based on
    sales should these products be approved for commercialization.

Note 4:

Collaborations

We often enter into collaborative arrangements to develop and
    commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities might
    include research and development, marketing and selling
    (including promotional activities and physician detailing),
    manufacturing, and distribution. These collaborations often
    require milestone and royalty or profit share payments,
    contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked
    to the success of the asset in development, as well as expense
    reimbursements or payments to the third party. Each
    collaboration is unique in nature and our more significant
    arrangements are discussed below.

Erbitux

Prior to our acquisition, ImClone entered into several
    collaborations with respect to Erbitux, a product approved to
    fight cancer, while still in its development phase. The most
    significant collaborations operate in these geographic
    territories: the U.S., Japan, and Canada (Bristol-Myers Squibb);
    and worldwide except the U.S. and Canada (Merck KGaA). The
    agreements are expected to expire in 2018, upon which all of the
    rights with respect to Erbitux in the U.S. and Canada
    return to us.

Bristol-Myers
    Squibb Company

Pursuant to a commercial agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb
    Company and E.R. Squibb (collectively, BMS), relating to
    Erbitux, ImClone is co-developing and co-promoting Erbitux in
    North America with BMS, and is co-developing and co-promoting
    Erbitux in Japan with BMS. The companies had jointly agreed to
    expand the investment in the ongoing clinical development plan
    for Erbitux to further explore its use in additional tumor
    types. Under this arrangement, Erbitux research and development
    and other costs, up to threshold amounts, are the sole
    responsibility of BMS, with costs in excess of the thresholds
    shared by both companies according to a predetermined ratio.

Responsibilities associated with clinical and other ongoing
    studies are apportioned between the parties as determined
    pursuant to the agreement. Collaborative reimbursements received
    by ImClone for supply of product for research and development,
    for a portion of royalty expenses, and for a portion of
    marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, are recorded as
    a reduction to the respective expense line items on the
    consolidated statement of operations. Royalty expense paid to
    third parties is included in costs of sales. We receive a
    distribution fee in the form of a royalty from BMS, based on a
    percentage of net sales in the U.S. and Canada, which is
    recorded in net sales.

We are responsible for the manufacture and supply of all
    requirements of Erbitux in bulk-form active pharmaceutical
    ingredient (API) for clinical and commercial use in the
    territory, and BMS will purchase all of its requirements of API
    for commercial use from us, subject to certain stipulations per
    the agreement. Sales of Erbitux to BMS for commercial use are
    reported in net sales.

Merck
    KGaA

A development and license agreement between ImClone and Merck
    KGaA (Merck) with respect to Erbitux granted Merck exclusive
    rights to market Erbitux outside of North America and
    co-exclusive rights with BMS in Japan. Merck also has rights to
    manufacture Erbitux for supply in its territory. We manufacture
    and provide a portion of Merck’s requirements for API; we
    also receive a royalty on the sales of Erbitux outside of the
    U.S. and Canada, both of which are included in net sales as
    earned. Collaborative reimbursements received for supply of
    product for research and development, reimbursement of a portion
    of royalty expense, and marketing, selling, and administrative
    expenses are recorded as a reduction to the respective expense
    line items on the consolidated statement of operations. Royalty
    expense paid to third parties is included in cost of sales.

-62-

Exenatide

We are in a collaborative arrangement with Amylin
    Pharmaceuticals (Amylin) for the joint development, marketing,
    and selling of Byetta and other forms of exenatide such as
    exenatide once weekly. Byetta (exenatide injection) is presently
    approved as an adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in
    patients with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved adequate
    glycemic control using metformin, a sulfonylurea

and/or

a
    thiazolidinediene (U.S. only), three common oral therapies
    for type 2 diabetes. Lilly and Amylin are co-promoting exenatide
    in the U.S. Amylin is responsible for manufacturing and
    primarily utilizes third-party contract manufacturing
    organizations to supply Byetta. However, Lilly is manufacturing
    Byetta pen delivery devices for Amylin. Lilly is responsible for
    development and commercialization costs outside the U.S.

Under the terms of our collaboration with Amylin, we report as
    revenue our 50 percent share of gross margin on sales in
    the U.S., 100 percent of sales outside the U.S., and our
    sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin. We recorded
    revenues of $396.1 million, $330.7 million, and
    $219.0 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, for
    Byetta. We pay Amylin a percentage of the gross margin of
    exenatide sales outside of the U.S., and these costs are
    recorded in cost of sales. Under the


/


profit-sharing arrangement for the U.S., in addition to
    recording as revenue our 50 percent share of
    exenatide’s gross margin, we also report 50 percent of
    U.S. research and development costs, and marketing and
    selling costs in the research and development and marketing,
    selling, and administrative line items, respectively, on the
    consolidated statements of income.

Exenatide once weekly is presently in Phase III clinical
    trials and has not received regulatory approval. Amylin is
    constructing and will operate a manufacturing facility for
    exenatide once weekly, and we have entered into a supply
    agreement in which Amylin will supply exenatide once weekly
    product to us for sales outside the U.S. The estimated
    total cost of the facility is approximately $550 million.
    In 2008, we paid $125.0 million to Amylin, which we will
    amortize to cost of sales over the estimated life of the supply
    agreement beginning with product launch. We would be required to
    reimburse Amylin for a portion of any future impairment of this
    facility, recognized in accordance with GAAP. A portion of the
    $125.0 million payment we made to Amylin would be
    creditable against any amount we would owe as a result of
    impairment. We have also agreed to loan up to
    $165.0 million to Amylin at an indexed rate beginning
    December 1, 2009, and any borrowings have to be repaid by
    June 30, 2014.

Cymbalta

Boehringer
    Ingelheim

We are in a collaborative arrangement with Boehringer Ingelheim
    (BI) to market and promote Cymbalta, a product for the treatment
    of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic
    pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia, outside
    the U.S. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we
    generally share equally in development, marketing, and selling
    expenses, and pay BI a commission on sales in the co-promotional
    territories. We manufacture the product for all territories.

Collaborative reimbursements or payments for the cost sharing of
    marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are recorded in
    the respective expense line items in the consolidated statement
    of operations. The commission paid to BI is recognized in
    marketing, selling, and administrative expenses.

Quintiles

We are in a collaborative arrangement with Quintiles
    Transnational Corp. (Quintiles) to market and promote Cymbalta
    in the U.S. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement,
    Quintiles shares in the costs to co-promote Cymbalta with us. In
    exchange, Quintiles receives a payment based upon net sales.
    According to the current agreement, Quintiles’ obligation
    to promote Cymbalta expires in 2009, and we will pay a lower
    rate on net sales for three years post their promotion efforts.
    The royalties paid to Quintiles are recorded in marketing,
    selling, and administrative expenses.

-63-

Prasugrel

We are in a collaborative arrangement with Daiichi Sankyo
    Company, Limited (D-S) to develop, market, and promote
    prasugrel, an antiplatelet agent for the treatment of patients
    with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who are being managed with
    an artery-opening procedure known as percutaneous coronary
    intervention (PCI). Prasugrel was approved for marketing by the
    European Commission under the tradename Efient in February 2009.
    We have submitted a new drug application to the FDA and are
    currently awaiting its decision. Within this arrangement, we
    have agreed to co-promote under the same trademark in certain
    territories (including the U.S. and five major European
    markets), while we have exclusive marketing rights in certain
    other territories. D-S has exclusive marketing rights in Japan.
    Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we paid D-S an upfront
    license fee and agreed to pay future success milestones. Both
    parties share in the costs of the development and marketing in
    the co-promotion territories and share in the profits according
    to the terms specified in the agreement. D-S is responsible for
    supplying bulk product, but we will produce the finished product
    for our exclusive and co-promotion territories. Profits in the
    U.S. and other co-promotion territories will be shared
    according to the agreement. In our exclusive territories, we
    will pay D-S a royalty specific to those territories. Profit
    share payments made to D-S will be recorded as marketing,
    selling, and administrative expenses. All royalties paid to D-S
    will be recorded in cost of sales.

TPG-Axon
    Capital

In 2008, we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of
    TPG-Axon Capital (TPG) for the Phase III development of our
    gamma-secretase inhibitor and our A-beta antibody, our two lead
    molecules for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s
    disease. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, both we and TPG
    will provide funding for the Alzheimer’s clinical trials.
    Funding from TPG will not exceed $325 million and could
    extend into 2014. In exchange for their funding, TPG may receive
    success-based milestones totaling $330 million and mid- to
    high-single digit royalties that are contingent upon the
    successful development of the Alzheimer’s treatments. The
    royalties will be paid for approximately eight years after
    launch of a product. Reimbursements received from TPG for their
    portion of research and development costs incurred related to
    the Alzheimer’s treatments are recorded as a reduction to
    the research and development expense line item on the
    consolidated statement of operations. The reimbursement from TPG
    is not expected to be material in any period.

Note 5:

Asset
    Impairments, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges

The components of the charges included in asset impairments,
    restructuring, and other special charges in our consolidated
    statements of income are described below.

Asset
    Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other
    Charges

We incurred asset impairment, restructuring, and other special
    charges of $80.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
    These charges were the result of decisions approved by
    management in the fourth quarter as well as previously announced
    strategic decisions. The primary components of this charge
    include non-cash asset impairments of $35.1 million for the
    write down of impaired assets, all of which have no future use,
    and other charges of $44.9 million, primarily related to
    severance and environmental cleanup charges in connection with
    previously announced strategic decisions made in prior periods.
    We anticipate that substantially all of these costs will be paid
    during the first quarter of 2009.

As discussed further in Note 14, in the third quarter of
    2008, we recorded a charge of $1.48 billion related to the
    Zyprexa investigations led by the U.S. Attorney for the
    Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as well as the resolution of a
    multi-state investigation regarding Zyprexa involving
    32 states and the District of Columbia.

Further, in the third quarter of 2008, as a result of our
    previously announced agreements with Covance Inc. (Covance),
    Quintiles Transnational Corp. (Quintiles), and Ingenix
    Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., doing business as i3 Statprobe
    (i3), and as part of our efforts to transform into a more
    flexible organization, we recognized asset impairments,
    restructuring, and other special charges of $182.4 million.
    We sold our Greenfield, Indiana site to Covance, a global drug
    development services firm, and entered into a

10-year

service agreement under which Covance will provide preclinical
    toxicology work and perform additional

-64-

clinical trials for us as well as operate the site to meet our
    needs and those of other pharmaceutical industry clients. In
    addition, we signed agreements with Quintiles for clinical trial
    monitoring services and with i3 for clinical data management
    services. Components of the third-quarter restructuring charge
    include non-cash charges of $148.3 million primarily
    related to the loss on sale of assets sold to Covance, severance
    costs of $27.8 million, and exit costs of
    $6.3 million. Substantially all of these costs were paid in
    2008.

In the second quarter of 2008, we recognized restructuring and
    other special charges of $88.9 million. In addition, we
    recognized non-cash charges of $57.1 million for the write
    down of impaired manufacturing assets that had no future use,
    which were included in cost of sales. In April 2008, we
    announced a voluntary exit program that was offered to employees
    primarily in manufacturing. Components of the second-quarter
    restructuring charge include total severance costs of
    $53.5 million related to these programs and
    $35.4 million related to exit costs incurred during the
    second quarter in connection with previously announced strategic
    decisions made in prior periods. Substantially all of these
    costs were paid by the end of July 2008.

In March 2008, we terminated development of our AIR Insulin
    program, which was being conducted in collaboration with
    Alkermes, Inc. The program had been in Phase III clinical
    development as a potential treatment for type 1 and type 2
    diabetes. This decision was not a result of any observations
    during AIR Insulin trials relating to the safety of the product,
    but rather was a result of increasing uncertainties in the
    regulatory environment, and a thorough evaluation of the
    evolving commercial and clinical potential of the product
    compared to existing medical therapies. As a result of this
    decision, we halted our ongoing clinical studies and
    transitioned the AIR Insulin patients in these studies to other
    appropriate therapies. We implemented a patient program in the
    U.S., and other regions of the world where allowed, to provide
    clinical trial participants with appropriate financial support
    to fund their medications and diagnostic supplies through the
    end of 2008.

We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special
    charges of $145.7 million in the first quarter of 2008.
    These charges were primarily related to the decision to
    terminate development of AIR Insulin. Components of these
    charges included non-cash charges of $40.9 million for the
    write down of impaired manufacturing assets that had no use
    beyond the AIR Insulin program, as well as charges of
    $91.7 million for estimated contractual obligations and
    wind-down costs associated with the termination of clinical
    trials and certain development activities, and costs associated
    with the patient program to transition participants from AIR
    Insulin. This amount includes an estimate of Alkermes’
    wind-down costs for which we were contractually obligated. The
    wind-down activities and patient programs were substantially
    complete by the end of 2008. The remaining component of these
    charges, $13.1 million, is related to exit costs incurred
    in the first quarter of 2008 in connection with previously
    announced strategic decisions made in prior periods.

We incurred asset impairment, restructuring, and other special
    charges of $67.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
    These charges were a result of decisions approved by management
    in the fourth quarter as well as previously announced strategic
    decisions. Components of this charge include non-cash charges of
    $42.5 million for the write down of impaired assets, all of
    which have no future use, and other charges of
    $25.1 million, primarily related to additional severance
    and environmental cleanup charges related to previously
    announced strategic decisions. The impairment charges were
    necessary to adjust the carrying value of the assets to fair
    value. These restructuring activities were substantially
    complete at December 31, 2007.

In connection with previously announced strategic decisions, we
    recorded asset impairment, restructuring, and other special
    charges of $123.0 million in the first quarter of 2007.
    These charges primarily related to a voluntary severance program
    at one of our U.S. plants and other costs related to this
    action as well as management actions taken in the fourth quarter
    of 2006 as described below. The component of these charges
    related to the non-cash asset impairment was $67.6 million,
    and were necessary to adjust the carrying value of the assets to
    fair value. These restructuring activities were substantially
    complete at December 31, 2007.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, management approved plans to
    close two research and development facilities and one production
    facility outside the U.S. Management also made the decision
    to stop construction of a planned insulin manufacturing plant in
    the U.S. in an effort to increase productivity in research
    and development operations and to reduce excess manufacturing
    capacity. These decisions, as well as other strategic changes,
    resulted in non-cash charges of $308.8 million for the
    write down of certain impaired assets, substantially all of
    which have no future use, and other charges of
    $141.5 million, primarily related to

-65-

severance and contract termination payments. The impairment
    charges were necessary to adjust the carrying value of the
    assets to fair value. These restructuring activities were
    substantially complete at December 31, 2007.

Product
    Liability and Other Special Charges

As a result of our product liability exposures, the substantial
    majority of which were related to Zyprexa, we recorded net
    pretax charges of $111.9 million and $494.9 million in
    2007 and 2006, respectively. These charges, which are net of
    anticipated insurance recoveries, include the costs of product
    liability settlements and related defense costs, reserves for
    product liability exposures and defense costs regarding known
    product liability claims, and expected future claims to the
    extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable
    number and cost of the claims. See Note 14 for further
    discussion.

Note 6:

Financial
    Instruments and Investments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk
    consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing
    investments. Wholesale distributors of life-sciences products
    and managed care organizations account for a substantial portion
    of trade receivables; collateral is generally not required. The
    risk associated with this concentration is mitigated by our
    ongoing credit review procedures and insurance. We place
    substantially all of our interest-bearing investments with major
    financial institutions, in U.S. government securities, or
    with top-rated corporate issuers. At December 31, 2008, our
    investments in debt securities were comprised of 41 percent
    corporate securities, 34 percent asset-backed securities,
    and 25 percent U.S. government securities. In
    accordance with documented corporate policies, we limit the
    amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or
    corporate issuer. We are exposed to credit-related losses in the
    event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial
    instruments but do not expect any counterparties to fail to meet
    their obligations given their high credit ratings.

We determine fair values based on a market approach using quoted
    market values, significant other observable inputs for identical
    or comparable assets or liabilities, or discounted cash flow
    analyses, principally for long-term debt. The fair value of
    equity method and other investments is not readily available.
    Approximately $1.1 billion of our investments in debt
    securities mature within five years.

A summary of the fair value of available-for-sale securities in
    an unrealized gain or loss position and the amount of unrealized
    gains and losses (pretax) in other comprehensive income at
    December 31 follows:

Fair value of securities in an unrealized loss position

1,046.1

964.6

The securities in an unrealized loss position are comprised of
    fixed-rate debt securities of varying maturities. The value of
    fixed income securities is sensitive to changes to the yield
    curve and other market conditions which led to the decline in
    value during 2008. Approximately 90 percent of the
    securities in a loss position are investment-grade debt
    securities. The majority of these securities first moved into an
    unrealized loss position during 2008. At this time, there is no
    indication of default on interest or principal payments for
    asset-backed securities. We have the intent and ability to hold
    the securities in a loss position until the market values
    recover or all of the underlying cash flows have been received
    and we have concluded that no other-than-temporary loss exists
    at December 31, 2008. The fair values of all of our auction
    rate securities and collateralized debt obligations held at
    December 31, 2008 were determined using Level 3
    inputs. We do not hold securities issued by structured
    investment vehicles at December 31, 2008.

The net adjustment to unrealized gains and losses (net of tax)
    on available-for-sale securities increased (decreased) other
    comprehensive income by $(125.8) million,
    $(5.4) million, and $0.3 million in 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively. Activity related to our available-for-sale
    investment portfolio was as follows:

During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    net losses related to ineffectiveness and net losses related to
    the portion of our risk-management hedging instruments, fair
    value and cash flow hedges, excluded from the assessment of
    effectiveness were not material.

We expect to reclassify an estimated $10.2 million of
    pretax net losses on cash flow hedges of the variability in
    expected future interest payments on floating rate debt from
    accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings during 2009.

Available-for-sale investment securities are classified as
    long-term investments when they are likely to be held for more
    than one year because of our intent to hold securities in an
    unrealized loss position until the market values recover or all
    of the underlying cash flows have been received.

In March 2007, we issued $2.50 billion of fixed-rate notes
    ($1.00 billion at 5.20 percent due in 2017;
    $700.0 million at 5.50 percent due in 2027; and
    $800.0 million at 5.55 percent due in 2037).

The $400.0 million of floating rate bonds outstanding at
    December 31, 2008 are due in 2037 and have variable
    interest rates at LIBOR plus our six-month credit spread,
    adjusted semiannually (total of 4.10 percent at
    December 31, 2008). We pay interest monthly on this
    borrowing program. We expect to refinance the bonds in 2009 and
    have classified them as current at December 31, 2008.

The 6.55 percent Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)
    debentures are obligations of the ESOP but are shown on the
    consolidated balance sheet because we guarantee them. The
    principal and interest on the debt are funded by contributions
    from us and by dividends received on certain shares held by the
    ESOP. Because of the amortizing feature of the ESOP debt,
    bondholders will receive both interest and principal payments
    each quarter. The balance was $81.9 million and
    $90.6 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, and is included in Other in the table above.

The aggregate amounts of maturities on long-term debt for the
    next five years are as follows: 2009, $420.4 million; 2010,
    $19.7 million; 2011, $13.1 million; 2012,
    $510.8 million; and 2013, $11.1 million.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, short-term borrowings
    included $5.43 billion and $18.6 million,
    respectively, of notes payable to banks and commercial paper.
    Commercial paper was issued in late 2008 for the acquisition of
    ImClone. At December 31, 2008, we have $1.24 billion
    of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion
    of which backs our commercial paper program. Additionally, in
    November 2008, we obtained a one-year short-term revolving
    credit facility in the amount of $4.00 billion as

back-up,

alternative financing. Compensating balances and commitment fees
    are not material, and there are no conditions that are probable
    of occurring under which the lines may be withdrawn.

We have converted approximately 50 percent of all
    fixed-rate debt to floating rates through the use of interest
    rate swaps. The weighted-average effective borrowing rates based
    on debt obligations and interest rates at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, including the effects of interest rate swaps for
    hedged debt obligations, were 4.77 percent and
    5.47 percent, respectively.

In 2008, 2007, and 2006, cash payments of interest on borrowings
    totaled $203.1 million, $159.2 million, and
    $305.7 million, respectively, net of capitalized interest.

In accordance with the requirements of SFAS 133, the
    portion of our fixed-rate debt obligations that is hedged is
    reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as an amount equal
    to the sum of the debt’s carrying value plus the fair value
    adjustment representing changes in fair value of the hedged debt
    attributable to movements in market interest rates subsequent to
    the inception of the hedge.

Note 8:

Stock
    Plans

Stock-based compensation expense in the amount of
    $255.3 million, $282.0 million, and
    $359.3 million was recognized in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively, as well as related tax benefits of
    $88.6 million, $96.4 million, and $115.9 million,
    respectively. Our stock-based compensation expense consists
    primarily of performance awards (PAs), shareholder value awards
    (SVAs), and stock options. We recognize the stock-based
    compensation expense over the requisite service period of the
    individual grantees, which generally equals the vesting period.
    We provide newly issued shares and treasury stock to satisfy
    stock option exercises and for the issuance of PA and SVA
    shares. We classify tax benefits resulting from tax deductions
    in excess of the compensation cost recognized for exercised
    stock options as a financing cash flow in the consolidated
    statements of cash flows.

At December 31, 2008, additional stock options, PAs, SVAs,
    or restricted stock grants may be granted under the 2002 Lilly
    Stock Plan for not more than 88.0 million shares.

Performance
    Award Program

Performance awards (PAs) are granted to officers and management
    and are payable in shares of our common stock. The number of PA
    shares actually issued, if any, varies depending on the
    achievement of certain pre-established

earnings-per-share

targets over a one-year period. PA shares are accounted for at
    fair value based upon the closing stock price on the date of
    grant and fully vest at the end of the fiscal year of the grant.
    The fair values of performance awards granted in 2008, 2007, and
    2006 were $51.22, $54.23, and $56.18, respectively. The number
    of shares ultimately issued for the performance award program is
    dependent upon the earnings achieved during the vesting period.
    Pursuant to this plan, approximately 2.5 million shares,
    2.3 million shares, and 1.7 million shares were issued
    in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Approximately
    2.8 million shares are expected to be issued in 2009.

Shareholder
    Value Award Program

In 2007, we implemented a shareholder value award (SVA) program,
    which replaced our stock option program. SVAs are granted to
    officers and management and are payable in shares of common
    stock at the end of a three-year period. The number of shares
    actually issued varies depending on our stock price at the end
    of the three-year vesting period compared to pre-established
    target stock prices. We measure the fair value of the SVA unit
    on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The
    Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables
    that determine the probability of satisfying the market
    condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair
    value of the award. Expected volatilities utilized in the model
    are based on implied volatilities from traded options on our
    stock, historical volatility of our stock price, and other
    factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical
    experience and our estimate of future dividend yields. The
    risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury
    yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The weighted-average
    fair values of the SVA units granted during 2008 and 2007 were
    $43.46 and $49.85, respectively, determined using the following
    assumptions:



Expected dividend yield

The maximum number of shares that could ultimately be issued
    upon vesting of the SVA units outstanding at December 31,
    2008, is 2.7 million. As of December 31, 2008, the
    total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to
    nonvested SVAs amounted to $46.7 million, which will be
    amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service
    period of 21.6 months.

Stock
    Option Program

Stock options were granted in 2006 to officers and management at
    exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our stock
    price at the date of grant. No stock options were granted in
    2008 or 2007. Options fully vest three years from the grant date
    and have a term of 10 years. We utilized a lattice-based
    option valuation model for estimating the fair value of the
    stock options. The lattice model allows the use of a range of
    assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate, and
    employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in
    the lattice model are based on implied volatilities from traded
    options on our stock, historical volatility of our stock price,
    and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on
    historical experience and our estimate of future dividend
    yields. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
    The model incorporates exercise and post-vesting forfeiture
    assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The
    expected life of the 2006 grants is derived from the output of
    the lattice model. The weighted-average fair values of the
    individual options granted during 2006 were $15.61, determined
    using the following assumptions:

    value of options vested during 2008, 2007, and 2006 amounted to
    $84.1 million, $381.8 million, and
    $249.1 million, respectively. We received cash of
    $2.9 million, $15.2 million, and $66.2 million
    from exercises of stock options during 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively, and recognized related tax benefits of
    $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $11.3 million
    during those same years.

As of December 31, 2008, there was no significant remaining
    unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock
    options.

Note 9:

Other
    Assets and Other Liabilities

Our other receivables include receivables from our collaboration
    partners and a variety of other items. The decrease in other
    receivables is primarily attributable to a decrease in income
    tax receivable, and lower insurance recoverables.

Our sundry assets primarily include our deferred tax assets
    (Note 12), capitalized computer software, and the fair
    value of our interest rate swaps. The increase in sundry assets
    is primarily attributable to an increase in deferred tax assets
    and an increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps.

Our other current liabilities include product litigation, tax
    liabilities, and a variety of other items. The increase in other
    current liabilities is caused primarily by an increase in
    product litigation liabilities, specifically, the
    $1.42 billion related to the EDPA settlements discussed in
    Note 14, and an increase in current deferred taxes.

Our other noncurrent liabilities include deferred income from
    our collaboration and out-licensing arrangements, the long-term
    portion of our estimated product return liabilities, product
    litigation, and a variety of other items. The increase in other
    noncurrent liabilities is primarily due to an increase in
    deferred income attributable to our 2008 acquisitions and other
    business development arrangements.

As of December 31, 2008, we have purchased
    $2.58 billion of our announced $3.0 billion share
    repurchase program. We acquired approximately 2.1 million
    shares in 2006 under this program. No shares were repurchased in
    2008 or 2007.

We have 5 million authorized shares of preferred stock. As
    of December 31, 2008 and 2007, no preferred stock has been
    issued.

We have funded an employee benefit trust with 40 million
    shares of Lilly common stock to provide a source of funds to
    assist us in meeting our obligations under various employee
    benefit plans. The funding had no net impact on
    shareholders’ equity as we consolidate the employee benefit
    trust. The cost basis of the shares held in the trust was
    $2.64 billion and is shown as a reduction in
    shareholders’ equity, which offsets the resulting

-72-

increases of $2.61 billion in additional paid-in capital
    and $25.0 million in common stock. Any dividend
    transactions between us and the trust are eliminated. Stock held
    by the trust is not considered outstanding in the computation of
    earnings per share. The assets of the trust were not used to
    fund any of our obligations under these employee benefit plans
    in 2008, 2007, or 2006. In the first quarter of 2009, we
    contributed an additional 10.0 million shares to the trust.

We have an ESOP as a funding vehicle for the existing employee
    savings plan. The ESOP used the proceeds of a loan from us to
    purchase shares of common stock from the treasury. The ESOP
    issued $200.0 million of third-party debt, repayment of
    which was guaranteed by us (see Note 7). The proceeds were
    used to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market.
    Shares of common stock held by the ESOP will be allocated to
    participating employees annually through 2017 as part of our
    savings plan contribution. The fair value of shares allocated
    each period is recognized as compensation expense.

At December 31, 2008, we had net operating losses and other
    carryforwards for international and U.S. income tax
    purposes of $1.24 billion: $84.3 million will expire
    within 10 years; $1.09 billion will expire between 10
    and 20 years; and $63.1 million of the carryforwards
    will never expire. The primary component of the remaining
    portion of the deferred tax asset for tax loss carryforwards and
    carrybacks is related to net operating losses for state income
    tax purposes that are fully reserved. We also have tax credit
    carryforwards and carrybacks of $755.0 million available to
    reduce future income taxes; $295.1 million will be carried
    back; $84.1 million of the tax credit carryforwards will
    expire after 5 years; and $13.0 million of the tax
    credit carryforwards will never expire. The remaining portion of
    the tax credit carryforwards is related to federal tax credits
    of $97.4 million and state tax credits of
    $265.4 million, both of which are fully reserved.

Domestic and Puerto Rican companies generated the entire
    consolidated loss before income taxes in 2008 and contributed
    approximately 7 percent and 18 percent in 2007 and
    2006, respectively, to consolidated income before income taxes.
    We have a subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico under a tax
    incentive grant. The current tax incentive grant will not expire
    prior to 2017.

At December 31, 2008, we had an aggregate of
    $13.31 billion of unremitted earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries that have been or are intended to be permanently
    reinvested for continued use in foreign operations and that, if
    distributed, would result in additional income tax expense at
    approximately the U.S. statutory rate.

Cash payments (refunds) of income taxes totaled
    $(52.0) million, $1.01 billion, and
    $864.0 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. FIN 48
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
    the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As a
    result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized an
    increase of $8.6 million in the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits, and an offsetting reduction to the January 1,
    2007 balance of retained earnings. A reconciliation of the
    beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if
    recognized, would affect our effective tax rate was
    $863.8 million at December 31, 2008.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction
    and various state, local, and

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

We are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local,
    or

non-U.S. income

tax examinations in major taxing jurisdictions for years before
    2002. During the first quarter of 2008, we completed and
    effectively settled our Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit of
    tax years

2001-2004

except for one matter for which we will seek resolution through
    the IRS administrative appeals process. As a result of the IRS
    audit conclusion, gross unrecognized tax benefits were reduced
    by approximately $618 million, and the consolidated results
    of operations were benefited by $210.3 million through a
    reduction in income tax expense. The majority of the reduction
    in gross unrecognized tax benefits related to intercompany
    pricing positions that were agreed with the IRS in a prior audit
    cycle for which a prepayment of tax was made in 2005.
    Application of the prepayment and utilization of tax carryovers
    resulted in a refund of approximately $50 million. The IRS
    began its examination of tax years

2005-2007

during the third quarter of 2008. We do not believe it is
    reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next
    twelve months.

We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, we
    recognized income tax expense (benefit) of
    $(118.0) million, $66.6 million, and
    $51.2 million, respectively, related to interest and
    penalties. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our accruals for
    the payment of interest and penalties totaled
    $177.6 million

-75-

and $364.2 million, respectively. Substantially all of the
    expense (benefit) and accruals relate to interest. The change in
    the 2008 accrual reflects the impact of the effective settlement
    of the IRS audit discussed above.

The unrecognized net actuarial loss and unrecognized prior
    service cost (benefit) have not yet been recognized in net
    periodic pension costs and are included in accumulated other
    comprehensive loss at December 31, 2008.

In 2009, we expect to recognize from accumulated other
    comprehensive loss as components of net periodic benefit cost,
    $97.5 million of unrecognized net actuarial loss and
    $8.7 million of unrecognized prior service cost related to
    our defined benefit pension plans, and $69.4 million of
    unrecognized net actuarial loss and

-76-

$35.9 million of unrecognized prior service benefit related
    to our retiree health benefit plans. We do not expect any plan
    assets to be returned to us in 2009.

In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we have
    considered our historical assumptions compared with actual
    results, an analysis of current market conditions, asset
    allocations, and the views of leading financial advisers and
    economists. Our plan assets in our U.S. defined benefit
    pension and retiree health plans comprise approximately
    84 percent of our worldwide benefit plan assets. Including
    the investment losses due to overall market conditions in 2001,
    2002, and 2008, our

20-year

annualized rate of return on our U.S. defined benefit
    pension plans and retiree health benefit plan was approximately
    8.2 percent as of December 31, 2008. Health-care-cost
    trend rates are assumed to increase at an annual rate of
    8.5 percent in 2009, decreasing by approximately
    0.6 percent per year to an ultimate rate of
    5.5 percent by 2014.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future
    service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

The total accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit

    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The projected
    benefit obligation and fair value of the plan assets for the
    defined benefit pension plans with projected benefit obligations
    in excess of plan assets were $6.35 billion and
    $4.80 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2008,

If the health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one
    percentage point each future year, the December 31, 2008,
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would increase by
    $247.8 million (13.9 percent) and the aggregate of the
    service cost and interest cost components of the 2008 annual
    expense would increase by $26.9 million
    (16.0 percent). A one-percentage-point decrease in these
    rates would decrease the December 31, 2008, accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligation by $192.0 million
    (10.8 percent) and the aggregate of the 2008 service cost
    and interest cost by $20.7 million (12.3 percent).

We have defined contribution savings plans that cover our
    eligible employees worldwide. The purpose of these defined
    contribution plans is generally to provide additional financial
    security during retirement by providing employees with an
    incentive to save. Our contributions to the plan are based on
    employee contributions and the level of our match. Expenses
    under the plans totaled $114.1 million,
    $112.3 million, and $106.5 million, for the years
    2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

We provide certain other postemployment benefits primarily
    related to disability benefits and accrue for the related cost
    over the service lives of employees. Expenses associated with
    these benefit plans in 2008, 2007, and 2006 were not significant.

Our U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit
    plan investment allocation strategy currently comprises
    approximately 88 percent to 92 percent growth
    investments and 8 percent to 12 percent fixed-income
    investments. Within the growth investment allocation, the plan
    asset strategy encompasses equity and equity-like instruments
    that are expected to represent approximately 75 percent of
    our plan asset portfolio of both public and private market
    investments. The largest component of these equity and
    equity-like instruments is public equity securities that are
    well diversified and invested in U.S. and international
    small-to-large companies. The remaining portion of the growth
    investment allocation includes alternative investments.

In 2009, we expect to contribute approximately $55 million
    to our defined benefit pension plans to satisfy minimum funding
    requirements for the year. In addition, we expect to contribute
    approximately $15 million of additional discretionary
    funding in 2009 to our defined benefit plans. We do not expect
    to make any contributions to our post-retirement health benefit
    plans during 2009.

Note 14:

Contingencies

We are a party to various legal actions, government
    investigations, and environmental proceedings. The most
    significant of these are described below. While it is not
    possible to determine the outcome of these matters, we believe
    that, except as specifically noted below, the resolution of all
    such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly
    be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one
    accounting period.

    brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch-Waxman Act
    (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of
    1984):

•

Cymbalta:

Sixteen generic drug manufacturers have
    submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) seeking
    permission to market generic versions of Cymbalta prior to the
    expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (the earliest of
    which expires in 2013). Of these challengers, all allege
    non-infringement of the patent claims directed to the commercial
    formulation, and eight allege invalidity of the patent claims
    directed to the active ingredient duloxetine. Of the eight
    challengers to the compound patent claims, one further alleges
    invalidity of the claims directed to the use of Cymbalta for
    treating fibromyalgia, and one alleges the patent having claims
    directed to the active ingredient is unenforceable. Lawsuits
    have been filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of Indiana against Activis Elizabeth LLC; Aurobindo
    Pharma Ltd.; Cobalt Laboratories, Inc.; Impax Laboratories,
    Inc.; Lupin Limited; Sandoz Inc.; Sun Pharma Global, Inc.; and
    Wockhardt Limited, seeking rulings that the patents are valid,
    infringed, and enforceable. Answers to the complaints are
    pending.

•

Gemzar:

Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sicor), Mayne Pharma
    (USA) Inc. (Mayne), and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun)
    each submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic
    versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant
    U.S. patents (compound patent expiring in 2010 and
    method-of-use patent expiring in 2013), and alleging that these
    patents are invalid. We filed lawsuits in the U.S. District
    Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Sicor
    (February 2006) and Mayne (October 2006 and January 2008),
    seeking rulings that these patents are valid and are being
    infringed. The suit against Sicor has been scheduled for trial
    in July 2009.  Sicor’s ANDAs have been approved by the FDA;
    however, Sicor must provide 90 days notice prior to
    marketing generic Gemzar to allow time for us to seek a
    preliminary injunction. Both suits against Mayne have been
    administratively closed, and the parties have agreed to be bound
    by the results of the Sicor suit. In November 2007, Sun filed a
    declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court
    for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking rulings that our
    method-of-use and

-79-

compound patents are invalid or unenforceable, or would not be
    infringed by the sale of Sun’s generic product. This trial
    is scheduled for December 2009.

•

Alimta:

Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc. (Teva) and APP
    Pharmaceuticals, LLC (APP) each submitted ANDAs seeking approval
    to market generic versions of Alimta prior to the expiration of
    the relevant U.S. patent (licensed from the Trustees of
    Princeton University and expiring in 2016), and alleging the
    patent is invalid. We, along with Princeton, filed lawsuits in
    the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
    against Teva and APP, seeking rulings that the compound patent
    is valid and infringed. Trial is scheduled for November 8,
    2010.

•

Evista:

Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr) submitted an ANDA
    in 2002 seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista
    prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents
    (expiring in

2012-2017)

and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or
    not infringed. In November 2002, we filed a lawsuit against Barr
    in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
    Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid,
    enforceable, and being infringed by Barr. Teva Pharmaceuticals
    USA, Inc. (Teva) has also submitted an ANDA seeking permission
    to market a generic version of Evista. In June 2006, we filed a
    similar lawsuit against Teva in the U.S. District Court for
    the Southern District of Indiana. The lawsuit against Teva is
    currently scheduled for trial beginning March 9, 2009,
    while no trial date has been set in the lawsuit against Barr. In
    April 2008, the FDA granted Teva tentative approval of its ANDA,
    but Teva’s ability to market a generic product is subject
    to a statutory stay, which has been extended to expire on
    March 9, 2009. If the stay expires and the company cannot
    obtain preliminary relief from the court, Teva can launch its
    generic product, regardless of the status of the current
    litigation, but subject to our right to recover damages, should
    we prevail at trial.

We believe each of these Hatch-Waxman challenges is without
    merit and expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is
    not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and
    accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail.
    An unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a
    material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity, and financial position.

We have received challenges to Zyprexa patents in a number of
    countries outside the U.S.:

•

In Canada, several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have
    challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and
    method-of-use patent (expiring in 2011). In April 2007, the
    Canadian Federal Court ruled against the first challenger,
    Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and that ruling was affirmed on appeal in
    February 2008. In June 2007, the Canadian Federal Court held
    that an invalidity allegation of a second challenger, Novopharm
    Ltd. (Novopharm), was justified and denied our request that
    Novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing approval for
    generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm began selling generic
    olanzapine in Canada in the third quarter of 2007. We sued
    Novopharm for patent infringement, and the trial began in
    November 2008. We expect the trial to run through the first
    quarter of 2009, with a decision in the second half of 2009. In
    November 2007, Apotex filed an action seeking a declaration of
    the invalidity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use
    patents, and no trial date has been set. We have brought similar
    actions against Pharmascience (August 2007), Sandoz (July 2007),
    Nu-Pharm (June 2008), Genpharm (June 2008) and Cobalt
    (January 2009); none of these suits has been scheduled for
    trial. Pharmascience has agreed to be bound by the outcome of
    the Novopharm suit, and, pending the outcome of the lawsuit, we
    have agreed not to take any further steps to prevent the company
    from coming to market with generic olanzapine tablets, subject
    to a contingent damages obligation should we be successful
    against Novopharm.

•

In Germany, generic pharmaceutical manufacturers
    Egis-Gyogyszergyar and Neolab Ltd. challenged the validity of
    our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent (expiring in
    2011). In June 2007, the German Federal Patent Court held that
    our patent is invalid. Generic olanzapine was launched by
    competitors in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2007. We
    appealed the decision to the German Federal Supreme Court and
    following a hearing in December 2008, the Supreme Court reversed
    the Federal Patent Court and found the patent to be valid.
    Following the decision of the Supreme Court, the generic
    companies either agreed to withdraw from the market or were
    subject to preliminary injunction. We are pursuing these
    companies for damages arising from infringement.

-80-

•

We have received challenges in a number of other countries,
    including Spain, the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, and several
    smaller European countries. In Spain, we have been successful at
    both the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the
    generic manufacturers’ challenges, but further legal
    challenge is now pending before the Commercial Court in Madrid.
    In the U.K., the generic pharmaceutical manufacturer
    Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (UK) Limited has challenged
    the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent
    (expiring in 2011). In October 2008, the Patents Court in the
    High Court, London ruled that our patent was valid.
    Dr. Reddy’s appealed this decision, and a hearing date
    for the appeal has not been set.

We are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our
    Zyprexa patents on a

country-by-country

basis. We cannot determine the outcome of this litigation. The
    availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could
    have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
    operations.

Xigris and Evista:

In June 2002, Ariad Pharmaceuticals,
    Inc., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Whitehead
    Institute for Biomedical Research, and the President and Fellows
    of Harvard College in the U.S. District Court for the
    District of Massachusetts sued us, alleging that sales of two of
    our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement
    of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling
    phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on past and
    future sales of these products. On May 4, 2006, a jury in
    Boston issued an initial decision in the case that Xigris and
    Evista sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the
    plaintiffs approximately $65 million in damages, calculated
    by applying a 2.3 percent royalty to all U.S. sales of
    Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent
    through the date of trial. In addition, a separate bench trial
    with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts was held in
    August 2006, on our contention that the patent is unenforceable
    and impermissibly covers natural processes. In June 2005, the
    United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) commenced a
    reexamination of the patent, and in August 2007 took the
    position that the Ariad claims at issue are unpatentable, a
    position that Ariad continues to contest. In September 2007, the
    Court entered a final judgment indicating that Ariad’s
    claims are patentable, valid, and enforceable, and finding
    damages in the amount of $65 million plus a
    2.3 percent royalty on net U.S. sales of Xigris
    and Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the
    Court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after
    all rights to appeal have been exhausted. We have appealed this
    judgment. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard
    oral arguments on the appeal on February 6, 2009. We
    believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we
    will ultimately prevail on these issues, and therefore that the
    likelihood of any monetary damages is remote.

Government
    Investigations and Related Litigation

In March 2004, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the
    Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA) advised us that it had
    commenced an investigation related to our U.S. marketing
    and promotional practices, including our communications with
    physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and
    advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weekly. In
    addition, the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units of more than
    30 states coordinated with the EDPA in its investigation of
    any Medicaid-related claims relating to our marketing and
    promotion of Zyprexa. In January 2009, we announced that we
    reached resolution of this matter. As part of the resolution, we
    pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug, and
    Cosmetic Act and agreed to pay $615.0 million. The
    misdemeanor plea is for the off-label promotion of Zyprexa in
    elderly populations as treatment for dementia, including
    Alzheimer’s dementia, between September 1999 and March
    2001. We have also entered into a settlement agreement resolving
    the federal civil claims, under which we will pay approximately
    $438.0 million, although we do not admit to the
    allegations. We have also agreed to settle the civil
    investigations brought by the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units
    of the states that have coordinated with the EDPA in its
    investigation, and will make available a maximum of
    approximately $362.0 million for payment to those states
    that agree to settle. The charge we recorded for this matter in
    the third quarter of $1.42 billion will be sufficient to
    cover these payments. Also, as part of the settlement, we have
    entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of
    Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health
    and Human Services (HHS). This agreement will require us to
    maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set of
    defined corporate integrity obligations for five years. The
    agreement also provides for an independent third-party review
    organization to assess and report on the company’s systems,
    processes, policies, procedures and practices.

-81-

In June 2005, we received a subpoena from the Office of the
    Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, of the State of
    Florida, seeking production of documents relating to sales of
    Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect
    to Zyprexa. In September 2006, we received a subpoena from the
    California Attorney General’s Office seeking production of
    documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain
    Zyprexa’s status on California’s formulary, marketing
    and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa, and
    remuneration of health care providers. We expect these matters
    to be resolved if Florida and California participate in the
    state component of the EDPA resolution.

Beginning in August 2006, we received civil investigative
    demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of
    states under various state consumer protection laws. Most of
    these requests became part of a multi-state investigative effort
    coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general. In
    October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and
    the District of Columbia. While there is no finding that we have
    violated any provision of the state laws under which the
    investigations were conducted, we paid $62.0 million and
    agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding Zyprexa for a
    period of six years, through consent decrees filed in the
    settling states. The 32 states participating in the
    settlement are: Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida,
    Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland,
    Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey,
    New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
    Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
    Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Product
    Liability and Related Litigation

We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa
    product liability lawsuits in the U.S. and have been
    notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed
    suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the
    “claims”) allege a variety of injuries from the use of
    Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or
    contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims
    seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically
    accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side
    effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we
    improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits
    are part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding
    before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District
    Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596).

Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various
    claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product
    liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the
    claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 32,670
    claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits
    and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as
    follows:

•

In June 2005, we reached an agreement in principle (and in
    September 2005 a final agreement) to settle more than 8,000
    claims for $690.0 million plus $10.0 million to cover
    administration of the settlement.

•

In January 2007, we reached agreements with a number of
    plaintiffs’ attorneys to settle more than 18,000 claims for
    approximately $500 million.

The 2005 settlement totaling $700.0 million was paid during
    2005. The January 2007 settlements were paid during 2007.

We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in
    all remaining claims. The U.S. Zyprexa product liability
    claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 105
    lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 120 plaintiffs,
    of which about 80 cases covering about 90 plaintiffs are part of
    the MDL. No trials have been scheduled related to these claims.

In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits seeking class
    action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa.
    One of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of
    Quebec, and a second has been certified in Ontario and includes
    all Canadian residents except for residents of Quebec and
    British Columbia. The allegations in the Canadian actions are
    similar to those in the litigation pending in the U.S.

-82-

Since the beginning of 2005, we have recorded aggregate net
    pretax charges of $1.61 billion for Zyprexa product
    liability matters. The net charges, which take into account our
    actual insurance recoveries, covered the following:

•

The cost of the Zyprexa product liability settlements to
    date; and

•

Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs
    regarding the known Zyprexa product liability claims and
    expected future claims to the extent we could formulate a
    reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the
    claims.

In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in
    state court in Louisiana on behalf of the Louisiana Department
    of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or
    contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that
    we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have been removed
    to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the
    Eastern District of New York (EDNY). In these actions, the
    Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the costs it
    paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit
    programs, as well as the costs the department alleges it has
    incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. We
    have been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of
    Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Minnesota, Mississippi,
    Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and
    West Virginia in the courts of the respective states. The
    Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New
    Mexico, and West Virginia cases are part of the MDL proceedings
    in the EDNY. The Alaska case was settled in March 2008 for a
    payment of $15.0 million, plus terms designed to ensure,
    subject to certain limitations and conditions, that Alaska is
    treated as favorably as certain other states that may settle
    with us in the future over similar claims. The following cases
    have been set for trial in 2009: Connecticut in the EDNY in
    June, Pennsylvania in November, and South Carolina in August, in
    their respective states.

In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be
    nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and
    third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have
    made or will make payments for their members or insured patients
    being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been
    consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under
    certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil
    RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the
    cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and
    attorneys’ fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the
    EDNY in 2006 on similar grounds. In September 2008, Judge
    Weinstein certified a class consisting of third-party payors,
    excluding governmental entities and individual consumers. We
    appealed the certification order, and Judge Weinstein’s
    order denying our motion for summary judgment, in September
    2008. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund
    brought claims in state court in Pennsylvania as insurer of
    Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa on
    similar grounds as described in the New York cases. As with the
    product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we
    inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa
    and improperly promoted the drug. The Pennsylvania case is set
    for trial in October 2009.

We cannot determine with certainty the additional number of
    lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. The ultimate
    resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation
    could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results
    of operations, liquidity, and financial position.

In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other
    product liability lawsuits involving primarily
    diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thimerosal. The majority of these
    claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and
    coverage limits.

Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible
    that we could become subject to large numbers of product
    liability and related claims for other products in the future.
    In the past few years, we have experienced difficulties in
    obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive
    insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our
    currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we
    will continue to be completely self-insured for future product
    liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we
    will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the
    future.

Environmental
    Matters

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
    and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, we have been
    designated as one of several potentially responsible parties
    with respect to fewer than 10 sites. Under Superfund, each
    responsible party may be jointly and severally liable for the
    entire amount of the cleanup. We also continue remediation of
    certain of our own sites. We have accrued for estimated
    Superfund cleanup costs, remediation, and certain other
    environmental matters. This takes into account, as applicable,
    available information regarding site conditions, potential
    cleanup methods, estimated costs, and the extent to which other
    parties can be expected to contribute to payment of those costs.
    We have limited liability insurance coverage for certain
    environmental liabilities.

The amounts above are net of income taxes. The income taxes
    associated with the unrecognized net actuarial losses and prior
    service costs on our defined benefit pension and retiree health
    benefit plans (Note 13) were a benefit of
    $1.02 billion for 2008. The income taxes related to the
    other components of comprehensive income were not significant,
    as income taxes were not provided for foreign currency
    translation.

The unrealized gains (losses) on securities is net of
    reclassification adjustments of $1.7 million,
    $5.8 million, and $16.9 million, net of tax, in 2008,
    2007, and 2006, respectively, for net realized gains on sales of
    securities included in net income. The effective portion of cash
    flow hedges is net of reclassification adjustments of
    $9.6 million, $8.8 million, and $2.3 million, net
    of tax, in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, for realized
    losses on foreign currency options and $7.9 million,
    $11.6 million, and $17.1 million, net of tax, in 2008,
    2007, and 2006, respectively, for interest expense on interest
    rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges.

Generally, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are
    translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange
    rate. For those operations, changes in exchange rates generally
    do not affect cash flows; therefore, resulting translation
    adjustments are made in shareholders’ equity rather than in
    income.

Management’s
    Reports

Management’s
    Report for Financial Statements — Eli Lilly and
    Company and Subsidiaries

Management of Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries is
    responsible for the accuracy, integrity, and fair presentation
    of the financial statements. The statements have been prepared
    in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
    the United States and include amounts based on judgments and
    estimates by management. In management’s opinion, the
    consolidated financial statements present fairly our financial
    position, results of operations, and cash flows.

In addition to the system of internal accounting controls, we
    maintain a code of conduct (known as

The Red Book

) that
    applies to all employees worldwide, requiring proper overall
    business conduct, avoidance of conflicts of interest, compliance
    with laws, and confidentiality of proprietary information.

The Red Book

is reviewed on a periodic basis with
    employees worldwide, and all employees are required to report
    suspected violations. A hotline number is published in

The
    Red Book

to enable employees to report suspected violations
    anonymously. Employees who report suspected violations are
    protected from discrimination or retaliation by the company. In
    addition to

The Red Book

, the CEO, and all financial
    management must sign a financial code of ethics, which further
    reinforces their fiduciary responsibilities.

The consolidated financial statements have been audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm. Their responsibility is to examine our
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Ernst &
    Young’s opinion with respect to the fairness of the
    presentation of the statements (see opinion on
    page 66) is included in our annual report.
    Ernst & Young reports directly to the audit committee
    of the board of directors.

Our audit committee includes five nonemployee members of the
    board of directors, all of whom are independent from our
    company. The committee charter, which is published in the proxy
    statement, outlines the members’ roles and responsibilities
    and is consistent with enacted corporate reform laws and
    regulations. It is the audit committee’s responsibility to
    appoint an independent registered public accounting firm subject
    to shareholder ratification, approve both audit and nonaudit
    services performed by the independent registered public
    accounting firm, and review the reports submitted by the firm.
    The audit committee meets several times during the year with
    management, the internal auditors, and the independent public
    accounting firm to discuss audit activities, internal controls,
    and financial reporting matters, including reviews of our
    externally published financial results. The internal auditors

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting —
    Eli Lilly and Company and Subsidiaries

Management of Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We have global
    financial policies that govern critical areas, including
    internal controls, financial accounting and reporting, fiduciary
    accountability, and safeguarding of corporate assets. Our
    internal accounting control systems are designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that
    transactions are executed in accordance with management’s
    authorization and are properly recorded, and that accounting
    records are adequate for preparation of financial statements and
    other financial information. A staff of internal auditors
    regularly monitors, on a worldwide basis, the adequacy and
    effectiveness of internal accounting controls. The general
    auditor reports directly to the audit committee of the board of
    directors.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on our evaluation under this framework, we
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2008. However, because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
    in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The internal control over financial reporting has been assessed
    by Ernst & Young LLP. Their responsibility is to
    evaluate whether internal control over financial reporting was
    designed and operating effectively.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Shareholders

Eli Lilly and Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, cash flows, and comprehensive income (loss) (pages
    43 through 48 and pages 52 through 84) for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Eli
    Lilly and Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    February 16, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

As discussed in Note 12 to the financial statements, in
    2007 Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries adopted a new
    accounting pronouncement for income taxes.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Shareholders

Eli Lilly and Company

We have audited Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries’
    internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
    2008, based on criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Eli Lilly and Company and
    subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    2008 consolidated financial statements of Eli Lilly and Company
    and subsidiaries and our report dated February 16, 2009,
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Item 9A.

Controls and
    Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

Under applicable SEC regulations, management of a reporting
    company, with the participation of the principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer, must periodically
    evaluate the company’s “disclosure controls and
    procedures,” which are defined generally as controls and
    other procedures of a reporting company designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed by the reporting company in
    its periodic reports filed with the commission (such as this

Form 10-K)

is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely
    basis.

Our management, with the participation of John C.
    Lechleiter, Ph.D., chairman, president, and chief executive
    officer, and Derica W. Rice, senior vice president and chief
    financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and
    procedures as of December 31, 2008, and concluded that they
    are effective.

Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting

Dr. Lechleiter and Mr. Rice provided a report on
    behalf of management on our internal control over financial
    reporting, in which management concluded that the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting is effective at
    December 31, 2008. In addition, Ernst & Young
    LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, provided an attestation report on the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting. You can find the full
    text of management’s report and Ernst &
    Young’s attestation report in Part II, Item 8,
    and both reports are incorporated by reference in this Item.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

During the fourth quarter of 2008, there were no changes in our
    internal control over financial reporting that materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting.
