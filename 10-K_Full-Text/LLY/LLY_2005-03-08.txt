Business

Eli Lilly and Company (the “Company” or “Registrant”, which may be referred to as “we”, “us”,
or “our”) was incorporated in 1901 in Indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded
in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. We discover, develop, manufacture, and
sell products in one significant business segment—pharmaceutical products. We also have an animal
health business segment, whose operations are not material to our financial statements. We
manufacture and distribute our products through owned or leased facilities in the United States,
Puerto Rico, and 22 other countries. Our products are sold in approximately 140 countries.

Most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists, and our
success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative new
pharmaceutical products. We direct our research efforts primarily toward the search for products
to prevent and treat human diseases. We also conduct research to find products to treat diseases
in animals and to increase the efficiency of animal food production.

Marketing

We sell most of our products worldwide. We adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in
various countries to meet local needs.

Pharmaceuticals – United States

In the United States, we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through independent
wholesale distributors. Our marketing policy is designed to assure that products and relevant
medical information are immediately available to physicians, pharmacies, hospitals, and appropriate
health care professionals throughout the country. Three wholesale distributors in the United
States – AmerisourceBergen

-2-


Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and McKesson Corporation – each
accounted for between 13 and 17 percent of our worldwide consolidated net sales in 2004. No other
distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales. We also sell
pharmaceutical products directly to the United States government and other manufacturers, but those
sales are not material. Beginning in 2005, we have restructured our arrangements with our U.S.
wholesalers. We believe that the new arrangements will provide us
with competitive distribution costs as well as more reliable data about
wholesaler inventory levels, and will reduce the speculative buying by wholesalers that has
sometimes affected U.S. sales growth trends for certain products.

We promote our major pharmaceutical products in the United States through sales representatives who
call upon physicians, wholesalers, hospitals, managed-care organizations, retail pharmacists, and
other health care professionals. We advertise in medical and drug journals, distribute literature
and samples of certain products to physicians, and exhibit at medical meetings. In addition, we
advertise certain products directly to consumers in the United States and we maintain web sites
with information about all our major products. Divisions of our sales force are assigned to
product lines or practice areas, such as primary care, neuroscience, acute care, endocrinology, and
oncology.

Large purchasers of pharmaceuticals, such as managed-care groups, government agencies, and
long-term care institutions, account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical purchases in
the United States. We have created special sales groups to service managed-care organizations,
government and long-term care institutions, hospital contract administrators, and certain retail
pharmacies. In response to competitive pressures, we have entered into arrangements with a number
of these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more Lilly products or other
cost-sharing arrangements.

Pharmaceuticals – Outside the United States

Outside the United States, we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily through sales
representatives. While the products marketed vary from country to country, neuroscience products
constitute the largest single group in total sales. Distribution patterns vary from country to
country. In most countries, we maintain our own sales and distribution organizations. In some
countries, however, we market our products through independent distributors.

Pharmaceutical Marketing Collaborations

Several of our significant products are marketed in collaboration with other pharmaceutical
companies:

We have also entered into licensing arrangements under which we have granted exclusive marketing
rights to other companies in specified countries for certain older products manufactured by us,
such as Permax, Sarafem, Vancocin, the anti-ulcer agent Axid

®

, the analgesic Darvon

®

, and the
anti-infectives Ceclor, Keflex

®

, Keftab

®

, and Lorabid

®

.

Animal Health Products

Our Elanco Animal Health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the United States to
market animal health products. Elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the United States.
Elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors.

Raw Materials and Product Supply

Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more
than one source. We obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source. In addition,
three of our significant products are manufactured by others: Actos by Takeda; ReoPro by Centocor;
and Xigris by Lonza Biologics (bulk product) and DSM, N.V. (finished product). If we were unable
to obtain certain materials from present sources, we could experience an interruption in supply
until we established new sources or, in some cases, implemented alternative processes.

Our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at three sites in Indiana as well as locations in Ireland,
Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. Finishing operations, including labeling and packaging, take
place at a number of sites throughout the world.

We seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and maintain inventory in a way that
will allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate
manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. However,
pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary widely from product to
product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring
significant capital expenditures. Accordingly, if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns
or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand, we could experience an interruption in supply of
certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded.

Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights

Overview

Intellectual property protection is, in the aggregate, material to our ability to successfully
commercialize our life sciences innovations. We own, have applied for, or are licensed under, a
large number of patents, both in the United States and in other countries, relating to products,
product uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. There is no assurance that the patents we
are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been granted would be found valid and
enforceable if challenged. Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations,
or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or from
marketing alternative products or formulations that might successfully compete with our patented
products.

Outside the United States, the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for
pharmaceuticals varies widely. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement
(TRIPs) administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO), over 140 countries have now agreed to
provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that
adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners. However, in many countries, this
agreement will not become fully effective for many years. It is still too soon to assess when and
how much, if at all, we will benefit commercially from these changes.

-4-


When a product patent expires, the patent holder often loses effective market exclusivity for the
product. This can result in a severe and rapid decline in sales of the formerly patented product,
particularly in the United States. However, in some cases the innovator company may achieve
exclusivity beyond the expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade secrets;
later-expiring patents on methods of use or formulations; or data-based exclusivity that may be
available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.

Our Intellectual Property Portfolio

We consider intellectual property protection for certain products, processes, and uses –
particularly that relating to Zyprexa, Gemzar, Humalog, Evista, Actos, ReoPro, Xigris, Strattera,
Cialis, Alimta, and Cymbalta – to be important to our operations. For many of our products, in
addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes, formulations, or
uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent.

United States compound patent expirations include those claiming the respective active ingredients
in Zyprexa, 2011; Humalog, 2013; and ReoPro, 2015. The Gemzar compound patent in the U.S. expires
in 2010, but a method-of-use patent covering treatment of neoplasms with Gemzar is in force until
2012. We hold a number of U.S. patents covering Evista and its approved uses in osteoporosis
prevention and treatment that we believe should provide us exclusivity in the United States until
at least 2012. In the United States, the Actos compound patent extends beyond the duration of our
co-promotion agreement, which is in force until 2006. Xigris is a complex glycoprotein biologic
product that is produced through recombinant DNA technology. Xigris is not subject to the
Abbreviated New Drug Application process under the Hatch-Waxman law as described below. In
addition, we hold patents on the DNA materials, certain uses, manufacturing process, and the
glycoprotein itself. We believe the intellectual property protection for Xigris should provide us
marketing exclusivity in the U.S. until 2015. For Strattera, a method-of-use patent in the U.S.
for treating attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder should provide exclusivity until 2016. For
Cialis, compound and method-of-use patent protection exists in the U.S. that should provide
exclusivity until 2017. The U.S. compound patent for Alimta expires in 2011 but we have applied
for a patent term extension that we expect will extend the patent until 2016. For Cymbalta, the
U.S. compound patent expires in 2008 but we have applied for a patent term extension that we expect
will extend the patent until 2013. We also have a formulation patent for Cymbalta until 2014.

Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to
be important to our operations. Trademark protection varies throughout the world, with protection
continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used, and in other countries as long as it is
registered. Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms.

Patent Challenges Under the Hatch-Waxman Act

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as
“Hatch-Waxman,” made a complex set of changes to both patent and new-drug-approval laws in the
United States. Before Hatch-Waxman, no drug could be approved without providing the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) complete safety and efficacy studies,

i.e.

, a complete New Drug Application
(NDA). Hatch-Waxman authorizes the FDA to approve generic versions of innovative medicines without
such information by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). In an ANDA, the generic
manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the
NDA-approved drug – not safety and efficacy.

Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after the innovator’s
patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic
manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s
NDA are invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a “Paragraph IV
certification.” The

-5-


innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its
patents. If one or more of the NDA-listed patents are successfully challenged, the first filer of
a Paragraph IV certification may be entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity over all
other generic manufacturers.

In recent years, generic manufacturers have used Paragraph IV certifications extensively to
challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals, and we expect this trend to
continue. We are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their
Paragraph IV certifications on Zyprexa, Evista, and Sarafem. In the Sarafem litigation, we
prevailed at trial and the challenger has appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
For more information on the Zyprexa and Evista patent litigation, see Part 1, Item 3, Legal
Proceedings.

Competition

Our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in
highly competitive markets throughout the world. Our animal health products compete on a worldwide
basis with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical, chemical, and other
companies that operate animal health divisions or subsidiaries.

Important competitive factors include product efficacy, safety, and ease of use, price and
demonstrated cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, service, and research and development of
new products and processes. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes
with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or
decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other
products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. Manufacturers
of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than
research-based pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower
than branded products. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it
normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. In many countries
outside the United States, patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with
generic or “knockoff” versions of our products. To successfully compete for business with managed
care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products
offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care.

We believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and
developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, together with our
ability to continuously improve the productivity of our discovery, development, manufacturing,
marketing and support operations in a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance
that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that
our products or processes will not become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products
or processes developed by our competitors.

Government Regulation

Our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national, state and local agencies. The
lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing development, and
regulatory review necessary for required governmental approvals is extremely costly and can
significantly delay product introductions in a given market. Promotion, marketing, manufacturing,
and distribution of pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all
major world markets. We are required to conduct extensive post-marketing surveillance of the
safety of the products we sell. In addition, our operations are subject to complex federal, state,
local, and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. The laws
and regulations affecting the manufacture

-6-


and sale of current products and the introduction of new
products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort, time, and expense
and significant capital investment.

Of particular importance is the FDA in the United States. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over virtually all of our businesses and administers
requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, quality control,
distribution, labeling, marketing, advertising, dissemination of information and post-marketing
surveillance of our pharmaceutical products. The FDA, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA), also regulates our animal health products. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also
regulates some animal health products.

New drugs may now be approved across the European Union (EU) using the European Commission’s
centralized approval process or using the national mutual recognition process. The use of either of
these procedures provides a more consistent and, in some cases, a more rapid approval within the EU
member states than was the case when each member state operated its own approval process.

The FDA extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality under its current Good
Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations. In recent years, we have made, and we continue to
make, substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive,
company-wide improvements in our manufacturing, product and process development, and quality
operations to ensure sustained cGMP compliance. However, in the event we fail to adhere to cGMP
requirements in the future, we could be subject to interruptions in production, civil and criminal
penalties, and delays in new product approvals.

The marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the
manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers, are subject to various
other federal and state laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute and the False Claims Act
and state laws governing kickbacks and false claims. These laws are administered by, among others,
the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human
Services, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Personnel Management and state attorneys
general. Over the past several years, both the FDA and many of these other agencies have increased
their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. Over this period, several
cases brought by these agencies against other companies under these and other laws have resulted in
corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements. Several pharmaceutical
companies, including Lilly, are currently subject to proceedings by one or more of these agencies
regarding marketing and promotional practices. See Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” for
information about currently pending marketing and promotional practices investigations in which we
are involved. It is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal
proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties (including treble damages
under the False Claims Act), criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion
from federal health care programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in such an action could
have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial
position.

In the United States, we are required to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of
certain of our products under state Medicaid programs. Other cost containment measures have been
adopted or proposed by federal, state, and local government entities that provide or pay for health
care. In most international markets, we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost
containment programs, which may include price controls, reference pricing, discounts and rebates,
restrictions on physician prescription levels, restrictions on reimbursement, compulsory licenses,
health economic assessments, and generic substitution.

In the U.S., we expect branded pharmaceutical products to be subject to increasing pricing
pressures. Implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of

-7-


(MMA), providing a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program, will take effect
January 1, 2006. While it is difficult to predict the business impact of this legislation prior to
2006, we currently anticipate a relatively neutral short-term impact due to offsets of price and
volume in various customer groups. However, in the long term there is additional risk associated
with increased pricing pressures. While the MMA prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human
Services (HHS) from directly negotiating prescription drug prices with manufacturers, we expect
continued challenges to that prohibition over the next several years. Also, the MMA retains the
authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to prohibit the importation of prescription
drugs, but we expect Congress to consider several measures that could remove that authority and
allow for the importation of products into the U.S. regardless of their safety or cost. If
adopted, such legislation would likely have a negative effect on our U.S. sales. We are encouraged
by the release of the HHS Task Force Report on Importation, which concludes that the safety and
possible cost savings of an importation scheme are questionable.

As a result of the passage of the MMA, aged and disabled patients jointly eligible for Medicare and
Medicaid will receive their prescription drug benefits through Medicare, instead of Medicaid,
beginning January 1, 2006. This may relieve some state budget pressures but is unlikely to result
in reduced pricing pressures. A majority of states have begun to implement supplemental rebates
and restricted formularies in their Medicaid programs, and these programs are expected to continue
in the post-MMA environment. Several states are also attempting to extend discounted Medicaid
prices to non-Medicaid patients. Additionally, notwithstanding the federal law prohibiting
pharmaceutical importation, nine states have implemented importation schemes for their citizens,
usually involving a website that links patients to selected Canadian pharmacies. One state has
such a program for its state employees. In the absence of federal action to curtail state
activities, we expect other states to launch importation efforts. As a result, we expect pressures
on pharmaceutical pricing to continue.

International operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and
there are many proposals for additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that would
directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual
property protection.

We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential
future legislative or regulatory developments. However, we expect that pressures on pharmaceutical
pricing will continue in the near term.

Research and Development

Our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years. Our research and
development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we
offer today. We invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our
long-term competitiveness. At the end of 2004, we employed approximately 8,450 people in
pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities, including a substantial
number of physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees, and highly skilled
technical personnel. Our research and development expenses were $2.15 billion in 2002, $2.35
billion in 2003, and $2.69 billion in 2004.

To improve productivity, in 2004 we terminated our research in the area of inflammation and
reallocated resources to other areas of R&D, thus narrowing our pharmaceutical research and
development focus from five to four therapeutic categories: central nervous system and related
diseases; endocrine diseases, including diabetes and osteoporosis; cancer; and cardiovascular
diseases. However, we remain opportunistic, selectively pursuing promising leads in other
therapeutic areas. We are actively engaged in biotechnology research programs involving
recombinant DNA, therapeutic proteins and antibodies as well as genomics (the development of
therapeutics through identification of disease-causing genes and their cellular function),
biomarkers, and targeted therapeutics. In addition to discovering and developing new chemical
entities, we look for ways to expand the value of existing products through new uses and

-8-


formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients. We also conduct research in the
animal sciences, including animal nutrition and physiology, control of parasites, and veterinary
medicine.

To supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others, including educational institutions
and research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and we contract with others for the
performance of research in their facilities. We use the services of physicians, hospitals, medical
schools, and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the
safety and effectiveness of our products. We actively seek out investments in external research
and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts.
These investments can take many forms, including licensing arrangements, co-development and
co-marketing agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, and acquisitions.

Drug development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. On average, only one out of many
thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and
safe enough to become an approved medicine. The process from discovery to regulatory approval
typically takes 12 to 15 years or longer. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and
even late-stage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval. We believe our
investments in research, both internally and in collaboration with others, have been rewarded by
the number of new compounds and new indications for existing compounds that we have in all stages
of development. Among our new investigational compounds in the later stages of development are
potential therapies for diabetes and its complications, osteoporosis, cancer, and acute coronary
syndromes. Further, we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of
development, including compounds targeting cancers, thrombotic disorders, atherosclerosis,
Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, obesity, and sleep disorders. We are also developing new uses and
formulations for many of our important currently marketed products, such as Alimta, Cialis,
Cymbalta, Evista, ReoPro, and Symbyax.

Quality Assurance

Our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products
and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness. Product quality
arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations, including research and
development, purchasing, facilities planning, manufacturing, and distribution. We have implemented
quality-assurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of scientific information and
production processes.

Control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients, equipment,
facilities, manufacturing methods, packaging materials, and labeling. We perform tests at various
stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all
regulatory requirements and our standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical chemical
analyses, microbiological testing, testing in animals, or a combination. Additional assurance of
quality is provided by a corporate quality-assurance group that monitors existing pharmaceutical
and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company, subsidiaries and
affiliates, and third-party suppliers.

Executive Officers of the Company

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers. All
executive officers have been employed by the Company in executive positions during the last five
years.

The term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the
Board of Directors, to be held on April 18, 2005, or on the date his or her successor is chosen and
qualified. No director or executive officer of the Company has a “family relationship” with any
other director or executive officer of the Company, as that term is defined for purposes of this
disclosure requirement.

Financial Information Relating to Business Segments and Classes of Products

You can find financial information relating to our business segments and classes of products
in our 2004 Annual Report at page 27 under “Segment Information” (page 19 of Exhibit 13 to this
Form 10-K). That information is incorporated into this report by reference.

The relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated net sales changes from year
to year. This is due to several factors, including the introduction of new products by us and by
other manufacturers and the introduction of generic pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations. In
addition, margins vary for our different products due to various factors, including differences in
the cost to manufacture and market the products, the value of the products to the marketplace, and
government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement. Our major product sales are generally not
seasonal.

Financial Information Relating to Foreign and Domestic Operations

You can find financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations in our 2004
Annual Report at page 27 under “Segment Information” (page 19 of Exhibit 13). That information is
incorporated in this Report by reference.

To date, our overall operations abroad have not been significantly deterred by local restrictions
on the transfer of funds from branches and subsidiaries located abroad, including the availability
of dollar exchange. We cannot predict what effect these restrictions or the other risks inherent
in foreign operations, including possible nationalization, might have on our future operations or
what other restrictions may be imposed in the future. In addition, changing currency values can
either favorably or unfavorably affect our financial position and results of operations. We
actively manage foreign exchange risk through various hedging techniques including the use of
foreign currency contracts.

Item 2.

Properties

Our principal domestic and international executive offices are located in Indianapolis. At
December 31, 2004, we owned 13 production and distribution facilities in the United States and
Puerto Rico. Together with the corporate administrative offices, these facilities contain an
aggregate of approximately 11.7 million square feet of floor area dedicated to production,
distribution, and administration. Major production sites include Indianapolis; Clinton and
Lafayette, Indiana; and Carolina and Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. We are constructing a new production
facility in Prince William County, Virginia.

We own production and distribution facilities in 13 countries outside the United States and Puerto
Rico, containing an aggregate of approximately 4.2 million square feet of floor space. Major
production sites include facilities in the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Brazil,
and Mexico. We lease production and warehouse facilities in Puerto Rico and several countries
outside the United States.

Our research and development facilities in the United States consist of approximately 4.4 million
square feet and are located primarily in Indianapolis and Greenfield, Indiana. Our major research
and development facilities abroad are located in Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and
Spain and contain an aggregate of approximately 650,000 square feet.

We believe that none of our properties is subject to any encumbrance, easement, or other
restriction that would detract materially from its value or impair its use in the operation of the
business. The buildings we own are of varying ages and in good condition.

Item 3.      Legal Proceedings

We are a party to various currently pending legal actions, government investigations, and
environmental proceedings, and we anticipate that such actions could be brought against us in the
future. The most significant of these matters are described below. While it is not possible to
predict or determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations and proceedings described
below, we believe that, except as otherwise specifically noted below with respect to the U.S.
Zyprexa and Evista patent litigation, the Zyprexa product liability litigation, and the U.S.
marketing practices investigation involving Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weekly, the resolution of
all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or
liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one
accounting period.

Zyprexa Patent Litigation

Three generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Zenith), Dr.
Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (Reddy) and Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva) have submitted abbreviated new
drug applications (ANDAs) seeking permission to market generic versions of Zyprexa in various
dosage forms and formulations (including the Zydis® formulation) several years prior to the
expiration of our U.S. patents for the product, alleging that our patents are invalid, not
infringed, or unenforceable. In April 2001, we filed suit against Zenith in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of Indiana seeking a ruling that the challenges to our compound
patent (expiring in 2011) are without merit. We filed similar suits in the same court against Reddy
in June 2001 and Teva in September 2002. The cases have been consolidated. A trial before a
district court judge in Indianapolis was held in January and February of 2004 and we are awaiting a
ruling from the trial court. Regardless of the trial court’s ruling, we anticipate that appeals
will follow. If we are unsuccessful at the trial court level, we cannot predict whether any of the
generic companies would launch generic versions of Zyprexa prior to a final resolution of any
appeals.

In October 2004 we were notified that Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr) submitted an ANDA seeking
permission to market the Zydis formulation of Zyprexa, asserting that our patents covering Zydis
are invalid, not infringed, or unenforceable. In December 2004 we filed suit against Barr in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana seeking a ruling that Barr’s patent
challenges are without merit. That suit has now been stayed pending the decision of the trial
court in the Zenith/Reddy/Teva case described above.

We believe that the generic manufacturers’ claims are without merit and we expect to prevail in
this litigation. However, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this
litigation and, accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable
outcome would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity,
and financial position.

In May 2004, Egis-Gyogyszergyar, a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer, challenged the validity
of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patents (expiring in 2011) in Germany. We currently
anticipate a decision from the German Patent Court in 2006. In addition to our patents, we have
data package exclusivity in Germany through September 2006. We are vigorously contesting the legal
challenge to this patent. We cannot predict or determine the outcome of this litigation.

-12-


Other Patent Litigation

In October 2002, we were notified that Barr had submitted an ANDA with the U.S. FDA seeking
permission to market a generic version of Evista several years prior to the expiration of our U.S.
patents covering the product, alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed. In November
2002, we filed suit against Barr in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana
seeking a ruling that Barr’s challenges to our patents claiming the method of use and
pharmaceutical form (expiring from 2012 to 2017) are without merit. Recently, Barr has also
asserted that the method-of-use patents are unenforceable. On September 28, 2004, the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office issued to us a new patent (expiring in 2017) directed to pharmaceutical
compositions containing raloxifene. Barr has challenged this patent, alleging that the patent is
invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed. This patent has been added to the
lawsuit. The suit is in discovery and the trial is now scheduled to begin in February 2006.
While we believe that Barr’s claims are without merit and expect to prevail, it is not possible to
predict or determine the outcome of the litigation. Therefore, we can provide no assurance that we
will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.

In October 2002, Pfizer Inc. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court in Delaware
against us, Lilly ICOS LLC, and ICOS Corporation alleging that the proposed marketing of Cialis for
erectile dysfunction would infringe its newly issued method-of-use patent. In September 2003, the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, on its own initiative, ordered that Pfizer’s patent be
reexamined. The Delaware suit has been stayed pending the outcome of the reexamination.
Previously, Pfizer’s corresponding European method-of-use patent was held invalid in the first
stage of an opposition proceeding in the European Patent Office. Pfizer has appealed that
decision, and in February 2005, the Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office revoked
Pfizer’s method-of-use patent in its entirety. The U.K. Court of Appeal has also held the U.K.
counterpart to this patent invalid. Litigation relating to the corresponding patent is also
pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and South Africa. We intend to vigorously defend
this litigation and expect to prevail. However, it is not possible to predict or determine the
outcome of this litigation and therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail.

Product Liability Litigation

We are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability lawsuits in the United States
involving primarily Zyprexa, diethylstilbestrol (“DES”) and thimerosal.

We have been named in approximately 140 product liability cases in the United States involving
approximately 360 claimants alleging a variety of injuries from the administration of Zyprexa.
Most of the cases allege that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high

blood-glucose
levels. The suits seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of
inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa, and many of the suits also
allege that we improperly promoted the drug. We are vigorously defending these suits. All the
federal cases, involving approximately 330 claimants, have been or will be transferred to The
Honorable Jack Weinstein in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for
consolidated and coordinated pretrial proceedings. Two cases requesting certification of
nationwide class actions on behalf of those who allegedly suffered injuries from the administration
of Zyprexa were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on April 16,
2004, and May 19, 2004, respectively. The cases seek damages for alleged personal injuries and
also seek compensation for medical monitoring of individuals who have taken Zyprexa. A lawsuit was
also filed that requests a class action on behalf of Iowa residents who took Zyprexa, and that case
has been transferred to the federal court in New York. In addition, we have entered into
agreements with various plaintiffs’ counsel halting the running of the statutes of limitation
(tolling agreements) with respect to more than 3,050 individuals who do not have lawsuits on file
and may or may not eventually file suits. This provides counsel additional time to evaluate the
potential claims. In exchange, the individuals have agreed not to file suits in state courts and
the

-13-


Plaintiffs Steering Committee agreed to dismiss the personal injury claims in the two pending
nationwide class actions. The class action claims seeking medical monitoring for Zyprexa patients
are not affected by this agreement.

In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in Louisiana on behalf of
the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to
diabetes or high blood-glucose levels and that we improperly promoted the drug. In these actions,
which we have removed to federal court, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the
costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug benefit programs and the costs the
department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses.

In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of
patients who took Zyprexa. The allegations in these suits are similar to those in the litigation
pending in the United States.

The number of product liability lawsuits and tolled claims relating to Zyprexa continues
to increase, and we cannot predict at this time the additional number of lawsuits and claims that
may be asserted. As noted, we are vigorously defending this litigation. However, product
litigation of this type is inherently unpredictable, with the risk of excessive verdicts not
justified by the evidence. Accordingly, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the Zyprexa
product liability litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
operations, liquidity, and financial position.

In approximately 125 U.S. actions involving approximately 200 claimants, plaintiffs seek to recover
damages on behalf of children or grandchildren of women who were prescribed DES during pregnancy.

We have been named as a defendant in approximately 340 actions in the U.S., involving approximately
1,020 claimants, brought in various state courts and federal district courts on behalf of children
with autism or other neurological disorders who received childhood vaccines (manufactured by other
companies) that contained thimerosal, a generic preservative used in certain vaccines in the U.S.
from the 1930s until approximately 2000. We purchased patents and conducted research pertaining to
thimerosal in the 1920s. We have been named in the suits even though we discontinued manufacturing
the raw material in 1974 and discontinued selling it in the United States to vaccine manufacturers
in 1992. The lawsuits typically name the vaccine manufacturers as well as Lilly and other
distributors of thimerosal, and allege that the children’s exposure to thimerosal-containing
vaccines caused their autism or other neurological disorders. We strongly deny any liability in
these cases. There is no credible scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between
thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism or other neurological disorders. In addition, we believe
the cases should not be prosecuted in the courts in which they have been brought because the
underlying claims are subject to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. Implemented in
1988, the Act established a mandatory, federally administered no-fault claims process for
individuals who allege that they were harmed by the administration of childhood vaccines. Under
the Act, claims must first be brought before the U.S. Court of Claims for an award determination
under the compensation guidelines established pursuant to the Act. Claimants who are unsatisfied
with their awards under the Act may reject the award and seek traditional judicial remedies.

We have obtained product liability insurance from commercial carriers providing coverage with
respect to the claims involving the products noted above, subject to deductibles, self-insurance
and coverage limits. However, there can be no assurance that the coverage amounts will be
sufficient to cover all exposures or that the carriers will not assert defenses to coverage. In
addition, as a result of external events, product liability insurance has become much more
difficult to obtain. Consequently, product liability claims could
produce exposures that we would manage largely as self-insured risks.

-14-


Marketing Practices Investigations

In July 2002, we received a grand jury subpoena for documents from the Office of Consumer
Litigation, Department of Justice, related to our marketing and promotional practices and physician
communications with respect to Evista. We received subpoenas seeking additional documents in July
2003, July 2004, and August 2004. We have provided a broad range of information concerning our U.S.
marketing and promotional practices, including documents relating to communications with physicians
and the remuneration of physician consultants and advisers. We continue to cooperate with the
government and are currently in advanced discussions to resolve the matter. In the fourth quarter
of 2004 we recorded a provision for $36.0 million, which we believe will be sufficient to resolve
the matter.

In March 2004, the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania advised us
that it has commenced a civil investigation relating to our U.S. marketing and promotional
practices with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac and Prozac Weekly. We are cooperating with the U.S.
Attorney in this investigation and are providing a broad range of documents and information
relating to the investigation, including documents relating to communications with physicians and
the remuneration of physician consultants and advisers. It is possible that other Lilly products
could become subject to this investigation and that the outcome of this matter could include
criminal charges and fines and/or civil penalties. We cannot predict or determine the outcome of
this matter or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that
might result from an adverse outcome. It is possible, however, that an adverse outcome could have
a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial
position. We have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based
compliance program that includes comprehensive compliance-related activities designed to ensure
that our marketing and promotional practices, physician communications, and remuneration of health
care professionals comply with promotional laws and regulations.

In August 2003, we received notice that the staff of the SEC is conducting an investigation into
the compliance by Polish subsidiaries of certain pharmaceutical companies, including Lilly, with
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. The staff has issued subpoenas to us requesting
production of documents related to the investigation. We are cooperating with the SEC in
responding to the investigation.

Other Matters

In March 2001, we received a subpoena, issued at the request of the Commonwealth’s attorney for the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for production of documents related to pricing and Medicaid
reimbursement of our products in Massachusetts. We are not the only pharmaceutical company to
receive such a request. We cooperated with the inquiry and have received no further requests. We
believe that all of our practices have been lawful and proper.

In 2003, three counties in New York (Suffolk, Rockland, and Westchester) sued us and many other
pharmaceutical manufacturers, claiming in general that as a result of alleged improprieties by the
manufacturers in the calculation and reporting of average wholesale prices for purposes of Medicaid
reimbursement, the counties overpaid their portion of the cost of pharmaceuticals. In 2004, Nassau
County and New York City filed similar suits. The suits seek monetary and other relief, including
civil penalties and treble damages. The five New York suits have been transferred to the U.S.
District Court for the District of Massachusetts for pretrial proceedings (along with several other
suits to which Lilly is not a party). Litigation activity in the New York cases has been stayed
pending a decision on a motion to dismiss. A motion to dismiss that was filed by all of the
defendants in the Suffolk County case has been granted in part and denied in part. Our individual
motion to dismiss has been granted in part, and we are awaiting a ruling on the remaining
issues. Because of the similarities of the New York cases, the court’s ruling in the
Suffolk County case will likely set a precedent in the other cases. In July 2004, Central Alabama
Comprehensive Healthcare, Inc. filed a similar suit in Alabama relating to Public Health

-15-


Service pricing. The suit seeks injunctive and monetary relief. The allegations in the lawsuit are based
on a report issued by the Office of the Inspector General for Health and Human Services (OIG) that
was subsequently withdrawn by the OIG because it was based on flawed data. We and the other
defendants have filed motions to dismiss, which are pending. While we are vigorously defending all
these cases, given their early procedural stage, we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this
litigation.

During 2004 we, along with several other pharmaceutical companies, were named in one consolidated
case in Minnesota federal court brought on behalf of consumers alleging that the conduct of
pharmaceutical companies in preventing commercial importation of prescription drugs from outside
the United States violated antitrust laws and one case in California state court brought by several
pharmacies in which plaintiffs’ claims are less specifically stated, but seem to be substantially
similar to the claims asserted in Minnesota. The Minnesota case seeks a class action
certification. Both cases seek restitution for alleged overpayments for pharmaceuticals and an
injunction against the allegedly violative conduct. We and the other defendants have filed a
motion to dismiss in the Minnesota case, which is pending. The magistrate judge has recommended that
the motion to dismiss be granted as to the federal claims and denied as to the
state law claims. In the California case, the court has
granted a motion to dismiss by the defendants but permitted the plaintiffs to re-file their
complaint, which plaintiffs have now done. While we intend to vigorously defend these suits, given
their early procedural stage, we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this litigation.

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund, we have been designated as one of several potentially responsible parties with respect
to the cleanup of fewer than 10 sites. Under Superfund, each responsible party may be jointly and
severally liable for the entire amount of the cleanup.

We are also a defendant in other litigation and investigations, including product liability and
patent suits, of a character we regard as normal to our business.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under applicable SEC regulations, management of a reporting company, with the participation of the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, must periodically evaluate the
company’s “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined generally as controls and other
procedures of a reporting company designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the reporting company in its periodic reports filed with the commission (such as this Form 10-K) is
recorded, processed,

-18-


summarized, and reported on a timely basis.

Our management, with the participation of Sidney Taurel, chairman, president, and chief executive
officer, and Charles E. Golden, executive vice president and chief financial officer, evaluated our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2004, and concluded that they are effective.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In our 2004 Annual Report, Messrs. Taurel and Golden provided a report on behalf of management on
our internal control over financial reporting, in which management concluded that the company’s
internal control over financial reporting is effective at December 31, 2004. In addition, Ernst & Young LLP, the
