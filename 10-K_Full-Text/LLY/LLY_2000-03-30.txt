Item 1.
   Business

Eli Lilly and Company (the
   “Company” or “Registrant”, which may be referred to as
   “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in 1901
   in Indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in
   Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. We discover, develop,
   manufacture, and sell products in one significant business segment
   —pharmaceutical products. Operations of our animal health business
   segment are not material to our financial statements. We manufacture and
   distribute our products through owned or leased facilities in the United
   States, Puerto Rico, and 28 other countries. Our products are sold in
   approximately 160 countries.

Most of the products we sell today
   were discovered or developed by our own scientists, and our success depends
   to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop
   innovative new pharmaceutical products. We direct our research efforts
   primarily toward the search for products to diagnose, prevent and treat
   human diseases. We also conduct research to find products to treat diseases
   in animals and to increase the efficiency of animal food
   production.

In January 1999, we completed the
   sale of our PCS Health Systems business, which provided pharmacy benefit
   management services in the United States.

Financial
   Information Relating to Business Segments and Classes of
   Products

You can find financial information
   relating to our business segments and classes of products in our 1999 Annual
   Report at pages 27-28 under “Segment Information” (pages 15-16 of
   Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K). That information is incorporated into this
   Report by reference.

The relative contribution of any
   particular product to our consolidated net sales changes from year to year.
   In addition, the contribution of any particular product to net income is not
   necessarily the same as its contribution to consolidated net sales. This is
   due to several factors, including the introduction of new products by us and
   by other manufacturers.

Products and
   Services

Marketing

We sell most of our products
   worldwide. We adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various
   countries to meet local needs.

Pharmaceuticals
     —United States

In the United States, we
   distribute pharmaceutical products principally through approximately 200
   independent wholesale distributing outlets. Our marketing policy is designed
   to assure that products are immediately available to physicians, pharmacies,
   hospitals, and appropriate health care professionals throughout the country.
   Three wholesale distributors in the United States accounted for
   approximately 18%, 15%, and 13%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales
   in 1999. No other distributor accounted for more than 10% of consolidated
   net sales. We also sell pharmaceutical products directly to the United
   States government and other manufacturers, but those direct sales are not
   material to consolidated net sales.

Salaried sales representatives
   promote our major pharmaceutical products in the United States under the
   Lilly and Dista trade names. These sales representatives call upon
   physicians, wholesalers, hospitals, managed-care organizations, retail
   pharmacists, and other health care professionals. To support our sales
   representatives’ efforts, we advertise in medical and drug journals,
   distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians, and
   exhibit at medical meetings. In addition, we advertise certain products
   directly to consumers in the United States. Divisions of our sales force are
   dedicated to product lines or practice areas, such as primary care,
   neuroscience, diabetes care, cardiovascular, endocrinology, and oncology. We
   have entered into licensing arrangements under which other companies market
   certain products manufactured by the Company, such as Ceclor CD, Dynabac,
   Keftab, and Permax. Most recently, in September 1999 we sold the rights to
   market Lorabid in the United States and Puerto Rico to King Pharmaceuticals,
   Inc.

Large purchasers of
   pharmaceuticals, such as managed-care groups and government and long-term
   care institutions, now account for a significant portion of total
   pharmaceutical purchases in the United States. We have created special sales
   groups to service managed-care organizations, government and long-term care
   institutions,
 hospital contract administrators, and certain retail pharmacies. In response
   to competitive pressures, we have entered into arrangements with a number of
   these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more
   Company products or other cost-sharing arrangements.

Pharmaceuticals
     —Outside the United States

Outside the United States, we
   promote our pharmaceutical products primarily through salaried sales
   representatives. While the products marketed vary from country to country,
   neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total sales.
   Distribution patterns vary from country to country. In most countries, we
   maintain our own sales and distribution organizations. In some countries,
   however, we market our products through joint ventures or independent
   distributors.

Animal Health
     Products

Our Elanco Animal Health business
   unit employs field salespeople throughout the United States to market animal
   health products. Elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the United
   States to market its animal health products. Elanco sells its products
   primarily to wholesale distributors.

Raw
   Materials

Most of the principal materials we
   use in our manufacturing operations are chemical, plant, and animal products
   that are available from more than one source. We obtain certain raw
   materials principally from only one source. If we were unable to obtain
   certain materials from present sources, we could experience an interruption
   in production until we established new sources or, in some cases,
   implemented alternative processes.

The major portion of our sales
   abroad are of products manufactured wholly or in part abroad. However, a
   principal source of active ingredients for those manufactured products
   continues to be our facilities in the United States.

Patents,
   Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights

Intellectual property protection
   is, in the aggregate, material to our ability to successfully commercialize
   our life sciences innovations. We own, have applied for, or are licensed
   under, a substantial number of patents, both in the United States and in
   other countries, relating to products, product uses, formulations, and
   manufacturing processes. There is no assurance that the patents we are
   seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been granted would be
   found valid if challenged. Moreover, patents relating to particular
   products, uses, formulations, or processes do not preclude other
   manufacturers from employing alternative processes or from successfully
   marketing alternative products that might successfully compete with our
   patented products.

Outside the United States, the
   standard of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies
   widely. While many countries have reasonably strong patent laws, other
   countries provide little or no effective protection for inventions or other
   intellectual property rights. In recent years, intellectual property
   protection has been strengthened in some countries because of the adoption
   of international agreements such as the new World Trade Agreement, and we
   believe further improvements are possible. It is too soon to assess how much
   we will benefit commercially from these changes.

When a product patent expires, the
   patent holder often loses effective market exclusivity for the product. This
   can result in very substantial reductions in sales of the patented product,
   particularly in the United States. However, in some cases the innovator
   company can obtain additional commercial benefits through manufacturing
   trade secrets; later-expiring patents on processes, uses, or formulations;
   trademark use; or marketing exclusivity that may be available under
   pharmaceutical regulatory laws.

We consider patent protection for
   certain products, processes, and uses—particularly that relating to
   Prozac, Zyprexa, Axid, Humalog, ReoPro, Gemzar, and Evista—to be
   important to our operations.

The United States compound
   patent covering Prozac expires in February 2001 and a patent for the method
   of use of the compound expires in December 2003.

See

“Legal
   Proceedings” at page 10 for a discussion of certain litigation
   involving those two patents. We are also eligible to receive an additional
   six months of marketing exclusivity for Prozac in the U.S. under the terms
   of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (“FDAMA
   ”). Under this law we are conducting clinical studies of Prozac in
   pediatric populations under a written request of the FDA. To obtain
   exclusivity, we must submit a report on these studies and the FDA must
   determine that the studies have been conducted in accordance with the
   written request, commonly accepted scientific principles and protocols, and
   the requirements of FDAMA. Outside the United States, Prozac patents
   generally either have expired or will expire over the next several
   years.

Other U.S. compound patent
   expirations include Axid, 2002; Zyprexa, 2011; Humalog, 2013; and ReoPro,
   2015. The Gemzar compound patent in the U.S. expires in 2010, but a use
   patent covering treatment of neoplasms with Gemzar is in force until 2012.
   We hold a number of U.S. patents covering Evista and its approved uses in
   osteoporosis prevention and treatment that we believe can provide us
   exclusivity in the United States until at least 2012.

Worldwide, we sell all of our
   major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be
   important to our operations. Trademark protection varies throughout the
   world, with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is
   used, and in other countries as long as it is registered. Registrations are
   normally for fixed but renewable terms.

We also grant licenses under our
   patents, trademarks, and know-how, and we manufacture and sell products and
   use technology and know-how under licenses from others. The amount of
   royalties paid and received were not material.

Competition

Our pharmaceutical products
   compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly
   competitive markets throughout the world. Our animal health products compete
   on a worldwide basis with products of pharmaceutical, chemical, and other
   companies that operate animal health divisions or subsidiaries.

Important competitive factors
   include product efficacy, safety and ease of use, price and demonstrated
   cost-effectiveness, service, and research and development of new products
   and processes. If competitors introduce new products and processes with
   therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive
   price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. When we introduce
   new products with patent protection, they usually must compete with other
   products already on the market at the time or products that are later
   developed by competitors. Manufacturers of generic products typically invest
   far less in research and development than research-based pharmaceutical
   companies; accordingly, they are able to price their products significantly
   lower than branded products. Therefore, when a branded product loses its
   market exclusivity, it often faces intense price competition from generic
   forms of the product. In many countries outside the United States, patent
   protection is weak or nonexistent. In order for us to successfully compete
   for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management
   organizations, we must demonstrate that our products offer not only medical
   benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of
   care.

We believe our long-term
   competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing
   innovative products that serve unmet medical needs and are cost-effective,
   together with our ability to manufacture the products efficiently and to
   effectively market them in a highly competitive environment. There can be no
   assurance that our research and development efforts will result in
   commercially successful products or that our products or processes will not
   become outmoded from time to time as a result of products or processes
   developed by our competitors.

Government
   Regulation

For many years our operations have
   been regulated extensively by the federal government, to some extent by
   state governments, and in varying degrees by foreign governments. The
   Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, other federal statutes and
   regulations, various state statutes and regulations, and laws and
   regulations of
 foreign governments govern to varying degrees the testing, approval,
   production, labeling, distribution, post-market surveillance, advertising,
   dissemination of information, and promotion of our products. The lengthy
   process of laboratory and clinical testing, data analysis, and regulatory
   review necessary for required governmental approvals is extremely costly and
   can significantly delay product introductions in a given market. Promotion,
   marketing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively
   regulated in all major world markets. In addition, our operations are
   subject to complex federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and
   occupational safety laws and regulations. We anticipate that the laws and
   regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the
   introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific
   and technical effort, time, and expense and significant capital
   investment.

In the United States, the Omnibus
   Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 requires us to provide rebates to state
   governments on their purchases of certain of our products under state
   Medicaid programs.

Other cost containment measures have been adopted
   or proposed by federal, state, and local government entities that provide or
   pay for health care. In most international markets, we operate in an
   environment of government-mandated cost containment programs, which may
   include price controls, discounts and rebates, restrictions on physician
   prescription levels, restrictions on reimbursement, compulsory licenses and
   generic substitution.

We expect that governments inside
   and outside the United States will continue to propose and/or adopt a
   variety of measures to contain health care costs, including pharmaceutical
   costs. Some of these measures could adversely affect our business. As an
   example, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States at
   both the state and federal levels intended to provide greater access to
   drugs for elderly and low-income Americans. Some of these proposals would,
   directly or indirectly, impose governmental controls on the prices at which
   our products are sold. Outside the United States, some proposals would
   either directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the
   value of our intellectual property protection. We cannot predict whether
   such proposals will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be
   affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory
   developments.

Research and
   Development

Our commitment to research and
   development dates back more than 100 years. Our research and development
   activities are responsible for the discovery or development of most of the
   products we offer today. We invest heavily in research and development,
   which we believe is critical to our long-term competitiveness. At the end of
   1999, we employed approximately 6,050 people, including a substantial number
   who are physicians or scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees or
   highly skilled technical personnel, in pharmaceutical and animal health
   research and development activities. We expended $1.37 billion on research
   and development activities in 1997, $1.74 billion in 1998, and $1.78 billion
   in 1999.

Our research is concerned
   primarily with the effects of synthetic chemicals and natural products on
   biological systems. We apply the results of that research to develop
   products to treat diseases in humans and animals, with the primary effort
   devoted to human pharmaceutical products. We concentrate our pharmaceutical
   research and development efforts in five therapeutic categories: central
   nervous system and related diseases; endocrine diseases, including diabetes
   and osteoporosis; infectious diseases; cancer; and cardiovascular diseases.
   However, we remain opportunistic; therefore, we selectively pursue promising
   leads in other therapeutic areas. We are actively engaged in biotechnology
   research programs involving recombinant DNA, proteins, and genomics (the
   development of therapeutics through identification of disease-causing genes
   and their cellular function). In addition to discovering and developing new
   chemical entities, we seek to expand the value of existing products through
   new uses and formulations.

To supplement our internal
   efforts, we sponsor and fund research and development by independent
   organizations, including educational institutions and research-based
   pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and we contract with others for
   the performance of research in their facilities. We use the services of
 physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and other research organizations
   worldwide to establish through clinical evidence the safety and
   effectiveness of new products. We actively seek out investments in external
   research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen
   our own research efforts. These investments can take many forms, including
   licensing arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, joint
   ventures, and acquisitions.

We also conduct extensive work in
   the animal sciences, including animal nutrition and physiology and
   veterinary medicine. Certain of our research and development activities
   relating to pharmaceutical products may be applicable to animal health
   products. An example is the search for agents that will cure infectious
   disease.

Drug development is
   time-consuming, expensive, and unpredictable. On average, only one out of
   many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be
   both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine. The
   process from discovery to regulatory approval can take more than ten years.
   Candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even late-stage product
   candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval. We believe our
   investments in research, both internally and in collaboration with others,
   have been rewarded by the number of new pharmaceutical compounds and
   indications in all stages of development. Among our new investigational
   compounds in the later stages of development are potential therapies for
   depression, various cancers, diabetic complications, osteoporosis,
   infectious diseases, sepsis, stroke, male erectile dysfunction, and
   attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Further, we are studying many
   other compounds in the earlier stages of development. We are also developing
   new uses and formulations for many of our important products, such as
   Prozac, Zyprexa, Gemzar, ReoPro, Humalog, and Evista.

Quality
   Assurance

Our success depends in great
   measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the
   integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness. The
   quality of our products arises from the total commitment to quality in all
   parts of our operations, including research and development, purchasing,
   facilities planning, manufacturing, and distribution. We have developed
   quality-assurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of
   scientific information and production processes.

Control of production processes
   involves rigid specifications for ingredients, equipment, facilities,
   manufacturing methods, packaging materials, and labeling. We perform tests
   at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure
   that the product meets all regulatory requirements and our standards. These
   tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses, microbiological
   testing, testing in animals, or a combination. Additional assurance of
   quality is provided by a corporate quality-assurance group that monitors
   existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and
   systems in the parent company, subsidiaries, and affiliates.

Executive Officers
   of the Company

The following table sets forth
   certain information regarding our executive officers. All but one of the
   executive officers have been employed by the Company in executive or
   managerial positions during the last five years. Charles E. Golden joined
   the Company as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and was
   elected to the Board of Directors in March 1996. He previously had held a
   number of executive positions with General Motors Corporation (“GM
   ”) including Vice President of GM and Chairman and Managing Director of
   Vauxhall Motors Limited, a GM subsidiary in the United Kingdom, from 1993 to
   1996, Vice President and Treasurer from 1992 to 1993, and Treasurer from
   1989 to 1992.

The term of office for each
   executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the Board of
   Directors, to be held on April 17, 2000, or on the date his or her successor
   is chosen and qualified. No director or executive officer of the Company has
   a “family relationship” with any other director or executive
   officer of
 the Company, as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure
   requirement. There is no understanding between any executive officer of the
   Company and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was
   selected.

Employees

At the end of 1999,
          we employed approximately 31,300 people, including approximately
          15,800 employees outside the United States. A substantial number of
          our employees have long records of continuous service.

Financial
          Information Relating to Foreign and Domestic
          Operations

You can find
          financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations in
          the Company’s 1999 Annual Report at pages 27-28 under
          “Segment Information” (pages 15-16 of Exhibit 13). That
          information is incorporated in the Report by reference.

To date, our overall
          operations abroad have not been significantly deterred by local
          restrictions on the transfer of funds from branches and subsidiaries
          located abroad, including the availability of dollar exchange. We
          cannot predict what effect these restrictions or the other risks
          inherent in foreign operations, including possible nationalization,
          might have on our future operations or what other restrictions may be
          imposed in the future. In addition, changing currency values can
          either favorably or unfavorably affect our financial position and
          results of operations. We actively manage foreign exchange risk
          through various hedging techniques including the use of foreign
          currency contracts.

Item 2.
          Properties

Our principal
          domestic and international executive offices are located in
          Indianapolis. At December 31, 1999, we owned 12 production and
          distribution facilities in the United States and Puerto Rico.
          Together with the corporate administrative offices, these facilities
          contain an aggregate of approximately 9.6 million square feet of
          floor area dedicated to production, distribution, and administration.
          Major production sites include Indianapolis; Clinton and Lafayette,
          Indiana; and Carolina and Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. We also lease sales
          offices in a number of cities located in the United States and
          abroad.

We own production and
          distribution facilities in 18 countries outside the United States and
          Puerto Rico, containing an aggregate of approximately 4.4 million
          square feet of floor space. Major production sites include facilities
          in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Ireland, Brazil, Mexico, and
          Italy. We lease production and warehouse facilities in Puerto Rico
          and 18 countries outside the United States.

Our research and
          development facilities in the United States consist of approximately
          4.0 million square feet and are located primarily in Indianapolis and
          Greenfield, Indiana. Our major research and development facilities
          abroad are located in Belgium, Germany, and the United Kingdom and
          contain approximately 525,000 square feet.

We believe that none
          of our properties is subject to any encumbrance, easement, or other
          restriction that would detract materially from its value or impair
          its use in the operation of the business. The buildings we own are of
          varying ages and in good condition.

Item 3.
          Legal Proceedings

Prozac Patent
          Litigation.

In March 1996 we were informed by Barr Laboratories,
          Inc. (“Barr”), a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer, that
          it had submitted an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA
          ”) to the U.S. FDA seeking to market a generic form of Prozac in
          the United States several years before the expiration of our patents.
          Barr has alleged that our U.S. patents covering Prozac are invalid
          and unenforceable. The compound patent expires in February 2001 and a
          patent for the method of use of the compound expires in December
          2003. These patents are material to the Company.

On April 11, 1996, we
          filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern
          District of Indiana seeking a ruling that Barr’s challenge to
          our patents is without merit. In 1997, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (
          “Geneva”), another generic manufacturer, submitted a
          similar ANDA and, like Barr, asserted that our U.S. Prozac patents
          are invalid and unenforceable. On June 23, 1997, we sued Geneva in
          the same court seeking a similar ruling as in the Barr suit. The two
          suits were consolidated. On January 12, 1999, the trial court judge
          for the Southern District of Indiana granted partial summary judgment
          in our favor, dismissing the claims of Barr and Geneva based on the
          patent doctrines of “best mode” and “double patenting.
          ” On January 25, 1999 (the day trial was to have begun), Barr
          and Geneva agreed to abandon their remaining two claims (based on the
          patent doctrines of “anticipation” and “inequitable
          conduct”) in exchange for a payment of $4 million to be shared
          among Barr, Geneva, and a third defendant, Apotex, Inc. Barr, Geneva,
          and Apotex appealed the trial court’s January 12, 1999 rulings
          to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Court of Appeals
          held oral arguments on the appeal on March 8, 2000.

In late 1998, three
          additional generic manufacturers, Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals,
          Inc., Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, and Cheminor Drugs, Ltd. together
          with one of its subsidiaries filed ANDAs for generic forms of Prozac,
          asserting that our December 2003 patent is invalid and unenforceable.
          Finally, in January 1999, Novex Pharma, a division of Apotex, Inc.
          filed an ANDA asserting that both the 2001 and 2003 patents are
          invalid and unenforceable. We filed lawsuits in the United States
          District Court of the Southern District of Indiana seeking rulings
          that the four companies’ challenges to the patent(s) are without
          merit. In November 1999, we filed a lawsuit in federal court in
          Indiana against Cheminor Drugs and Schein Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
          based on their ANDA filing for an additional dosage form. A trial
          date of October 30, 2000, has been set for the cases involving
          Zenith, Teva, Cheminor, and Schein.

We believe that the
          claims of the seven generic manufacturers are without merit and that
          we should be successful in this litigation. However, it is not
          possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and
          accordingly there can be no assurance that we will prevail. An
          unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our
          consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of
          operations.

Product Liability
          Litigation.

We are currently a defendant in a variety of product
          liability litigation lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (
          “DES”) and Prozac. In approximately 85 actions, including
          several with multiple claimants, plaintiffs seek to recover damages
          on behalf of children or grandchildren of women who ingested DES
          during pregnancy. In another approximately ten actions, plaintiffs
          seek to recover damages as a result of the ingestion of
          Prozac.

Pricing
          Litigation.

We have been named, together with numerous other U.S.
          prescription pharmaceutical manufacturers and in some cases
          wholesalers or distributors, as a defendant in a large number of
          related actions brought by retail pharmacies and consumers of
          prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States alleging violations
          of federal or state antitrust laws, or both, based on the practice of
          providing discounts or rebates to managed-care organizations and
          certain other purchasers. The federal cases have been consolidated or
          coordinated in the Northern District of Illinois as

In re Brand
          Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation

(MDL No.
          997).

The federal suits
          include a certified class action on behalf of a majority of retail
          pharmacies in the United States (the “Federal Class Action
          ”). The class plaintiffs allege an industrywide agreement in
          violation of the Sherman Act to deny favorable pricing on sales of
          brand-name prescription pharmaceuticals to certain retail pharmacies
          in the United States. The other federal suits (the “Federal
          Individual Actions”), brought as individual claims by several
          thousand pharmacies, allege price discrimination in violation of the
          Robinson-Patman Act as well as Sherman Act claims. The suits seek
          treble damages and injunctive relief against allegedly discriminatory
          pricing practices.

In 1995, we and
          several other manufacturers agreed with the plaintiffs to settle the
          Federal Class Action. In addition, in 1997 and 1998 we reached
          settlements with two large groups of retail pharmacy and supermarket
          chains that were plaintiffs in the Federal Individual Actions. More
          recently, we have reached an agreement in principle to settle with
          approximately 3,800 of the Federal Individual Action plaintiffs. As a
          result of the various settlements, we have disposed of the claims of
          all but a few hundred of the U.S. retailers. With respect to the
          remaining Federal Individual Actions, the District Court has
          designated certain plaintiffs and defendants named in the individual
          suits (not including the Company) to participate in an initial trial
          or trials of the claims. No trial dates have been set.
          Robinson-Patman claims asserted in the Federal Individual Actions
          against nondesignated defendants, including the Company, are
          stayed.

In addition, a number
          of related state court cases were filed. The state court suits
          typically seek money damages and injunctive relief against allegedly
          discriminatory pricing practices. Cases were brought in Alabama,
          California, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Wisconsin by retail
          pharmacies alleging violations of various state antitrust and pricing
          laws, purporting to be class actions on behalf of all retail
          pharmacies in those states. Settlements have been approved in
          Minnesota and Wisconsin and the cases in those states are now
          dismissed. Cases were also brought in state courts in Alabama,
          Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Maine,
          Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North
          Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wisconsin that
          purport to be class actions on behalf of consumers of prescription
          pharmaceuticals, alleging violations of state antitrust, pricing or
          consumer protection laws. Settlements have been approved and the
          cases dismissed in all states except Alabama, New Mexico, North
          Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, and West Virginia.

Other
          Matters.

In March 1996, the Federal Trade
          Commission (“FTC”) commenced a non-public investigation
          focusing on the pricing practices described under “Pricing
          Litigation” above. We have responded to two subpoenas from the
          FTC requesting production of certain documents and other discovery
          responses. We believe that all of our actions have been lawful and
          proper and are cooperating with the investigation.

We are also a
          defendant in other litigation, including product liability and patent
          suits, of a character regarded as normal to our business.

While it is not
          possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal actions and
          investigations pending against us, we believe that except as noted
          above, the costs associated with all such matters will not have a
          material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or
          liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results
          of operations in any one accounting period.
