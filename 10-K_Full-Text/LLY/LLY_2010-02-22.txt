Part I

Item 1.

Business

Eli Lilly and Company (the “Company” or
    “Registrant”) was incorporated in 1901 in Indiana to
    succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in
    Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. We
    discover, develop, manufacture, and sell products in one
    significant business segment—pharmaceutical products. We
    also have an animal health business segment, whose operations
    are not material to our financial statements.

Our mission is to make medicines that help people live longer,
    healthier, more active lives. Our strategy is to create value
    for all our stakeholders by accelerating the flow of innovative
    new medicines that provide improved outcomes for individual
    patients. Most of the products we sell today were discovered or
    developed by our own scientists, and our success depends to a
    great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop,
    and bring to market innovative new medicines.

We manufacture and distribute our products through facilities in
    the United States, Puerto Rico, and 17 other countries. Our
    products are sold in approximately 128 countries.

Marketing

We sell most of our products worldwide. We adapt our marketing
    methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local
    needs.

Pharmaceuticals—United
    States

In the United States, we distribute pharmaceutical products
    principally through independent wholesale distributors, with
    some sales directly to pharmacies. Our marketing policy is
    designed to assure that products and relevant medical
    information are immediately available to physicians, pharmacies,
    hospitals, public and private payers, and appropriate health
    care professionals. Three wholesale distributors in the United
    States—AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation,
    and Cardinal Health, Inc.—each accounted for between 12
    percent and 17 percent of our worldwide consolidated net
    sales in 2009. No other distributor accounted for more than
    10 percent of consolidated net sales. We also sell
    pharmaceutical products directly to the United States government
    and other manufacturers, but those sales are not material.

We promote our major pharmaceutical products in the United
    States through sales representatives who call upon physicians
    and other health care professionals. We advertise in medical
    journals, distribute literature and samples of certain products
    to physicians, and exhibit at medical meetings. In addition, we
    advertise certain products directly to consumers in the United
    States and we maintain web sites with information about all our
    major products. Divisions of our sales force are assigned to
    therapeutic areas, such as neuroscience, diabetes, osteoporosis,
    and oncology. We supplement our employee sales force with
    contract sales organizations as appropriate to leverage our own
    resources and the strengths of our partners in various markets.

Large purchasers of pharmaceuticals, such as managed-care
    groups, government agencies, and long-term care institutions,
    account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical
    purchases in the United States. We maintain special business
    groups to service wholesalers, managed-care organizations,
    government and long-term care institutions, hospitals, and
    certain retail pharmacies. In response to competitive pressures,
    we have entered into arrangements with these organizations which
    provide for discounts or rebates on one or more Lilly products.

Pharmaceuticals—Outside
    the United States

Outside the United States, we promote our pharmaceutical
    products primarily through sales representatives. While the
    products marketed vary from country to country, neuroscience
    products constitute the largest single group in total sales.
    Distribution patterns vary from country to country. In most
    countries,


we maintain our own sales organizations, but in some countries
    we market our products through independent distributors.

Pharmaceutical
    Marketing Collaborations

We market certain of our significant products in collaboration
    with other pharmaceutical companies:

•

Under an arrangement that ended in 2009, Cymbalta was
    co-promoted in the United States by Quintiles Transnational
    Corp. Cymbalta is co-marketed in Japan by Shionogi &
    Co. Ltd. and is co-promoted or co-marketed in most other major
    countries outside the U.S. by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH.

•

Evista is marketed in major European markets by Daiichi Sankyo
    Europe GmbH, a subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. of Japan.

•

We co-promote Byetta with Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the
    United States and Puerto Rico, and we have exclusive marketing
    rights in other territories.

•

Erbitux is marketed in North America by Bristol-Myers Squibb. We
    co-promote Erbitux in North America. Outside North America,
    Erbitux is commercialized by Merck KGaA. We receive royalties
    from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck KGaA.

•

Effient is co-promoted with us by Daiichi Sankyo in the United
    States, major European markets, Brazil, Mexico, China, and
    several other Asian countries. Daiichi Sanko retains sole
    marketing rights in Japan, and we retain sole marketing rights
    in Canada, Australia, Russia, and certain other countries.

Animal Health
    Products

Our Elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople
    throughout the United States. Elanco also has an extensive sales
    force outside the United States. Elanco sells its products
    primarily to wholesale distributors.

Competition

Our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured
    by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout
    the world. Our animal health products compete on a worldwide
    basis with products of animal health care companies as well as
    pharmaceutical, chemical, and other companies that operate
    animal health divisions or subsidiaries.

Important competitive factors include safety, effectiveness, and
    ease of use of our products; price and demonstrated
    cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; and research and
    development of new products and processes. Most new products
    that we introduce must compete with other products already on
    the market or products that are later developed by competitors.
    If competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with
    therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to
    progressive price reductions, decreased volume of sales, or
    both. Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals invest far less
    in research and development than research-based pharmaceutical
    companies and therefore can price their products much lower than
    branded products. Accordingly, when a branded pharmaceutical
    loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price
    competition from generic forms of the product. In many countries
    outside the United States, intellectual property protection is
    weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic or
    counterfeit versions of our products. Increasingly, to obtain
    favorable reimbursement and formulary positioning with
    government payers, managed care and pharmacy benefits management
    organizations, we must demonstrate that our products offer not
    only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with
    other forms of care.

We believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our
    success in discovering and developing (either alone or in
    collaboration with others) innovative, cost-effective medicines
    that provide improved outcomes to individual patients and
    deliver value to payers, together with our ability to
    continuously improve the productivity of our discovery,
    development, manufacturing, marketing, and support operations in
    a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance that
    our research and development efforts will result in commercially
    successful products or that our products or processes will not
    become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products
    or processes developed by our competitors.

Patents,
    Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights

Overview

Intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to
    successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and
    invest in the search for new medicines. We own, have applied
    for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents in the
    United States and many other countries relating to products,
    product uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. There
    is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted
    or that the patents we hold would be found valid and enforceable
    if challenged. Moreover, patents relating to particular
    products, uses, formulations, or processes do not preclude other
    manufacturers


from employing alternative processes or from marketing
    alternative products or formulations that might successfully
    compete with our patented products. In addition, from time to
    time, competitors or other third parties assert claims that our
    activities infringe patents or other intellectual property
    rights held by them, or allege a third-party right of ownership
    in our existing intellectual property.

Outside the United States, the adequacy and effectiveness of
    intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies
    widely. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
    Agreement (TRIPs) administered by the World Trade Organization
    (WTO), over 140 countries have now agreed to provide
    non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions
    and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available
    to all patent owners. Because of TRIPs transition provisions,
    dispute resolution mechanisms, and substantive limitations, it
    is difficult to assess when and how much, if at all, we will
    benefit commercially from this protection.

When a product patent expires, the patent holder often loses
    effective market exclusivity for the product. This can result in
    a severe and rapid decline in sales of the formerly patented
    product, particularly in the United States. However, in some
    cases the innovator company may achieve exclusivity beyond the
    expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade
    secrets, later-expiring patents on methods of use or
    formulations, or data-based exclusivity that may be available
    under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.

Some of our current products, including Erbitux, Forteo, ReoPro,
    and Xigris, and many of the potential products in our research
    pipeline, are biological products (“biologics”).
    Currently, generic versions of biologics cannot be approved
    under U.S. law. Competitors seeking approval of biologics
    must file their own safety and efficacy data, and address the
    challenges of biologics manufacturing, which typically involves
    more complex and costly processes than those of traditional
    pharmaceutical operations. However, certain health care reform
    bills recently debated in Congress included provisions that
    would create a regulatory pathway to allow generic biologics.
    Under these proposals, the innovator would receive data-based
    exclusivity for a period of years following regulatory approval
    for marketing. Even in the absence of new legislation, the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is taking steps
    toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics.

Our Intellectual
    Property Portfolio

We consider intellectual property protection for certain
    products, processes, and uses—particularly those products
    discussed below—to be important to our operations. For many
    of our products, in addition to the compound patent we hold
    other patents on manufacturing processes, formulations, or uses
    that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product
    patent.

The most relevant U.S. patent protection, together with
    expected expiration, for our major marketed products is as
    follows:

•

Alimta

is protected by a compound patent (2016).

•

Byetta

is protected by a patent covering its use in
    treating type 2 diabetes (2017).

•

Cialis

is protected by compound and use patents (2017).

•

Cymbalta

is protected by a compound patent (2013).

•

Effient

is protected by a compound patent (2017).

•

Evista

is protected by patents on the treatment and
    prevention of osteoporosis (2012 and 2014), and its dosage form
    (2017)


.

    Evista for use in breast cancer risk reduction is protected by
    orphan drug exclusivity (2014).

•

Gemzar

is protected by a compound patent (November
    2010) and a patent covering its antineoplastic use
    (2013)


.

•

Humalog

is protected by a compound patent (2013).

•

Strattera

is protected by a patent covering its use in
    treating attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (2016).

•

Zyprexa

is protected by a compound patent (October 2011).


The Evista dosage form patent and Gemzar use patent have been
    held invalid by federal district courts, and we have appealed
    those decisions. For more information, see Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Legal and
    Regulatory Matters.”

Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks
    that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our
    operations. Trademark protection varies throughout the world,
    with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark
    is used, and in other countries as long as it is registered.
    Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms.


Patent
    Licenses

Most of our important products were discovered in our own
    laboratories and are not subject to significant license
    agreements. Two of our larger products, Cialis and Alimta, are
    subject to patent assignments or licenses granted to us by
    others.

•

The compound patent for Cialis is the subject of a license
    agreement with Glaxo SmithKline which assigns to us exclusively
    all rights in the compound. The agreement calls for royalties of
    a single-digit percentage of net sales. The agreement is not
    subject to termination by Glaxo for any reason other than a
    material breach by Lilly of the royalty obligation, after a
    substantial cure period.

•

The compound patent for Alimta is the subject of a license
    agreement with Princeton University, granting us an irrevocable
    exclusive worldwide license to the compound patents for the
    lives of the patents in the respective territories. The
    agreement calls for royalties of a single-digit percentage of
    net sales. The agreement is not subject to termination by
    Princeton for any reason other than a material breach by Lilly
    of the royalty obligation, after a substantial cure period.
    Alimta is also the subject of a worldwide, nonexclusive license
    to certain compound and process patents owned by Takeda
    Pharmaceutical Company Limited. The agreement calls for
    royalties of a single-digit percentage of net sales in countries
    covered by a relevant patent. The agreement is subject to
    termination for material default and failure to cure by Lilly
    and in the event that Lilly becomes bankrupt or insolvent.

Patent
    Challenges

In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term
    Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as
    “Hatch-Waxman,” made a complex set of changes to both
    patent and new-drug-approval laws. Before Hatch-Waxman, no drug
    could be approved without providing the FDA complete safety and
    efficacy studies,

i.e.

, a complete New Drug Application
    (NDA). Hatch-Waxman authorizes the FDA to approve generic
    versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than biologics)
    without such information by filing an Abbreviated New Drug
    Application (ANDA). In an ANDA, the generic manufacturer must
    demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic
    version and the NDA-approved drug—not safety and efficacy.

Absent a patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until
    after the innovator’s patents expire. However, after the
    innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic
    manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that one or more of the
    patents listed in the innovator’s NDA are invalid or not
    infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a
    “Paragraph IV certification.” The innovator must
    then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its
    patents. The FDA is then prohibited from approving the generic
    company’s application for a 30- to

42-month

period (which can be shortened or extended by the trial court
    judge hearing the patent challenge). If one or more of the
    NDA-listed patents are challenged, the first filer of a
    Paragraph IV certification may be entitled to a

180-day

period of market exclusivity over all other generic
    manufacturers.

In recent years, generic manufacturers have used
    Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge
    patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals, and we
    expect this trend to continue. In addition, generic companies
    have shown an increasing willingness to launch “at
    risk,” i.e., after receiving ANDA approval but before final
    resolution of their patent challenge. We are currently in
    litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from
    their Paragraph IV certifications on Alimta, Cymbalta,
    Evista, Gemzar, and Strattera. For more information on this
    litigation, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis—Legal and Regulatory Matters.”

Outside the United States, the legal doctrines and processes by
    which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely. In
    recent years, we have experienced an increase in patent
    challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside
    the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. For
    more information on significant patent challenges outside the
    United States, see Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis—Legal and Regulatory Matters.”

Government
    Regulation

Regulation of Our
    Operations

Our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national,
    state, and local agencies. The lengthy process of laboratory and
    clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing development, and
    regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is
    extremely costly and can significantly delay product
    introductions. Promotion, marketing, manufacturing, and
    distribution of pharmaceutical and animal health products are
    extensively regulated in all major world markets. We are
    required to conduct extensive post-marketing surveillance of the
    safety of the products we sell. In addition, our operations are
    subject to complex federal, state, local, and foreign laws and
    regulations concerning the environment, occupational health and
    safety, and privacy. The laws and regulations affecting the
    manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery,
    development, and introduction of new products will continue to
    require substantial scientific and technical effort, time, and
    expense and significant capital investment.


Of particular importance is the FDA in the United States.
    Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA
    has jurisdiction over all of our products and administers
    requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness,
    manufacturing, quality control, distribution, labeling,
    marketing, advertising, dissemination of information, and
    post-marketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products. The
    FDA, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),
    also regulates our animal health products. The
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also regulates some
    animal health products. In 2007, Congress passed the Food and
    Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA), which imposes
    additional requirements for drug development and
    commercialization and provides the FDA with further authorities
    and resources, particularly in the area of drug safety.

The FDA extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing
    quality under its current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)
    regulations. In recent years, we have made, and we continue to
    make, substantial investments of capital and operating expenses
    to implement comprehensive, company-wide improvements in our
    manufacturing, product and process development, and quality
    operations to ensure sustained cGMP compliance. However, in the
    event we fail to adhere to cGMP requirements in the future, we
    could be subject to interruptions in production, fines and
    penalties, and delays in new product approvals.

Outside the United States, our products and operations are
    subject to similar regulatory requirements, notably by the
    European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the European Union and the
    Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan. Specific
    regulatory requirements vary from country to country.

The marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of
    pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which
    manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers, are
    subject to various other federal and state laws, including the
    federal anti-kickback statute and the False Claims Act and state
    laws governing kickbacks, false claims, unfair trade practices,
    and consumer protection. These laws are administered by, among
    others, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector
    General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the
    Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Personnel Management and
    state attorneys general. Over the past several years, the FDA,
    the Department of Justice, and many of these other agencies have
    increased their enforcement activities with respect to
    pharmaceutical companies and increased the inter-agency
    coordination of enforcement activities. Over this period,
    several claims brought by these agencies against Lilly and other
    companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate
    criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements. See
    Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” and Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Legal and
    Regulatory Matters,” for information about currently
    pending and recently resolved marketing and promotional
    practices investigations involving Lilly, including information
    regarding a Corporate Integrity Agreement entered into by Lilly
    in connection with the resolution of a U.S. federal
    marketing practices investigation and certain related state
    investigations involving Zyprexa.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”)
    prohibits certain individuals and entities, including
    U.S. publicly traded companies, from promising, offering,
    or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the
    corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the
    purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain
    any improper advantage. The FCPA also imposes specific
    recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on
    U.S. publicly traded companies. As noted above, outside the
    U.S., our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves
    significant interaction with foreign officials. Additionally, in
    many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who
    prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the
    purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities;
    therefore, our payments to these prescribers and purchasers are
    subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the
    Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement
    activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. See
    Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” for information
    about a currently pending investigation involving our operations
    in several countries.

It is possible that we could become subject to additional
    administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could
    include claims for civil penalties (including treble damages
    under the False Claims Act), criminal sanctions, and
    administrative remedies, including exclusion from federal health
    care programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in pending
    or future actions could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial
    position.

Regulations
    Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement

In the United States, we are required to provide rebates to
    state governments on their purchases of certain of our products
    under state Medicaid programs. Additional cost containment
    measures have been adopted or proposed by federal, state, and
    local government entities that provide or pay for health care.
    In most international markets, we operate in an environment of
    government-mandated cost containment programs, which may include
    price controls, reference pricing, discounts and rebates,
    restrictions on physician prescription levels, restrictions on
    reimbursement, compulsory licenses, health economic assessments,
    and generic substitution.

In the U.S., the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
    Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) provides a prescription drug
    benefit for seniors under the Medicare program, known as
    Medicare Part D. Pricing to manufacturers for drugs covered
    by the program is currently established through competitive
    negotiations


between the manufacturers and private payers. In addition,
    comprehensive health care reform was the subject of recent
    intense debate in Congress, and we expect the health care reform
    debate to continue. Although it is difficult to predict the
    direction of the debate, the ultimate outcome could have a
    material adverse impact on our business. See Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Executive
    Overview—Legal, Regulatory, and Other Matters,” for
    more discussion of MMA and U.S. health care reform. At the
    state level, budget pressures are causing various states to
    impose cost-control measures such as higher rebates and more
    restrictive formularies.

International operations are also generally subject to extensive
    price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for
    additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that
    would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls,
    limit access to or reimbursement for our products, or reduce the
    value of our intellectual property protection.

We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be
    affected by these or other potential future legislative or
    regulatory developments. However, we expect that pressures on
    pharmaceutical pricing will become more severe.

Research
    and Development

Our commitment to research and development dates back more than
    100 years. Our research and development activities are
    responsible for the discovery and development of most of the
    products we offer today. We invest heavily in research and
    development because we believe it is critical to our long-term
    competitiveness. At the end of 2009, we employed approximately
    7,600 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research
    and development activities, including a substantial number of
    physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees,
    and highly skilled technical personnel. Our research and
    development expenses were $3.49 billion in 2007,
    $3.84 billion in 2008, and $4.33 billion in 2009.

Our pharmaceutical research and development focuses on four
    therapeutic categories: central nervous system and related
    diseases; endocrine diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and
    musculoskeletal disorders; cancer; and cardiovascular diseases.
    However, we remain opportunistic, selectively pursuing promising
    leads in other therapeutic areas. We are actively engaged in a
    strong biotechnology research program, including therapeutic
    proteins, antibodies, and antisense oligonucleotides as well as
    genomics (the development of therapeutics through identification
    of disease-causing genes and their cellular function),
    biomarkers, and targeted therapeutics. In addition to
    discovering and developing new chemical entities, we seek to
    expand the value of existing products through new uses,
    formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional
    value to patients. We also conduct research in animal health,
    including animal nutrition and physiology, control of parasites,
    and veterinary medicine (both food and companion animal).

To supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others,
    including educational institutions and research-based
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and we contract with
    others for the performance of research in their facilities. We
    use the services of physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and
    other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical
    trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our
    pharmaceutical products. We actively seek out investments in
    external research and technologies that hold the promise to
    complement and strengthen our own research efforts. These
    investments can take many forms, including licensing
    arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements,
    co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, and acquisitions.

Drug development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. On
    average, only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds
    discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective
    and safe enough to become an approved medicine. The process from
    discovery to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or
    longer. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process,
    and even late-stage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive
    regulatory approval or achieve commercial success. Even after
    approval and launch of a product, we expend considerable
    resources on post-marketing surveillance and clinical studies.
    We believe our investments in research, both internally and in
    collaboration with others, have been rewarded by the number of
    new compounds and new indications for existing compounds that we
    have in all stages of development. At present we have over 60
    drug candidates across all stages of human testing. Among our
    new investigational compounds in the later stages of human
    testing are potential therapies for diabetes, cancers, and
    Alzheimer’s disease. We are studying many other drug
    candidates in the earlier stages of development, including
    compounds targeting cancers, diabetes, schizophrenia, obesity,
    depression, sleep disorders, pain, alcohol dependence,
    musculoskeletal disorders, atherosclerosis, and autoimmune
    disorders including rheumatoid arthritis. We are also developing
    new uses, formulations, or delivery methods for many of these
    compounds as well as our currently marketed products, such as
    Alimta, Byetta, Cialis, Cymbalta, Effient, Erbitux, Forteo,
    Gemzar, and Humalog.

Raw
    Materials and Product Supply

Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing
    operations are available from more than one source. However, we
    obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source.
    In addition, Byetta is manufactured by third-party suppliers to
    Amylin. In the event one of these suppliers was unable to
    provide the materials or product, we generally have sufficient
    inventory to supply the market until an alternative


source of supply can be implemented. However, in the event of an
    extended failure of a supplier, it is possible that we could
    experience an interruption in supply until we established new
    sources or, in some cases, implemented alternative processes.

Our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at five sites in the
    United States as well as locations in Ireland, Puerto Rico, and
    the United Kingdom. Finishing operations, including labeling and
    packaging, take place at a number of sites throughout the world.
    Effective in January 2010, we sold one of our U.S. sites,
    Tippecanoe Laboratories in West Lafayette, Indiana, to an
    affiliate of Evonik Industries AG, and entered into a nine-year
    supply and services agreement whereby Evonik will manufacture
    final and intermediate step active pharmaceutical ingredients
    for certain Lilly human and animal health products.

We manage our supply chain (including our own facilities,
    contracted arrangements, and inventory) in a way that should
    allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining
    flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve
    efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. However,
    pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly
    regulated, and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or
    adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process
    requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory
    approvals. Accordingly, if we were to experience extended plant
    shutdowns at one of our own facilities, extended failure of a
    contract supplier, or extraordinary unplanned increases in
    demand, we could experience an interruption in supply of certain
    products or product shortages until production could be resumed
    or expanded.

Quality
    Assurance

Our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in
    the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data
    that support their safety and effectiveness. Product quality
    arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our
    operations, including research and development, purchasing,
    facilities planning, manufacturing, and distribution. We have
    implemented quality-assurance procedures relating to the quality
    and integrity of scientific information and production processes.

Control of production processes involves rigid specifications
    for ingredients, equipment, facilities, manufacturing methods,
    packaging materials, and labeling. We perform tests at various
    stages of production processes and on the final product to
    assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and
    our standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical
    chemical analyses, microbiological testing, testing in animals,
    or a combination. Additional assurance of quality is provided by
    a corporate quality-assurance group that monitors existing
    pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and
    systems in the parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates, and
    third-party suppliers.

Executive
    Officers of the Company

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our
    executive officers. Except as otherwise noted, all executive
    officers have been employed by the Company in executive
    positions during the last five years.

The term of office for each executive officer expires on the
    date of the annual meeting of the Board of Directors, to be held
    on April 19, 2010, or on the date his or her successor is
    chosen and qualified. No director or executive officer has a
    “family relationship” with any other director or
    executive officer of the Company, as that term is defined for
    purposes of this disclosure requirement. There is no
    understanding between any executive officer and any other person
    pursuant to which the executive officer was selected.

    number of our employees have long records of continuous service.

Financial
    Information Relating to Business Segments and Classes of
    Products

You can find financial information relating to our business
    segments and classes of products in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

“Segment Information.” That information is
    incorporated here by reference.

The relative contribution of any particular product to our
    consolidated net sales changes from year to year. This is due to
    several factors, including the introduction of new products by
    us and by other manufacturers and the introduction of generic
    pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations. In addition, margins
    vary for our different products due to various factors,
    including differences in the cost to manufacture and market the
    products, the value of the products to the marketplace, and
    government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement. Our major
    product sales are generally not seasonal.

Financial
    Information Relating to Foreign and Domestic
    Operations

You can find financial information relating to foreign and
    domestic operations in Item 8, “Segment
    Information.” That information is incorporated here by
    reference. To date, our overall operations abroad have not been
    significantly deterred by local restrictions on the transfer of
    funds from branches and subsidiaries located abroad, including
    the availability of U.S. dollar exchange. We cannot predict
    what effect these restrictions or the other risks inherent in
    foreign operations, including possible nationalization, might
    have on our future operations or what other restrictions may be
    imposed in the future. In addition, changing currency values can
    either favorably or unfavorably affect our financial position,


liquidity, and results of operations. We mitigate foreign
    exchange risk through various hedging techniques including the
    use of foreign currency contracts.

Available
    Information on Our Web Site

We make available through our company web site, free of charge,
    our company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (SEC) as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking
    Statements

In addition to the other information contained in this

Form 10-K,

the following risk factors should be considered carefully in
    evaluating our company. It is possible that our business,
    financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could
    be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.

We make certain forward-looking statements in this

Form 10-K,

and company spokespersons may make such statements in the
    future. Where possible, we try to identify forward-looking
    statements by using such words as “expect,”
    “plan,” “will,” “estimate,”
    “forecast,” “project,” “believe,”
    and “anticipate”. Forward-looking statements do not
    relate strictly to historical or current facts. They are likely
    to address our growth strategy, sales of current and anticipated
    products, financial results, our research and development
    programs, the status of product approvals, legislative and
    regulatory developments, and the outcome of contingencies such
    as litigation and investigations. All forward-looking statements
    are based on our expectations at the time we make them. They are
    subject to risks and uncertainties, including those summarized
    below.

•

Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and
    highly uncertain.

There are many difficulties and
    uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and
    development and the introduction of new products. There is a
    high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and
    development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market
    typically takes a decade or more and costs over $1 billion.
    Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in
    the process after substantial investment. As a result, most
    funds invested in research programs will not generate financial
    returns. New product candidates that appear promising in
    development may fail to reach the market or may have only
    limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety
    concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals,
    limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to
    manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual
    property rights of others. Delays and uncertainties in the FDA
    approval process and the approval processes in other countries
    can result in delays in product launches and lost market
    opportunity. In recent years, FDA review times have increased
    substantially and fewer new drugs are being approved. In
    addition, it can be very difficult to predict sales growth rates
    of new products.

•

We face intense competition.

We compete with a large
    number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology
    companies and generic pharmaceutical companies. To compete
    successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market
    innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical
    needs. Our product sales can be adversely affected by the
    introduction by competitors of branded products that are
    perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic versions of
    our branded products, and by generic versions of other products
    in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. See
    Item 1, “Business—Competition,” for more
    details.

•

We depend on patent-protected products for most of our
    revenues, cash flows, and earnings, and we will lose effective
    intellectual property protection for many of them in the next
    several years.

Eight significant products, which
    together comprise 74 percent of our worldwide revenue, will
    lose their


most significant remaining U.S. patent protection, as well
    as their intellectual property-based exclusivity in most
    countries outside the U.S., in the next several years:

The

    Gemzar use patent and Evista dosage form patent have been held
    invalid by federal district courts, and we have appealed those
    decisions. For more information, see Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Legal and
    Regulatory Matters.”

Loss of exclusivity typically results in a rapid and severe
    decline in sales. See Item 1, “Business—Patents,
    Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Protection,”
    for more details. Additionally, if these or other significant
    products were to become subject to a problem such as an early
    loss of patent protection as a result of litigation, unexpected
    side effects, regulatory proceedings, material product liability
    litigation, publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, or
    pressure from competitive products, the adverse impact on our
    revenues, cash flows, and earnings could be significant.

•

Our long-term success depends on intellectual property
    protection

.  Our long-term success depends on our
    ability to continually discover, develop, and commercialize
    innovative new pharmaceutical products. Without strong
    intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate
    the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in
    research and development and capital as well as other
    expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market.

Intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and
    is subject to change over time. In the U.S., the Hatch-Waxman
    Act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to
    invalidate our patents; as a result, we expect that our
    U.S. patents on major products will be routinely
    challenged, and there can be no assurance that our patents will
    be upheld. See Item 1, “Business—Patents,
    Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Protection,”
    for more details. We are increasingly facing generic
    manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as
    well. In addition, competitors or other third parties may claim
    that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual
    property rights held by them. If successful, such claims could
    result in our being unable to market a product in a particular
    territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement
    or royalties on future sales. See Item 1,
    “Business—Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual
    Property Protection,” for more details.

•

Our business is subject to increasing government price
    controls and other health care cost containment measures.

Government health care cost-containment measures can
    significantly affect our sales and profitability. In many
    countries outside the United States, government agencies
    strictly control, directly or indirectly, the prices at which
    our products are sold. In the United States, we are subject to
    substantial pricing pressures from state Medicaid programs and
    private insurance programs and pharmacy benefit managers,
    including those operating under the Medicare Part D
    pharmaceutical benefit. Many federal and state legislative
    proposals, including the comprehensive health care reform bills
    that were the subject of recent debate in Congress, would
    further negatively affect our pricing

and/or

reimbursement for our products. We expect pricing pressures from
    both governments and private payers inside and outside the
    United States to become more severe. See Item I,
    “Business—Regulations Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing
    and Reimbursement,” for more details.

•

Pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or
    efficacy concerns.

Unexpected safety or efficacy
    concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, leading to
    product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as
    costly product liability claims.

•

Regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the
    company.

The marketing, promotional, and pricing
    practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner
    in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers,
    and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. Many


companies, including Lilly, have been subject to claims related
    to these practices asserted by federal, state and foreign
    governmental authorities and private payers and consumers. These
    claims have resulted in substantial expense and other
    significant consequences to us. It is possible other products
    could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of
    these matters could include criminal charges and fines,
    penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. In
    particular, See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis—Legal and Regulatory Matters,” for the
    discussions of the U.S. sales and marketing practices
    investigations. In addition, regulatory issues concerning
    compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)
    regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product
    recalls and seizures, interruption of production leading to
    product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products
    pending resolution of the cGMP issues. We are now operating
    under a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of
    Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and
    Human Services that requires us to maintain comprehensive
    compliance programs governing our research, manufacturing, and
    sales and marketing of pharmaceuticals. A material failure to
    comply with the Agreement could result in severe sanctions to
    the company. See Item 1, “Business—Regulation of
    our Operations,” for more details.

•

We face many product liability claims today, and future
    claims will be largely self-insured.

We are
    subject to a substantial number of product liability claims
    involving primarily Zyprexa, diethylstilbestrol
    (“DES”), thimerosal, and Byetta, and because of the
    nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could
    become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for
    other products in the future. See Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Legal and
    Regulatory Matters,” and Item 3, “Legal
    Proceedings,” for more information on our current product
    liability litigation. Due to a very restrictive market for
    product liability insurance, we have been and will continue to
    be largely self-insured for future product liability losses for
    substantially all our currently marketed products. In addition,
    there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from
    our insurance carriers on past claims.

•

Manufacturing difficulties could lead to product supply
    problems.

Pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and
    highly regulated. Manufacturing difficulties at our facilities
    or contracted facilities, or the failure or refusal of a
    contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, could
    result in product shortages, leading to lost sales. See
    Item 1, “Business—Raw Materials and Product
    Supply,” for more details.

•

A prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our
    business and operating results.

While pharmaceuticals
    have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles, a
    prolonged economic downturn coupled with rising unemployment
    (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured
    population) could lead to decreased utilization of drugs,
    affecting our sales volume. Declining tax revenues attributable
    to the downturn are increasing the pressure on governments to
    reduce health care spending, leading to increasing government
    efforts to control drug prices and utilization. In addition, a
    prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our
    investment portfolio, which could lead to the recognition of
    losses on our corporate investments and increased benefit
    expense related to our pension obligations. Also, if our
    customers, suppliers or collaboration partners experience
    financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer
    collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults
    by suppliers or collaboration partners.

•

We face other risks to our business and operating
    results.

Our business is subject to a number of other
    risks and uncertainties, including:

—

Economic factors over which we have no control, including
    changes in inflation, interest rates, and foreign currency
    exchange rates, can affect our results of operations.

—

Changes in tax laws, including laws related to the remittance of
    foreign earnings or investments in foreign countries with
    favorable tax rates, and settlements of federal, state, and
    foreign tax audits, can affect our results of operations. In its
    budget submission to Congress in February 2010, the Obama
    administration proposed changes to the manner in which the
    U.S. would tax the international income of

U.S.-based

companies. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may
    address this issue, reform of U.S. taxation, including
    taxation of international income, continues to be a topic of
    discussion for the U.S. Congress. A significant change to
    the U.S. tax system, including changes to the taxation of
    international income, could have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations.

—

Changes in accounting standards promulgated by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange
    Commission can affect our financial statements.

—

Our financial statements can also be affected by internal
    factors, such as changes in business strategies and the impact
    of restructurings, asset impairments, technology acquisition and
    disposition transactions, and business combinations.

We undertake no duty to update forward-looking statements.

Item 2.

Properties

Our principal domestic and international executive offices are
    located in Indianapolis. At December 31, 2009, we owned 12
    production and distribution sites in the United States and
    Puerto Rico. Together with the corporate administrative offices,
    these facilities contain an aggregate of approximately
    14.1 million square feet of floor area dedicated to
    production, distribution, and administration. Major production
    sites include Indianapolis and Clinton, Indiana; Carolina,
    Puerto Rico; Branchburg, New Jersey; and Augusta, Georgia.

We own production and distribution sites in 12 countries outside
    the United States and Puerto Rico, containing an aggregate of
    approximately 3.6 million square feet of floor area. Major
    production sites include facilities in France, Ireland, Spain,
    Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.

Our research and development facilities in the United States
    consist of approximately 3.7 million square feet and are
    located primarily in Indianapolis, with smaller sites in
    San Diego and New York City. Our major research and
    development facilities abroad are located in United Kingdom,
    Canada, Singapore, and Spain, and contain an aggregate of
    approximately 350,000 square feet.

We believe that none of our properties is subject to any
    encumbrance, easement, or other restriction that would detract
    materially from its value or impair its use in the operation of
    the business. The buildings we own are of varying ages and in
    good condition.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are a party to various currently pending legal actions,
    government investigations, and environmental proceedings, and we
    anticipate that such actions could be brought against us in the
    future. The most significant of these matters are described
    below or, as noted, in Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis—Legal and Regulatory Matters.”
    While it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal
    actions, investigations and proceedings brought against us, we
    believe that, except as otherwise specifically noted below or in
    Item 7, the resolution of all such matters will not have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results
    of operations in any one accounting period.

Legal
    Proceedings Described in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis

See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis—Legal and Regulatory Matters,” for
    information on various legal proceedings, including but not
    limited to:

•

The U.S. patent litigation involving Alimta, Cymbalta,
    Evista, Gemzar, Strattera, and Xigris

•

The patent litigation outside the U.S. involving Zyprexa

•

The various federal and state investigations relating to our
    sales, marketing, and promotional practices

•

The Zyprexa product liability and related litigation, including
    claims brought on behalf of state Medicaid agencies and private
    healthcare payers

That information is incorporated into this Item by reference.

Other
    Patent Litigation

Cialis:

In July 2005, Vanderbilt University filed a
    lawsuit in the United States District Court in Delaware against
    ICOS Corporation seeking to add three of its scientists as
    co-inventors on the Cialis compound and

method-of-use

patents. In January 2009, the district court judge ruled in our
    favor, declining to add any of these scientists as an inventor
    on either patent. The plaintiff appealed this ruling to the
    Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which heard oral
    arguments in November 2009. We await the court’s decision.
    We believe these claims are without legal merit and expect to
    prevail in the appeal; however, it is not possible to determine
    the outcome. An unfavorable final outcome could have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
    liquidity, and financial position.

In October 2002, Pfizer Inc. was issued a

method-of-use

patent in the United States and commenced a lawsuit in the
    United States District Court in Delaware against us, Lilly ICOS
    LLC, and ICOS Corporation (both later acquired by Lilly)
    alleging that the marketing of Cialis for erectile dysfunction
    infringed this patent. This litigation has been stayed pending
    the outcome of a reexamination of the patent by the
    U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Office has made a
    final rejection of the relevant patent claims which Pfizer has
    appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences. In
    February 2010, the Board affirmed the Office’s rejection of
    these claims. Pfizer has the right to appeal this decision. We
    believe Pfizer’s claims are without merit and expect to
    prevail. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of
    this litigation.


Other
    Product Liability Litigation

We are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability
    lawsuits in the United States involving primarily Zyprexa,
    thimerosal, Byetta, and DES.

We have been named as a defendant in approximately 200 actions
    in the U.S., involving approximately 270 claimants, brought
    in various state courts and federal district courts on behalf of
    children with autism or other neurological disorders who
    received childhood vaccines (manufactured by other companies)
    that contained thimerosal, a generic preservative used in
    certain vaccines in the U.S. beginning in the 1930s. We
    purchased patents and conducted research pertaining to
    thimerosal in the 1920s. We have been named in the suits even
    though we discontinued manufacturing the raw material in 1974
    and discontinued selling it in the United States to vaccine
    manufacturers in 1992. The lawsuits typically name the vaccine
    manufacturers as well as Lilly and other distributors of
    thimerosal, and allege that the children’s exposure to
    thimerosal-containing vaccines caused their autism or other
    neurological disorders. We strongly deny any liability in these
    cases. There is no credible scientific evidence establishing a
    causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and
    autism or other neurological disorders. In addition, we believe
    the majority of the cases should not be prosecuted in the courts
    in which they have been brought because the underlying claims
    are subject to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of
    1986. Implemented in 1988, the Act established a mandatory,
    federally administered no-fault claims process for individuals
    who allege that they were harmed by the administration of
    childhood vaccines. Under the Act, claims must first be brought
    before the U.S. Court of Claims for an award determination
    under the compensation guidelines established pursuant to the
    Act. Claimants who are unsatisfied with their awards under the
    Act may reject the award and seek traditional judicial remedies.

We have been named a defendant in approximately 55 Byetta
    product liability lawsuits involving approximately 280
    plaintiffs, primarily seeking to recover damages for
    pancreatitis experienced by patients prescribed Byetta. We are
    aware of approximately 40 additional claimants who have not yet
    filed suit. The majority of the cases are filed in California
    and coordinated in a Los Angeles Superior Court. In June 2009, a
    lawsuit was filed in Louisiana State Court (Ralph
    Jackson v. Eli Lilly and Company, et al.) seeking to assert
    similar product liability claims on behalf of Louisiana
    residents who were prescribed Byetta; however, the plaintiff
    dropped the class action allegations in a recently-filed amended
    complaint. We believe these claims are without merit and are
    prepared to defend against them vigorously.

In approximately 25 U.S. lawsuits against us involving
    approximately 50 claimants, plaintiffs seek to recover damages
    on behalf of children or grandchildren of women who were
    prescribed DES during pregnancy in the 1950s and 1960s. In
    December 2009, a lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court
    in Washington, D.C. against Lilly and other manufacturers
    (

Michele Fecho, et al v. Eli Lilly and Company, et
    al

) seeking to assert product liability claims on behalf of
    a putative class of men and women allegedly exposed to the
    medicine who claim to have later developed breast cancer. We
    believe these claims are without merit and are prepared to
    defend against them vigorously.

Other
    Marketing Practices Investigations

In November 2008, we received a subpoena from the
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of
    Inspector General in coordination with the U.S. Attorney
    for the Western District of New York seeking production of a
    wide range of documents and information relating to
    reimbursement of Alimta. We are cooperating in this
    investigation.

In August 2003, we received notice that the staff of the SEC is
    conducting an investigation into the compliance by Polish
    subsidiaries of certain pharmaceutical companies, including
    Lilly, with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.
    The staff has issued subpoenas to us requesting production of
    documents related to the investigation. In connection with that
    matter, staffs of the SEC and the Department of Justice (DOJ)
    have expanded their investigation and have asked us to
    voluntarily provide additional information related to certain
    activities of Lilly affiliates in a number of other countries.
    The SEC staff has also issued a subpoena related to activities
    in these countries. We are cooperating with the SEC and the DOJ
    in this investigation.

Shareholder
    Derivative Litigation

In 2007, the company received two demands from shareholders that
    the board of directors cause the company to take legal action
    against current and former directors and others for allegedly
    causing damage to the company through improper marketing of
    Evista, Prozac, and Zyprexa. In accordance with procedures
    established under the Indiana Business Corporation Law (Ind.
    Code

§ 23-1-32),

the board has appointed a committee of independent persons to
    consider the demands and determine what action, if any, the
    company should take in response. Since January 2008, we have
    been served with seven shareholder derivative lawsuits:

Lambrecht, et al. v. Taurel, et al.

, filed
    January 17, 2008, in the United States District Court for
    the Southern District of Indiana;

Staehr, et al. v. Eli
    Lilly and Company, et al.,

filed March 27, 2008, in
    Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis, Indiana;

Waldman, et al., v. Eli Lilly and Company, et al.

,
    filed February 11, 2008, in the United States District
    Court for the Eastern District of New York;

Solomon v.
    Eli Lilly and Company, et al.

, filed March 27, 2008, in
    Marion County Superior Court in


Indianapolis, Indiana;

Robbins v. Taurel, et al.

,
    filed April 9, 2008, in the United States District Court
    for the Eastern District of New York;

City of Taylor General
    Employees Retirement System v. Taurel, et al.

, filed
    April 15, 2008, in the United States District Court for the
    Eastern District of New York; and

Zemprelli v. Taurel,
    et al

., filed June 24, 2008, in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. Two of
    these lawsuits were filed by the shareholders who served the
    demands described above. All seven lawsuits are nominally filed
    on behalf of the company, against various current and former
    directors and officers and allege that the named officers and
    directors harmed the company through the improper marketing of
    Zyprexa, and in certain suits, Evista and Prozac. The Zemprelli
    suit also claims that certain defendants violated
    Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934. We believe these lawsuits are without merit and are
    prepared to defend against them vigorously.

Employee
    Litigation

In April 2006, three former employees and one current employee
    filed a complaint against the company in the U.S. District
    Court for the Southern District of Indiana (

Welch, et
    al. v. Eli Lilly and Company

, filed April 20,
    2006) alleging racial discrimination. Plaintiffs have since
    amended their complaint twice, and the lawsuit currently
    involves 145 individual plaintiffs as well as the national and
    local chapters of the National Association for the Advancement
    of Colored People (NAACP). Although the case was originally
    filed as a putative class action, in September 2009, plaintiffs
    withdrew their request for class certification. We believe these
    claims are without merit and are prepared to defend against them
    vigorously.

We have also been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York
    (

Schaefer-LaRose, et al

.

v. Eli Lilly and Company

,
    filed November 14, 2006) claiming that our
    pharmaceutical sales representatives should have been
    categorized as “non-exempt” rather than
    “exempt” employees, and claiming that the company owes
    them back wages for overtime worked, as well as penalties,
    interest, and attorneys’ fees. Other pharmaceutical
    industry participants face identical lawsuits. The case was
    transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of Indiana in August 2007. In February 2008, the
    Indianapolis court conditionally certified a nationwide opt-in
    collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act of all
    current and former employees who served as a Lilly
    pharmaceutical sales representative at any time from November
    2003 to the present. As of the close of the opt-in period, fewer
    than 400 of the over 7,500 potential plaintiffs elected to
    participate in the lawsuit. In September 2009, the District
    Court granted our motion for summary judgment with regard to
    Ms. Schaefer-LaRose’s claims and ordered the
    plaintiffs to demonstrate why the entire collective action
    should not be decertified within 30 days. Plaintiffs have
    filed a motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment
    decision and have also opposed decertification, and all other
    matters have been stayed pending a ruling on these issues. If
    summary judgment is not reconsidered, we expect plaintiffs will
    appeal the ruling to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. We
    believe this lawsuit is without merit and are prepared to defend
    against it vigorously.

In September 2009, one of the opt-in plaintiffs in

Schaefer-LaRose, et al v. Eli Lilly and Company

filed an action in the Superior Court for Alameda County,
    California, alleging on behalf of a putative class that the
    company violated California’s Business and Professions Code
    by failing to pay sales representatives overtime and by not
    providing them with rest and meal breaks under California law.
    After removing the lawsuit to the federal district court in the
    Northern District of California, the parties agreed, and the
    Court ordered, that the lawsuit would be stayed pending a
    decision from the 9th Circuit in one of the other several
    lawsuits addressing the exempt status of pharmaceutical sales
    representatives. We believe the lawsuit is without merit and are
    prepared to defend against it vigorously.

We have been named in a lawsuit brought by the Labor Attorney
    for 15th Region in the Labor Court of Paulinia, State of
    Sao Paulo, Brazil, alleging possible harm to employees and
    former employees caused by exposure to heavy metals. We have
    also been named in approximately 50 lawsuits filed in the same
    court by individual former employees making similar claims. We
    have also been named, along with several other companies, in a
    lawsuit filed by certain of these individuals in
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on
    April 21, 2009, alleging possible harm caused by exposure
    to pesticides related to our former agricultural chemical
    manufacturing facility in Cosmopolis, Brazil. We believe these
    lawsuits are without merit and are prepared to defend against
    them vigorously.

Other
    Matters

In October 2005, the U.S. Attorney’s office for the
    Eastern District of Pennsylvania advised that it is conducting
    an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into
    with a pharmacy benefit manager covering
    Axid

®

,

    Evista, Humalog, Humulin, Prozac, and Zyprexa. The inquiry
    includes a review of our Medicaid best price reporting related
    to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements. We are
    cooperating in this matter.

In October 2005, we received a subpoena from the
    U.S. Attorney’s office for the District of
    Massachusetts for the production of documents relating to our
    business relationship with a long-term care pharmacy
    organization concerning Actos, Evista, Humalog, Humulin, and
    Zyprexa. We are cooperating in this matter.


Between 2003 and 2005, various municipalities in New York sued
    us and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers, claiming in
    general that as a result of alleged improprieties by the
    manufacturers in the calculation and reporting of average
    wholesale prices for purposes of Medicaid reimbursement, the
    municipalities overpaid their portion of the cost of
    pharmaceuticals. The suits seek monetary and other relief,
    including civil penalties and treble damages. Similar suits were
    filed against us and many other manufacturers by the States of
    Mississippi, Iowa, Utah, and Kansas. These suits are pending
    either in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts or in various state courts. All of these suits are
    in early stages or discovery is ongoing. We believe these
    lawsuits are without merit and are prepared to defend against
    them vigorously.

During 2004 we, along with several other pharmaceutical
    companies, were named in a consolidated lawsuit in California
    state court brought on behalf of consumers alleging that the
    conduct of pharmaceutical companies in preventing commercial
    importation of prescription drugs from outside the United States
    violated antitrust laws. The case sought restitution for alleged
    overpayments for pharmaceuticals and an injunction against the
    allegedly violative conduct. Summary judgment was granted to us
    and the other defendants. In July 2008, the California Court of
    Appeals affirmed that decision. The California Supreme Court has
    accepted plaintiff’s appeal, and we expect it to be heard
    later this year.

In July 2008, we received a request from the Civil Division of
    the United States Department of Justice requesting the
    production of documents related to nominal pricing. In June
    2009, we received a Civil Investigative Demand from the office
    of the Attorney General of Texas requesting documents related to
    nominal pricing of Axid; we divested the marketing rights for
    Axid in 2000. We are cooperating in these matters.

Along with over 100 other pharmaceutical companies operating in
    Europe, in 2008 we received questionnaires from the European
    Commission as part of its inquiry into whether pharmaceutical
    companies improperly blocked or created artificial barriers to
    pharmaceutical innovation or market entry of medicines through
    the misuse of patent rights, settlements of claims, litigation,
    or other means. In July 2009, the Commission released its report
    in which it concluded that the practices of companies
    contributed to delays in the entry of medicines onto the market,
    but that shortcomings in the regulatory framework were also a
    contributing factor. The Commission has subsequently requested
    additional information from the companies. We are cooperating
    with the Commission in this matter.

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
    and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, we have been
    designated as one of several potentially responsible parties
    with respect to the cleanup of fewer than 10 sites. Under
    Superfund, each responsible party may be jointly and severally
    liable for the entire amount of the cleanup.

During routine inspections in 2006 and 2007, the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identified
    potential gaps in our leak detection and repair program (LDAR).
    In addition, in 2006 we voluntarily reported to the state and
    city environmental agencies that we had exceeded an annual limit
    for air emissions. In response to these events, we have
    implemented numerous corrective actions and enhancements to our
    LDAR program. We are currently working with the EPA towards
    resolution of this matter, which will likely require the payment
    of a fine. We do not believe the amount of the fine will be
    material.

We are also a defendant in other litigation and investigations,
    including product liability, patent, employment, and premises
    liability litigation, of a character we regard as normal to our
    business.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

This section provides an overview of our financial results,
    recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, significant
    business development, and legal, regulatory, and other matters
    affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry.

Financial
    Results

We achieved revenue growth of 7 percent in 2009, which was
    primarily driven by the collective growth of Alimta, Cymbalta,
    Humalog, and Zyprexa and the inclusion of Erbitux revenue as a
    result of the ImClone Systems Inc. (Imclone) acquisition in
    November 2008. The impact of changes in foreign currencies
    compared to the U.S. dollar on international inventories
    sold during the year decreased our cost of sales in 2009 and
    increased our cost of sales in 2008, which contributed to an
    improvement in gross margin. Marketing, selling, and
    administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue,
    while our investment in research and development grew at a
    greater rate than sales. We incurred income tax expense of
    $1.03 billion in 2009 resulting in an effective tax rate of
    19.2 percent. Earnings increased to $4.33 billion, and
    earnings per share increased to $3.94 per share, in 2009 as
    compared to a net loss of $2.07 billion, and a loss per
    share of $1.89 in 2008. Net income comparisons between 2009 and
    2008 are affected by the impact of the following significant
    items:


Acquisitions (Note 3)

•

We incurred acquired in-process research and development
    (IPR&D) charges associated with an in-licensing arrangement
    with Incyte Corporation (Incyte) of $90.0 million (pretax),
    which decreased earnings per share by $.05.

Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special
    Charges (Notes 5 and 14)

•

We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other
    special charges of $462.7 million (pretax), which decreased
    earnings per share by $.29 for asset impairments and
    restructuring primarily related to the sale of our Tippecanoe
    Laboratories manufacturing site to an affiliate of Evonik
    Industries AG.

•

We incurred pretax charges of $230.0 million representing
    the currently probable and estimable exposures in connection
    with the claims of several states related to Zyprexa, which
    decreased earnings per share by $.13.



Acquisitions (Note 3)

•

We recognized charges totaling $4.73 billion (pretax)
    associated with the acquisition of ImClone, which decreased
    earnings per share by $4.46. These amounts include an IPR&D
    charge of $4.69 billion (pretax). The remaining net
    expenses are related to ImClone’s operating results
    subsequent to the acquisition, incremental interest costs, and
    amortization of the intangible asset associated with Erbitux. We
    also incurred IPR&D charges of $28.0 million (pretax)
    associated with the acquisition of SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
    (SGX), which decreased earnings per share by $.03.

•

We incurred IPR&D charges associated with licensing
    arrangements with BioMS Medical Corp. (BioMS) and TransPharma
    Medical Ltd. totaling $122.0 million (pretax), which
    decreased earnings per share by $.07.

Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special
    Charges (Notes 5 and 14)

•

We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other
    special charges totaling $497.0 million (pretax), which
    decreased earnings per share by $.30. A similar charge of
    $57.1 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share
    by $.04, was included in cost of sales. These charges were
    primarily associated with the sale of our Greenfield, Indiana
    site, the termination of the
    AIR

®

Insulin program; and strategic exit activities related to
    manufacturing operations.

•

We recorded charges of $1.48 billion (pretax) related to
    the federal and state Zyprexa investigations led by the
    U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
    (EDPA), as well as the resolution of a multi-state investigation
    regarding Zyprexa involving 32 states and the District of
    Columbia, which decreased earnings per share by $1.20.

Other (Note 12)

•

We recognized a discrete income tax benefit of
    $210.3 million as a result of the resolution of a
    substantial portion of the IRS audit of our federal income tax
    returns for the years 2001 through 2004, which increased
    earnings per share by $.19.

Late-Stage
    Pipeline Developments and Business Development
    Activity

Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability
    to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical
    products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in
    development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.
    We currently have over 60 potential new drugs in human testing.
    A number of late-stage pipeline developments and business
    development transactions occurred within the past year,
    including:

Pipeline

•

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an
    expanded indication for Byetta as a standalone medication
    (monotherapy) along with diet and exercise to improve glycemic
    control in adults with type 2 diabetes.

•

The FDA approved Zyprexa Relprevv for extended release
    injectable suspension for the treatment of schizophrenia in
    adults. We also launched this product under the tradename
    Zypadhera in several countries within the European Union.

•

We announced initial results from a Phase III clinical
    trial for arzoxifene. After reviewing the overall clinical
    profile of arzoxifene in light of currently available
    treatments, including our own osteoporosis products, we decided
    not to submit the compound for regulatory review.

•

The FDA approved a new use for Forteo to treat osteoporosis
    associated with sustained, systemic glucocorticoid therapy in
    men and women at high risk of fracture.

•

We and our partner BioMS discontinued Phase III clinical
    trials for dirucotide in patients with secondary progressive
    multiple sclerosis. Data showed that dirucotide did not meet the
    primary endpoint of delaying disease progression and there were
    no statistically significant differences between dirucotide and
    placebo on the secondary endpoints of the study.

•

The FDA approved Effient tablets for the reduction of thrombotic
    cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients
    with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who are managed with an
    artery-opening procedure known as percutaneous coronary
    intervention (PCI). We and our partner, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.,
    launched Effient in the U.S. in August. The European
    Commission granted marketing authorization for
    Efient

®

for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with
    ACS undergoing PCI.

•

The FDA approved Alimta as a maintenance therapy for locally
    advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
    specifically for patients with a nonsquamous histology whose
    disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based
    first-line chemotherapy.

•

The European Commission granted approval for the use of Alimta
    as monotherapy for maintenance treatment of patients with other
    than predominantly squamous cell histology in locally-advanced
    or


metastatic NSCLC, whose disease has not progressed immediately
    following platinum-based chemotherapy.

•

Alimta received regulatory approval in Japan as both a first-
    and second-line treatment of NSCLC.

•

We and our partners Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin) and
    Alkermes, Inc., submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the
    FDA for exenatide once weekly. Exenatide once weekly is an
    investigational sustained release medication for type 2 diabetes
    that is injected subcutaneously and administered only once a
    week.

•

We began enrolling patients in two separate but identical
    Phase III clinical trials of solanezumab, an

anti-amyloid

beta monoclonal antibody being investigated as a potential
    treatment to delay the progression of mild to moderate
    Alzheimer’s disease. The trials each include a treatment
    period that lasts 18 months and are expected to enroll a
    total of 2,000 patients age 55 and over from
    16 countries.

•

The FDA approved two new combination indications for Zyprexa
    (olanzapine) and fluoxetine for the acute treatment of bipolar
    depression and TRD in adults.

•

We received a complete response letter from the FDA for the
    first-line squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)
    supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Erbitux.

Business
    Development

•

We entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration
    agreement with Incyte for the development and commercialization
    of Incyte’s oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, and certain follow-on
    compounds, for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The lead
    compound is currently being studied in a six-month dose-ranging
    Phase II trial for rheumatoid arthritis.

•

We entered into a co-promotion agreement with Kowa
    Pharmaceutical America to commercialize
    Livalo

®

(pitavastatin) in the United States. Lilly and Kowa Company,
    Limited have also entered into a licensing agreement in Latin
    America. Livalo is a statin approved by the FDA in August 2009
    for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia and mixed
    dyslipidemia. We plan to launch Livalo in the U.S. in
    mid-2010.

•

In January 2010, we restructured the collaboration agreement
    executed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and ImClone in 2001 to allow
    for the co-development and co-commercialization of the
    late-stage oncology molecule necitumumab (IMC-11F8), which is
    currently in Phase III clinical testing for non-small cell
    lung cancer. Under the restructured agreement, both companies
    will share in the cost of developing and potentially
    commercializing necitumumab in the U.S., Canada and Japan. We
    maintain exclusive rights to necitumumab in all other markets.

Legal,
    Regulatory, and Other Matters

In September 2009, we set a goal to reduce our expected cost
    structure by $1 billion by the end of 2011. We also plan to
    lower global headcount to 35,000 by the end of 2011, excluding
    strategic sales force additions in high-growth emerging markets
    and Japan, which could result in future periodic restructuring
    charges.

In January 2009, we reached resolution with the Office of the
    U.S. Attorney for the EDPA, and the State Medicaid Fraud
    Control Units of 36 states and the District of Columbia, of
    an investigation related to our U.S. marketing and
    promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. We recorded a
    charge of $1.42 billion for this matter in the third
    quarter of 2008. In 2009, we paid substantially all of this
    amount, as required by the settlement agreements. In addition,
    in October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and
    the District of Columbia related to a multistate investigation
    brought under various state consumer protection laws, under
    which we paid $62.0 million. However, we were served with
    lawsuits brought by attorneys general of a number of states,
    alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high
    blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug
    and seeking to recover the costs paid for Zyprexa through
    Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as well as the costs
    alleged to have been incurred and that will be incurred to treat
    Zyprexa-related illnesses. In 2009, we incurred pretax charges
    of $230.0 million, reflecting the probable and estimable
    exposures in connection with these claims. We have reached
    settlements or are in advanced discussions to settle all of the
    remaining state claims. The Pennsylvania case is set for trial
    in April 2010 in state court.

Health care reform is currently the subject of intense debate in
    the U.S. Congress. The impact of reform on the
    pharmaceutical industry is uncertain. Most reform proposals
    intend to provide coverage for the uninsured, include increasing
    existing price rebates in federally funded health care programs
    and the expansion of rebates, or other pharmaceutical company
    discounts, into new programs. There are also proposals that will
    impose new fees on pharmaceutical industry sales of certain
    prescription pharmaceutical products. Certain federal and state
    health care reform proposals that go beyond providing additional
    health insurance coverage for the uninsured may also place
    downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices.
    These proposals include reducing incentives for
    employer-sponsored health care;


the creation of an independent commission to propose changes to
    Medicare, with a particular focus on the cost of
    biopharmaceuticals in Medicare Part D, which lowers the
    projections for future government spending in Medicare; and a
    government-run public option with biopharmaceutical
    price-setting capabilities. Additionally, various proposals
    could legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either
    allow, or require, the Secretary of Health and Human Services to
    negotiate drug prices within Medicare Part D directly with
    pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, the federal
    government is considering creating an expedited regulatory
    approval pathway for biosimilars (copies of biological
    compounds) for biologic products in the U.S.; the proposals vary
    as to which biologic products would be eligible, how quickly a
    biosimilar might reach the market, and the ability to
    interchange the biosimilar and the original biologic product at
    the pharmacy. We expect pricing pressures at the federal and
    state levels to become more severe, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.

In its budget submission to Congress in February 2010, the Obama
    administration proposed changes to the manner in which the
    U.S. would tax the international income of

U.S.-based

companies. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may
    address this issue, reform of U.S. taxation, including
    taxation of international income, continues to be a topic of
    discussion for the U.S. Congress. A significant change to
    the U.S. tax system, including changes to the taxation of
    international income, could have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated results of operations.

International operations also are generally subject to extensive
    price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for
    additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that
    would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls,
    limit access to or reimbursement for our products, or reduce the
    value of our intellectual property protection. These proposals
    are expected to increase in both frequency and impact, given the
    effect of the downturn in the global economy on local
    governments.

OPERATING
    RESULTS—2009

Revenue

Our worldwide revenue for 2009 increased 7 percent, to
    $21.84 billion, driven primarily by growth of Alimta,
    Cymbalta, Humalog, and Zyprexa, and the inclusion of Erbitux
    revenue as a result of the ImClone acquisition. Worldwide sales
    volume increased 7 percent, while selling prices
    contributed 3 percent of revenue growth, partially offset
    by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of
    3 percent. Revenue in the U.S. increased
    12 percent, to $12.29 billion, due to higher prices
    and higher demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased
    1 percent, to $9.54 billion, due to increased demand,
    partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange
    rates and lower prices.

Collaboration and other revenue is primarily composed of Erbitux
    royalties and 50 percent of Byetta’s gross margin in
    the U.S.


Numbers may not add due to rounding.


Zyprexa, our top-selling product, is a treatment for
    schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with
    bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in
    the U.S. increased 6 percent in 2009, due to higher
    prices, partially offset by reduced demand. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 4 percent driven by increased demand,
    partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange
    rates. Demand outside the U.S. was favorably impacted by
    the withdrawal of generic competition in Germany in early 2009.

Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major
    depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain,
    generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia, increased
    13 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices and
    increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased
    18 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by
    the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower
    prices.

Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the
    treatment of diabetes, increased 20 percent in the U.S.,
    driven by higher prices, increased demand, and wholesaler buying
    patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 3 percent,
    driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable
    impact of foreign exchange rates.

Sales of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased
    45 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased
    demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 50 percent,
    driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable
    impact of foreign exchange rates. Demand outside the
    U.S. benefited from the addition of the non-small cell lung
    cancer indication in Japan.

Our sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction,
    increased 16 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices,
    increased demand, and wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside
    the U.S. increased 3 percent, driven by increased
    demand and to a lesser extent, higher prices, partially offset
    by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to treat various cancers,
    increased 2 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher
    prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 37 percent,
    driven by reduced demand and lower prices as a result of the
    entry of generic competition in most major markets, and to a
    lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of
    osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk
    of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with
    osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive
    breast cancer, decreased 3 percent in the U.S., driven by
    reduced demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside
    the U.S. decreased 7 percent, driven by the
    outlicensing of Evista in most European markets and, to a lesser
    extent, lower prices.

Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment
    of diabetes, increased 6 percent in the U.S., due primarily
    to higher prices, partially offset by reduced demand. Sales
    outside the U.S. decreased 9 percent, driven by the
    unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser
    extent, lower prices, partially offset by increased demand.

Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in
    postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture,
    increased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices,
    partially offset by reduced demand. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 3 percent, driven by increased demand
    and prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of
    foreign exchange rates.

Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit
    hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults,
    increased 2 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices,
    partially offset by reduced demand. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 15 percent, driven by increased demand
    and higher prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of
    foreign exchange rates.

Worldwide sales of Byetta, an injectable product for the
    treatment of type 2 diabetes, increased 6 percent to
    $796.5 million during 2009. We report as revenue our
    50 percent share of Byetta’s gross margin in the U.S.,
    100 percent of Byetta sales outside the U.S., and our sales
    of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin. Our revenues increased
    13 percent to $448.5 million in 2009.

We report as revenue for Erbitux, a product approved to treat
    various cancers, the net royalties received from our
    collaboration partners and our product sales. Our revenues were
    $390.8 million in 2009, compared with $29.4 million in
    2008. We acquired Erbitux as part of our acquisition of ImClone
    in November 2008.

Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased
    25 percent, primarily driven by the inclusion of Posilac
    sales following the acquisition completed October 2008. Sales
    outside the U.S. decreased 4 percent, driven primarily
    by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

Gross
    Margin, Costs, and Expenses

The 2009 gross margin increased to 80.6 percent of
    total revenue compared with 78.5 percent for 2008. This
    increase was due to the impact of changes in foreign currencies
    compared to the U.S. dollar on


international inventories sold during the year, which decreased
    cost of sales as in 2009, but increased cost of sales in 2008.

Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased
    4 percent in 2009 to $6.89 billion. The increase was
    driven by the increased marketing and selling expenses outside
    the U.S., higher incentive compensation, and the impact of the
    ImClone acquisition, partially offset by the movement of foreign
    exchange rates. Investment in research and development increased
    13 percent, to $4.33 billion, due primarily to the
    ImClone acquisition and increased late-stage clinical trial
    costs.

We incurred an IPR&D charge of $90.0 million in 2009,
    associated with the in-licensing agreement with Incyte, compared
    with $4.84 billion in 2008. The 2008 IPR&D charge
    included $4.69 billion resulting from the acquisition of
    ImClone. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and
    other special charges of $692.7 million in 2009, primarily
    related to asset impairment charges related to the sale of our
    Tippecanoe Laboratories manufacturing site and special charges
    related to Zyprexa litigation with multiple state attorneys
    general, compared with $1.97 billion in 2008. The 2008
    charges were primarily associated with the resolution of Zyprexa
    investigations with the U.S. Attorney for the EDPA and
    multiple states. See Notes 3, 5 and 14 to the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information.

Other—net, expense, (income) was a net expense in both
    years, increasing by $203.4 million, to $229.5 million
    in 2009, primarily due to lower interest income and higher
    interest expense resulting from the ImClone acquisition.

We incurred income tax expense of $1.03 billion in 2009
    resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.2 percent. The
    effective tax rate for 2009 was reduced due to the tax benefit
    of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with
    the sale of the Tippecanoe site. We incurred tax expense of
    $764.3 million in 2008, despite having a loss before income
    taxes of $1.31 billion. Our net loss was driven by the
    $4.69 billion IPR&D charge for ImClone and the
    $1.48 billion Zyprexa investigation settlements. The
    IPR&D charge was not tax deductible, and only a portion of
    the Zyprexa investigation settlements was deductible. In
    addition, we recorded tax expense associated with the ImClone
    acquisition, as well as a discrete income tax benefit of
    $210.3 million for the resolution of a substantial portion
    of the

2001-2004

IRS audit. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information.

OPERATING
    RESULTS—2008

Financial
    Results

We achieved worldwide sales growth of 9 percent, which was
    primarily driven by volume increases in several key products.
    The favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on cost of sales
    contributed to an improvement in gross margin. Marketing,
    selling, and administrative expenses grew at the same rate as
    sales, driven by pre-launch activities associated with Effient,
    marketing costs associated with Cymbalta and Evista, the impact
    of foreign exchange rates, and increased litigation-related
    expenses, while our investment in research and development grew
    10 percent. We completed our acquisition of ImClone,
    resulting in a significant charge of $4.69 billion for
    IPR&D and reached resolution on government investigations
    related to our past U.S. marketing and promotional
    practices for Zyprexa, resulting in an additional charge of
    $1.48 billion. We incurred tax expense of
    $764.3 million, despite a loss before income taxes of
    $1.31 billion, primarily caused by the non-deductibility of
    the ImClone IPR&D charge and the partial deductibility of
    the Zyprexa investigation settlements. Accordingly, earnings
    decreased to a net loss of $2.07 billion, and earnings per
    share decreased to a loss of $1.89 per share, in 2008 as
    compared with net income of $2.95 billion, and earnings per
    share of $2.71, in 2007. Net income comparisons between 2008 and
    2007 are affected by the impact of several significant items.
    The significant items for 2008 are summarized in the Executive
    Overview. The 2007 items are summarized as follows:

Acquisitions (Note 3)

•

We incurred IPR&D charges associated with the acquisitions
    of ICOS Corporation (ICOS), Hypnion, Inc. (Hypnion), and
    Ivy Animal Health, Inc. (Ivy), totaling $631.6 million
    (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.57.

•

We incurred IPR&D charges associated with our licensing
    arrangements with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited India,
    MacroGenics, Inc., and OSI Pharmaceuticals, totaling
    $114.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share
    by $.06.

Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special
    Charges (Notes 5 and 14)

•

We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other
    special charges of $190.6 million (pretax), which decreased
    earnings per share by $.12. These charges were primarily
    associated with previously announced strategic decisions
    affecting manufacturing and research facilities.

•

We incurred a special charge following a settlement with one of
    our insurance carriers over Zyprexa product liability claims,
    which led to a reduction of our expected product liability
    insurance recoveries, and other product liability charges. This
    resulted in a charge totaling $111.9 million (pretax),
    which decreased earnings per share by $.09.


Revenue

Our worldwide revenue for 2008 increased 9 percent, to
    $20.37 billion, driven primarily by growth of Cymbalta,
    Cialis, Alimta, Humalog, and Gemzar. Worldwide sales volume
    increased 5 percent, while foreign exchange rates
    contributed 3 percent, and selling prices contributed
    2 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.) Revenue in
    the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $10.93 billion,
    driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, Humalog,
    Cialis, and Alimta. Revenue outside the U.S. increased
    11 percent, to $9.44 billion, driven primarily by
    revenue growth of Alimta, Cialis, Cymbalta, and Humalog.

U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.


Prior to the acquisition of ICOS in late January 2007, the
    Cialis revenue shown does not include net product sales in the
    joint-venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America,
    excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the
    joint-venture territory net product sales for January 2007, net
    of expenses and income taxes, is reported in
    other

—

net, expense (income) in our consolidated
    statements of operations. Subsequent to the acquisition, all
    Cialis net product sales are reported in our net revenue.
    Worldwide 2008 revenue for Cialis grew 19 percent from 2007
    revenue of $1.22 billion.


Collaboration and other revenue is primarily composed of
    50 percent of Byetta’s gross margin in the U.S.

Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 1 percent in 2008,
    driven by reduced demand, partially offset by higher prices.
    Sales outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by
    decreased demand and, to a lesser extent, lower prices,
    partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange
    rates. Demand outside the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by
    generic competition in Germany and Canada.

Sales of Cymbalta increased 23 percent in the U.S., driven
    by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices.
    Sales outside the U.S. increased 66 percent, driven by
    increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact
    of foreign exchange rates and higher prices. Higher demand
    outside the U.S. reflects increased demand in established
    markets as well as recent launches in new markets.

Sales of Humalog increased 14 percent in the U.S., driven
    by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 24 percent, driven by increased demand
    and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates.

Sales of Gemzar increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by
    increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 7 percent, driven primarily by the
    favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser
    extent, increased demand, partially offset by lower prices.

Sales of Cialis increased 27 percent in the U.S., driven by
    increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 26 percent, driven by increased demand
    and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates and higher prices. Total worldwide sales of
    Cialis increased 19 percent


to $1.44 billion in 2008 as compared to $1.22 billion
    in 2007. This includes $72.7 million of sales in the Lilly
    ICOS joint-venture territories for the 2007 period prior to the
    acquisition of ICOS.

Sales of Alimta increased 25 percent in the U.S., driven by
    increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales
    outside the U.S. increased 46 percent, driven by
    increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact
    of foreign exchange rates.

Sales of Evista decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by
    decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales
    outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent, driven by
    reduced demand and lower prices, partially offset by the
    favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

Sales of Humulin increased 4 percent in the U.S., driven by
    higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased
    10 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates and increased demand.

Sales of Forteo decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by
    decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales
    outside the U.S. increased 34 percent, driven by
    increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact
    of foreign exchange rates.

Sales of Strattera decreased 6 percent in the U.S., driven
    by decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales
    outside the U.S. increased 35 percent, driven
    primarily by increased demand.

Worldwide sales of Byetta increased 16 percent to
    $751.4 million during 2008. Our revenues increased
    20 percent to $396.1 million in 2008.

Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased
    12 percent, driven by the inclusion of U.S. Posilac
    sales since the date of acquisition. Sales outside the
    U.S. increased 8 percent, driven by increased demand
    and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates.

Gross
    Margin, Costs, and Expenses

The 2008 gross margin increased to 78.5 percent of
    total revenue compared with 77.2 percent for 2007. This
    increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange rates.

Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased
    9 percent in 2008, to $6.63 billion. This increase was
    due to increased marketing and selling expenses, including
    prelaunch expenses for Effient and marketing costs associated
    with Cymbalta and Evista; the impact of foreign exchange rates;
    and increased litigation-related expenses. Investment in
    research and development increased 10 percent, to
    $3.84 billion, due to increased late-stage clinical trial
    and discovery research costs.

Acquired IPR&D charges related to the acquisitions of
    ImClone and SGX, as well as our in-licensing arrangements with
    BioMS and TransPharma, were $4.84 billion in 2008 as
    compared to $745.6 million in 2007. We recognized asset
    impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of
    $1.97 billion in 2008, as compared to $302.5 million
    in 2007. The 2008 charges were primarily associated with the
    resolution of Zyprexa investigations with the U.S. Attorney
    for the EDPA and multiple states. See Notes 3, 5 and 14 to
    the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Other

—

net, expense (income) changed from net income
    of $122.0 million in 2007 to net expense of
    $26.1 million in 2008, primarily as a result of lower
    outlicensing income and increased net losses on investment
    securities in 2008 (the majority of which consisted of
    unrealized losses).

We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million in 2008, despite
    having a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion. Our net
    loss was driven by the $4.69 billion acquired IPR&D
    charge for ImClone and the $1.48 billion Zyprexa
    investigation settlements. The IPR&D charge was not tax
    deductible, and only a portion of the Zyprexa investigation
    settlements was deductible. In addition, we recorded tax expense
    associated with the ImClone acquisition, as well as a discrete
    income tax benefit of $210.3 million for the resolution of
    a substantial portion of the

2001-2004

IRS audit. The effective tax rate was 23.8 percent in 2007.
    See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

As of December 31, 2009, cash, cash equivalents, and
    short-term investments totaled $4.50 billion compared with
    $5.93 billion at December 31, 2008. The decrease in
    cash was driven by a reduction in short-term borrowings of
    $5.82 billion and dividends paid of $2.15 billion,
    partially offset by cash from operations of $4.34 billion
    (which included payments related to the Zyprexa EDPA settlement
    of $1.39 billion) and proceeds of long-term debt issuances
    of $2.40 billion.

Capital expenditures of $765.0 million during 2009 were
    $182.2 million less than in 2008. We expect 2010 capital
    expenditures to be approximately $1.0 billion as we invest
    in our biotechnology capabilities, continue to upgrade our
    manufacturing and research facilities to enhance productivity
    and quality systems, and invest in the long-term growth of our
    diabetes care products.

Total debt at December 31, 2009, was $6.66 billion, a
    decrease of $3.80 billion from December 31, 2008
    reflecting the pay-down of our commercial paper that was issued
    to finance our acquisition of ImClone, partially offset by
    $2.40 billion of long-term debt we issued in March 2009.
    Our current debt ratings from Standard & Poor’s
    and Moody’s remain at AA and A1, respectively.


Dividends of $1.96 per share were paid in 2009, an increase of
    4 percent from 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2009,
    effective for the first-quarter dividend in 2010, the quarterly
    dividend was maintained at $.49 per share, resulting in an
    indicated annual rate for 2010 of $1.96 per share. The year 2009
    was the 125th consecutive year in which we made dividend
    payments.

Despite increasing unemployment and declines in real consumer
    spending, consumer confidence has grown and job losses have
    slowed during the second half of 2009. Many financial
    institutions continue to have tightened lines of credit, thus
    reducing funding available to stimulate near-term economic
    growth. While there are some positive signs, the prospects for
    recovery are uncertain. Pharmaceutical consumption has
    traditionally been relatively unaffected by economic downturns;
    however, an extended downturn could lead to a decline in overall
    prescriptions corresponding to the growth of the uninsured and
    underinsured population in the U.S. In addition, both
    private and public health care payers are facing heightened
    fiscal challenges due to the economic slowdown and are taking
    aggressive steps to reduce the costs of care, including
    pressures for increased pharmaceutical discounts and rebates and
    efforts to drive greater use of generic drugs. We continue to
    monitor the potential near-term impact of prescription trends,
    the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers and
    suppliers, the evolving health care debate, the federal
    government’s involvement in the economic crisis, and
    various international government funding levels.

We believe that cash generated from operations, along with
    available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund
    our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital
    expenditures, costs associated with litigation and government
    investigations, and dividends in 2010. We believe that amounts
    accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be
    adequate to fund short-term borrowings. Our access to credit
    markets has not been adversely affected by the illiquidity in
    the markets because of the high credit quality of our short- and
    long-term debt. We currently have $1.24 billion of unused
    committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which
    backs our commercial paper program and matures in May 2011.
    Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in
    Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” may affect our operating
    results and cash generated from operations.

We depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property
    protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings.
    In the next three years we will lose effective exclusivity for
    Zyprexa in major European countries (September 2011) and
    the U.S. (October 2011); and for Humalog in major European
    countries (November 2010). Gemzar has already lost effective
    exclusivity in major European countries. In addition, we face
    U.S. patent litigation over several key patent-protected
    products whose exclusivity extends beyond 2012, including
    Alimta, Cymbalta, Evista, Gemzar, and Strattera and it is
    possible we could face an unexpected loss of our effective
    exclusivity for one or more of these products prior to the end
    of 2012. Revenue from each of these products contributes
    materially to our results of operations, liquidity, and
    financial position, and the loss of exclusivity could result in
    a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product.
    However, we plan to mitigate the effect on our operations,
    liquidity and financial position through growth in our remaining
    business and the previously announced plan to reduce our
    expected cost structure by $1 billion by the end of 2011.

In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to
    fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These
    fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and
    operating. We address a portion of these risks through a
    controlled program of risk management that includes the use of
    derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling
    these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations
    in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative
    activities are for purposes other than trading.

Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in
    short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to
    manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an
    acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt
    positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help
    maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate
    exposure at December 31, 2009 and 2008, including
    derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments,
    a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied
    to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, would have no material impact on
    earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate
    risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.

Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating
    currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against
    the euro and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the
    euro. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when
    we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis,
    denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also
    face currency exposure that arises from translating the results
    of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange
    rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We
    may use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our
    foreign currency exposures. Our policy outlines the minimum and
    maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on
    these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of
    currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities,
    commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our
    derivative financial instruments outstanding at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, a hypothetical 10 percent
    change in exchange rates (primarily against the
    U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,


respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash
    flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk-sensitive
    instruments over a one-year period. These calculations do not
    reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the
    underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the
    results of the derivative instruments.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material
    current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material
    future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
    condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
    liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We
    acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter
    into research and development arrangements with third parties
    that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third
    party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events
    linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone
    payments may be required contingent upon the successful
    achievement of an important point in the development life cycle
    of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for
    marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the
    achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the
    arrangement, we may have to make royalty payments based upon a
    percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the
    event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained.
    Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not
    included in the table of contractual obligations.

Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one
    annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple
    products covered by these arrangements would happen to be
    reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to
    expense could be material to the results of operations in any
    one period. These arrangements often give us the discretion to
    unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would
    allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we
    are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully
    achieves clinical testing objectives. We also note that, from a
    business perspective, we view these payments as positive because
    they signify that the product is successfully moving through
    development and is now generating or is more likely to generate
    cash flows from sales of products.

Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will
    require future cash payments are as follows (in millions):

Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected
    principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps.
    We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31,
    2009 to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for
    interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps.


We have included the following:

•

Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase
    orders at our significant operating locations as of
    December 31, 2009. Some of these purchase orders may be
    cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have
    not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase
    obligations.

•

Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant
    vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent.


We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of
    our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and
    deferred compensation liabilities. We excluded liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits of $1,088.4 million, as we cannot
    reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows
    associated with those liabilities.


This category comprises primarily minimum pension funding
    requirements.


The contractual obligations table is current as of
    December 31, 2009. We expect the amount of these
    obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are
    initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or
    modified.

APPLICATION
    OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In preparing our financial statements in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related
    disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and
    complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those
    estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we
    make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable
    judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop
    different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and
    circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other
    reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated results of operations, financial position, or
    liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most
    critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit
    committee and are described below.

Revenue
    Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount
    Accruals

We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of
    goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and
    rewards of ownership. For more than 85 percent of our
    sales, this is at the time products are shipped to the customer,
    typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. The
    remaining sales, which are outside the U.S., are recorded at the
    point of delivery. Provisions for returns, rebates, and
    discounts are established in the same period the related sales
    are recorded.

We regularly review the supply levels of our significant
    products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major
    markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic
    inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and
    available prescription volume information for our products, or
    alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler
    inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or
    less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes
    of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or
    anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated
    changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday
    stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the
    U.S., the current structure of our arrangements does not provide
    an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us
    with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we
    believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual
    increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared
    with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales
    discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product
    sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately
    quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. Wholesaler
    stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any
    material changes in the rate of actual product returns.

We establish sales return accruals for anticipated product
    returns. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive
    at our net product sales. Once the product is returned, it is
    destroyed. Consistent with Revenue Recognition accounting
    guidance, we estimate a reserve when the sales occur for future
    product returns related to those sales. This estimate is
    primarily based on historical return rates as well as
    specifically identified anticipated returns due to known
    business conditions and product expiry dates. Actual product
    returns have been less than one percent of our net sales over
    the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a
    percent of sales.

We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same
    period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are
    recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales.
    Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in
    the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care,
    Medicare, chargebacks, long-term-care, hospital, patient
    assistance programs, and various other government programs. We
    base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and
    discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the
    provisions of current rebate and discount contracts.

The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates
    associated with sales covered by Medicaid. In determining the
    appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid
    rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical
    sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, an
    evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and
    interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to
    Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate
    and discount contracts. Although we accrue a liability for
    Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the
    product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is
    typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag,
    in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate
    revisions of accruals for several periods.

Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or
    legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the
    same period as the related sales. In some large European
    countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated
    pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of
    these


rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted
    deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale.
    If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical
    budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves.

We believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and
    discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts
    and circumstances. U.S. sales returns, federally mandated
    Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs
    (Medicaid) and Medicare rebates reduced sales by
    $1.20 billion, $1.03 billion, and $738.8 million
    in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. A 5 percent change
    in the sales return, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate amounts we
    recognized in 2009 would lead to an approximate $60 million
    effect on our income before income taxes. As of
    December 31, 2009, our sales returns, Medicaid, and
    Medicare rebate liability was $692.3 million.

Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales
    rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our
    global sales return liability is included in other current
    liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated
    balance sheet. Approximately 84 percent and 80 percent
    of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability
    resulted from sales of our products in the U.S. as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following
    represents a roll-forward of our most significant
    U.S. returns, rebate, and discount liability balances,

Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and
    discounts to actual results were less than 0.1 percent of
    net sales for each of the years presented.

Product
    Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies

Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by
    their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and
    probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product
    litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability
    amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation,
    the nature and the number of other similar current and past
    litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current
    assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the
    likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement
    discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product
    liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can
    formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate
    these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience
    and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs
    expected to be incurred in connection with significant product
    liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable.

We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the
    exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our
    insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and
    exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the
    insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and
    the possibility of and length of time for collection. In the
    past few years, we have been unable to obtain product liability
    insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore,
    for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we
    have been and expect that we will continue to be completely
    self-insured for future product liability losses. In addition,
    there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect
    from our insurance carriers in the future.

The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the
    related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on
    a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our
    consolidated balance sheets.

We believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we
    have established for product litigation liabilities and other
    contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and
    circumstances.

Pension
    and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions

Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate,
    retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree
    medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate,
    retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and
    health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a
    significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the
    analysis below, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information regarding our retirement
    benefits.

Periodically, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected
    return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree
    health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we
    consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount
    rates, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost
    trend


rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared
    with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions
    and asset allocations (approximately 88 percent of which
    are growth investments); and the views of leading financial
    advisers and economists. We use an actuarially determined,
    company-specific yield curve to determine the discount rate. In
    evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider
    the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension
    and medical benefits together with our expectations of future
    retirement ages.

We believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are
    appropriate based upon the above factors. If the
    health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one
    percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service
    cost and interest cost components of the 2009 annual expense
    would increase by $18.9 million. A one-percentage-point
    decrease would lower the aggregate of the 2009 service cost and
    interest cost by $15.8 million. If the 2009 discount rate
    for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health
    benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to be changed by a quarter
    percentage point, income before income taxes would change by
    $23.6 million. If the 2009 expected return on plan assets
    for U.S. plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage
    point, income before income taxes would change by
    $16.8 million. If our assumption regarding the 2009
    expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were
    adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be
    affected by $27.7 million. The U.S. plans represent
    approximately 82 percent of the total accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligation and approximately
    83 percent of total plan assets at December 31, 2009.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both
    intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic
    basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We
    determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted
    cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value.
    If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the
    excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value,
    and the cost basis is adjusted. The estimated future cash flows,
    based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections,
    require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary
    from these estimates.

Income
    Taxes

We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of
    tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these
    judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business,
    our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing
    authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and
    penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties
    exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax
    law resulting from legislation, regulation,

and/or

as
    concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court
    systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
    position only if it is more likely than not that the tax
    position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
    authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The
    tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a
    position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a
    greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon
    ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is
    adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example,
    adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing
    tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by
    the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax
    examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe that
    our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and
    sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations
    of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and
    penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax
    expense.

We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our
    deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated
    from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in
    certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would
    more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have
    not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies
    in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where
    history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of
    tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or
    future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to
    the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of
    income tax expense.

We believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions
    and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are
    appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. A
    5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax
    positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change
    in net income of $41.8 million and $41.8 million,
    respectively.

FINANCIAL
    EXPECTATIONS FOR 2010

For the full year of 2010, we expect earnings per share to be in
    the range of $4.65 to $4.85, excluding the potential impact of
    health care reform in the U.S. and restructuring charges
    resulting from previously announced strategic headcount
    reductions. We expect volume-driven revenue growth in the
    high-single digits, driven primarily by Alimta, Cymbalta,
    Humalog, Cialis, Effient and the exenatide franchise. We
    anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be
    flat to declining. Marketing, selling, and


administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low- to
    mid-single digits while research and development expenses are
    projected to grow in the low-double digits. Other—net,
    expense (income) is expected to be a net expense of between
    $150.0 million and $200.0 million. Cash flows are expected
    to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately
    $1.0 billion, anticipated business development activity,
    and our dividend.

We caution investors that any forward-looking statements or
    projections made by us, including those above, are based on
    management’s belief at the time they are made. However,
    they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results
    could differ materially and will depend on, among other things,
    the continuing growth of our currently marketed products;
    developments with competitive products; the timing and scope of
    regulatory approvals and the success of our new product
    launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of
    compounds under development resulting in acquired in-process
    research and development charges; foreign exchange rates and
    global macroeconomic conditions; changes in effective tax rates;
    wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments,
    litigation, patent disputes, and government investigations; and
    the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing,
    importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, as well as
    proposed health care reform currently being discussed by the
    U.S. Congress. We undertake no duty to update these
    forward-looking statements.

LEGAL
    AND REGULATORY MATTERS

We are a party to various legal actions and government
    investigations. The most significant of these are described
    below. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of
    these matters, we believe that, except as specifically noted
    below, the resolution of all such matters will not have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated
    results of operations in any one accounting period.

Patent
    Litigation

We are engaged in the following patent litigation matters
    brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch-Waxman Act
    (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of
    1984):

•

Cymbalta:

Sixteen generic drug manufacturers
    have submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) seeking
    permission to market generic versions of Cymbalta prior to the
    expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (the earliest of
    which expires in 2013). Of these challengers, all allege
    non-infringement of the patent claims directed to the commercial
    formulation, and nine allege invalidity of the patent claims
    directed to the active ingredient duloxetine. Of the nine
    challengers to the compound patent claims, one further alleges
    invalidity of the claims directed to the use of Cymbalta for
    treating fibromyalgia, and one alleges the patent having claims
    directed to the active ingredient is unenforceable. In November
    2008 we filed lawsuits in U.S. District Court for the
    Southern District of Indiana against Actavis Elizabeth LLC;
    Aurobindo Pharma Ltd.; Cobalt Laboratories, Inc.; Impax
    Laboratories, Inc.; Lupin Limited; Sandoz Inc.; and Wockhardt
    Limited, seeking rulings that the patents are valid, infringed,
    and enforceable. We filed similar lawsuits in the same court
    against Sun Pharma Global, Inc. in December 2008 and against
    Anchen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in August 2009. The cases have been
    consolidated and actions against all but Wockhardt Limited have
    been stayed pursuant to stipulations by the defendants to be
    bound by the outcome of the litigation through appeal.

•

Gemzar:

Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc., now Hospira,
    Inc. (Hospira); Fresenius Kabi Oncology Plc (Fresenius); Sicor
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., now Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc.
    (Teva); and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) each
    submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic versions
    of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant
    U.S. patents (compound patent expiring in 2010 and

method-of-use

patent expiring in 2013), and alleging that these patents are
    invalid. Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz) and APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC (APP)
    have similarly challenged our

method-of-use

patent. We filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for
    the Southern District of Indiana against Teva (February 2006),
    Hospira (October 2006 and January 2008), Sandoz (October 2009),
    APP (December 2009), and Fresenius (February 2010), seeking
    rulings that our patents are valid and are being infringed.
    Sandoz withdrew its ANDA and the suit against it was dismissed
    in February 2010. The trial against Teva was held in September
    2009 and we are waiting for a ruling. Teva’s ANDAs have
    been approved by the FDA; however, Teva must provide
    90 days notice prior to marketing generic Gemzar to allow
    time for us to seek a preliminary injunction. Both suits against
    Hospira have been administratively closed, and the parties have
    agreed to be bound by the results of the Teva suit. In November
    2007, Sun filed a declaratory judgment action in the United
    States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan,
    seeking rulings that our

method-of-use

and compound patents are invalid or unenforceable, or would not
    be infringed by the sale of Sun’s generic product. In
    August 2009, the District Court granted a motion by Sun for
    partial summary judgment, invalidating our

method-of-use

patent. We have appealed this decision. This ruling has no
    bearing on the compound patent. The trial originally scheduled
    for December 2009 has been postponed while the court considers
    Sun’s second summary judgment motion, related to the
    validity of our compound patent.


Sun and APP have received tentative approval for their products
    from the FDA, but are prohibited from entering the market by

30-month

stays, which expire in June 2010 for Sun and May 2012 for APP.

•

Alimta:

Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc.
    (Teva), APP, and Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr) each submitted
    ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of Alimta
    prior to the expiration of the relevant U.S. patent
    (licensed from the Trustees of Princeton University and expiring
    in 2016), and alleging the patent is invalid. We, along with
    Princeton, filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for
    the District of Delaware against Teva, APP, and Barr seeking
    rulings that the compound patent is valid and infringed. Trial
    is scheduled for November 2010 against Teva and APP.

•

Evista:

In 2006, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA,
    Inc. (Teva) submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a
    generic version of Evista prior to the expiration of our
    relevant U.S. patents (expiring in

2012-2017)

and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or
    not infringed. In June 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in
    the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
    Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid,
    enforceable, and being infringed by Teva. The trial against Teva
    was completed in March 2009. In September 2009, the court upheld
    our

method-of-use

patents (the last expires in 2014). Teva has appealed that
    ruling. In addition, the court held that our particle-size
    patent (expiring 2017) is invalid. We have appealed that
    ruling.

•

Strattera:

Actavis Elizabeth LLC (Actavis),
    Apotex Inc. (Apotex), Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. (Aurobindo), Mylan
    Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan), Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), Sun
    Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Sun), and Teva
    Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) each submitted an ANDA seeking
    permission to market generic versions of Strattera prior to the
    expiration of our relevant U.S. patent (expiring in 2017),
    and alleging that this patent is invalid. In 2007, we brought a
    lawsuit against Actavis, Apotex, Aurobindo, Mylan, Sandoz, Sun,
    and Teva in the United States District Court for the District of
    New Jersey. The court has ruled on all pending summary judgment
    motions, and granted our infringement motion. The remaining
    invalidity defenses will be decided at trial, which could take
    place as early as the third quarter of 2010. Several companies
    have received tentative approval to market generic atomoxetine,
    but are prohibited from entering the market by a

30-month

stay which expires in November 2010.

We believe each of these Hatch-Waxman challenges is without
    merit and expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is
    not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and
    accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail.
    An unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a
    material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity, and financial position.

We have received challenges to Zyprexa patents in a number of
    countries outside the U.S.:

•

In Canada, several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have
    challenged the validity of our Zyprexa patent (expiring in
    2011). In April 2007, the Canadian Federal Court ruled against
    the first challenger, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and that ruling was
    affirmed on appeal in February 2008. In June 2007, the Canadian
    Federal Court held that an invalidity allegation of a second
    challenger, Novopharm Ltd. (Novopharm), was justified and denied
    our request that Novopharm be prohibited from receiving
    marketing approval for generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm
    began selling generic olanzapine in Canada in the third quarter
    of 2007. In September 2009, the Canadian Federal Court ruled
    against us in the Novapharm suit, finding our patent invalid. We
    have appealed this decision. If the decision is upheld, we could
    face liability for damages related to delays in the launch of
    generic olanzapine products; however, we have concluded at this
    time that the damages are not probable or estimable.

•

In Germany, the German Federal Supreme Court upheld the validity
    of our Zyprexa patent (expiring in 2011) in December 2008,
    reversing an earlier decision of the Federal Patent Court.
    Following the decision of the Supreme Court, the generic
    companies who launched generic olanzapine based on the earlier
    decision either agreed to withdraw from the market or were
    subject to injunction. We are pursuing these companies for
    damages arising from infringement.

•

We have received challenges in a number of other countries,
    including Spain, the United Kingdom (U.K.), and several smaller
    European countries. In Spain, we have been successful at both
    the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the generic
    manufacturers’ challenges, but additional actions are now
    pending. In the U.K., the generic pharmaceutical manufacturer
    Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (UK) Limited
    (Dr. Reddy’s) has challenged the validity of our
    Zyprexa patent (expiring in 2011). In October 2008, the Patents
    Court in the High Court, London ruled that our patent was valid.
    Dr. Reddy’s appealed this decision. The U.K. Court of
    Appeal affirmed the validity of the patent in December 2009.
    Dr. Reddy’s did not seek further appeal to the U.K.
    Supreme Court, therefore the U.K. proceedings are concluded.

We are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our
    Zyprexa patents on a

country-by-country

basis. We cannot determine the outcome of this litigation. The
    availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could
    have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
    operations.

Xigris and Evista:

In June 2002, Ariad
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ariad), the Massachusetts Institute of
    Technology, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and
    the President and Fellows of Harvard


College in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts sued us, alleging that sales of two of our
    products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a
    patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling
    phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on past and
    future sales of these products. Following jury and bench trials
    on separate issues, the U.S. District Court of
    Massachusetts entered final judgment in September 2007 that
    Ariad’s claims were valid, infringed, and enforceable, and
    finding damages in the amount of $65 million plus a
    2.3 percent royalty on net U.S. sales of Xigris and
    Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the Court
    deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all
    rights to appeal are exhausted. In April 2009, the Court of
    Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned the District Court
    judgment, concluding that Ariad’s asserted patent claims
    are invalid. In August 2009, the Court of Appeals agreed to
    review this decision en banc, thereby vacating the Court of
    Appeals decision. The en banc hearing occurred in December 2009
    and we are awaiting a decision. Nevertheless, we believe that
    these allegations are without legal merit, that we will
    ultimately prevail on these issues, and therefore that the
    likelihood of any monetary damages is remote.

Zyprexa
    Litigation

We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa
    product liability lawsuits in the U.S. and have been
    notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed
    suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the
    “claims”) allege a variety of injuries from the use of
    Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or
    contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims
    seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically
    accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side
    effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we
    improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits
    are part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding
    before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District
    Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596).

Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various
    claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product
    liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the
    claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 32,670
    claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits
    and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as
    follows:

•

In 2005, we settled and paid more than 8,000 claims for
    $690.0 million, plus $10.0 million to cover
    administration of the settlement.

•

In 2007, we settled and paid more than 18,000 claims for
    approximately $500 million.

We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in
    all remaining claims. The U.S. Zyprexa product liability
    claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 170
    lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 260 plaintiffs,
    of which about 140 cases covering about 150 plaintiffs are part
    of the MDL. The MDL cases have been scheduled for trial in
    groups, and no specific trial dates for trial groups have been
    assigned. We also have trials scheduled in Texas state court in
    May and August 2010 and in Ohio in August 2010.

In January 2009, we reached resolution with the Office of the
    U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
    (EDPA), and the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units of
    36 states and the District of Columbia, of an investigation
    related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices
    with respect to Zyprexa. As part of the resolution, we pled
    guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug, and
    Cosmetic Act for the off-label promotion of Zyprexa in elderly
    populations as treatment for dementia, including
    Alzheimer’s dementia, between September 1999 and March
    2001. We recorded a charge of $1.42 billion for this matter
    in the third quarter of 2008. In 2009, we paid substantially all
    of this amount, as required by the settlement agreements. As
    part of the settlement, we have entered into a corporate
    integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG)
    of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),
    which requires us to maintain our compliance program and to
    undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for
    five years. The agreement also provides for an independent
    third-party review organization to assess and report on the
    company’s systems, processes, policies, procedures, and
    practices.

In October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and
    the District of Columbia related to a multistate investigation
    brought under various state consumer protection laws. While
    there is no finding that we have violated any provision of the
    state laws under which the investigations were conducted, we
    accrued and paid $62.0 million and agreed to undertake
    certain commitments regarding Zyprexa for a period of six years,
    through consent decrees filed with the settling states.

We have been served with lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska,
    Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi,
    Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and
    West Virginia alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to
    diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly
    promoted the drug. These suits seek to recover the costs paid
    for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as
    well as the costs alleged to have been incurred and that will be
    incurred by the states to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. The
    Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana,
    New Mexico, and West Virginia cases are part of the MDL
    proceedings in the EDNY.


The Alaska case was settled in March 2008 for a payment of
    $15.0 million, plus terms designed to ensure, subject to
    certain limitations and conditions, that Alaska is treated as
    favorably as certain other states that may settle with us in the
    future over similar claims. We are in advanced discussions with
    the attorneys general for several of these states, seeking to
    resolve their Zyprexa-related claims, and we have agreed to
    settlements with the states of Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho,
    Mississippi, New Mexico, South Carolina, Utah, and West
    Virginia. In the second and third quarters of 2009, we incurred
    pretax charges of $105.0 million and $125.0 million,
    respectively, reflecting the currently probable and estimable
    exposures in connection with these claims. The Pennsylvania case
    is set for trial in April 2010 in state court.

In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be
    nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and
    third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have
    made or will make payments for their members or insured patients
    being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been
    consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under
    certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil
    RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the
    cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and
    attorneys’ fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the
    EDNY in 2006 on similar grounds. In September 2008, Judge
    Weinstein certified a class consisting of third-party payors,
    excluding governmental entities and individual consumers. We
    appealed the certification order, and Judge Weinstein’s
    order denying our motion for summary judgment, in September
    2008. While the Second Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral
    arguments on the appeal in December 2009, no opinions have been
    rendered. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund
    brought claims in state court in Pennsylvania as insurer of
    Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa on
    similar grounds as described in the New York cases. As with the
    product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we
    inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa
    and improperly promoted the drug. In December 2009, the court
    granted our summary judgment motion, dismissing the case.
    Plaintiffs have appealed this decision.

In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits seeking class
    action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa.
    One of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of
    Quebec, and a second has been certified in Ontario and includes
    all Canadian residents except for residents of Quebec and
    British Columbia. The allegations in the Canadian actions are
    similar to those in the product liability litigation pending in
    the U.S. We are in advanced discussions to resolve all
    Zyprexa class-action litigation in Canada.

We cannot determine with certainty the additional number of
    lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. The ultimate
    resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation
    could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results
    of operations, liquidity, and financial position.

Other
    Product Liability Litigation

We have been named as a defendant in numerous other product
    liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES),
    thimerosal, and Byetta. The majority of these claims are covered
    by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits.

Product
    Liability Insurance

Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible
    that we could become subject to large numbers of product
    liability and related claims for other products in the future.
    In the past several years, we have been unable to attain product
    liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market.
    Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed
    products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be
    completely self-insured for future product liability losses. In
    addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully
    collect from our insurance carriers in the future.

Segment
    Information

We operate in one significant business segment—human
    pharmaceutical products. Operations of the animal health
    business segment are not material and share many of the same
    economic and operating characteristics as human pharmaceutical
    products. Therefore, they are included with pharmaceutical
    products for purposes of segment reporting.

Net sales are attributed to the countries based on the location
    of the customer.

Our neuroscience group of products includes Zyprexa, Cymbalta,
    Strattera, and Prozac. Endocrinology products consist primarily
    of Humalog, Humulin, Byetta, Actos, Evista, Forteo, and
    Humatrope. Oncology products consist primarily of Alimta and
    Gemzar. Cardiovascular products consist primarily of Cialis,
    ReoPro, Xigris, and Effient. Animal health products include
    Posilac, Tylan, Rumensin, Coban, and other products for
    livestock and poultry, and Comfortis and other products for
    companion animals. The other pharmaceuticals category includes
    anti-infectives, primarily Vancocin and Ceclor, and other
    miscellaneous pharmaceutical products and services.
    Collaboration and other revenue includes our share of the
    U.S. gross margin on Byetta and the global Erbitux royalty.
    See Note 4 for additional information.

Most of our pharmaceutical products are distributed through
    wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other health
    care professionals, and hospitals. In 2009, our three largest
    wholesalers each accounted for between 12 percent and
    17 percent of consolidated total revenue. Further, they
    each accounted for between 9 percent and 16 percent of
    accounts receivable as of December 31, 2009. Animal health
    products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors.

Our business segments are distinguished by the ultimate end user
    of the product: humans or animals. Performance is evaluated
    based on profit or loss from operations before income taxes. The
    accounting policies of the individual segments are substantially
    the same as those described in the summary of significant
    accounting policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements. Income before income taxes for the animal health
    business was approximately $217 million, $192 million,
    and $173 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

The assets of the animal health business are intermixed with
    those of the pharmaceutical products business. Long-lived assets
    disclosed above consist of property and equipment and certain
    sundry assets.

We are exposed to the risk of changes in social, political, and
    economic conditions inherent in foreign operations, and our
    results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are
    affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Our common stock is listed on the New York, London, and Swiss

We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million in 2008, despite
    having a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion. Our net
    loss was driven by the $4.69 billion acquired in-process
    research and development (IPR&D) charge for ImClone in the
    fourth quarter and the $1.48 billion Zyprexa investigation
    settlements recorded in the third quarter. The IPR&D charge
    was not tax deductible, and only a portion of the Zyprexa
    investigation settlements was deductible. In addition, we
    recorded tax expense associated with the ImClone acquisition in
    the fourth quarter in 2008, as well as a discrete income tax
    benefit of $210.3 million in the first quarter of 2008 for
    the resolution of a substantial portion of the

2001-2004

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit.

NM—Not Meaningful


The increase reflects the in-process research and development
    expense of $4.69 billion associated with the ImClone
    acquisition and $1.48 billion associated with the Zyprexa
    investigation settlements.


We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million in 2008, despite
    having a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion. Our net
    loss was driven by the $4.69 billion acquired IPR&D
    charge for ImClone and the $1.48 billion Zyprexa
    investigation settlements. The IPR&D charge was not tax
    deductible, and only a portion of the Zyprexa investigation
    settlements was deductible. In addition, we recorded tax expense
    associated with the ImClone acquisition, as well as a discrete
    income tax benefit of $210.3 million for the resolution of
    a substantial portion of the

2001-2004

IRS audit.


PERFORMANCE
    GRAPH

This graph compares the return on Lilly stock with that of the
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index and our peer
    group for the years 2005 through 2009. The graph assumes that,
    on December 31, 2004, a person invested $100 each in Lilly
    stock, the S&P 500 Stock Index, and the peer group’s
    common stock. The graph measures total shareholder return, which
    takes into account both stock price and dividends. It assumes
    that dividends paid by a company are reinvested in that
    company’s stock.

We constructed the peer group as the industry index for this
    graph. It comprises the ten companies in the pharmaceutical
    industry that we used to benchmark 2009 compensation of
    executive officers: Abbott Laboratories; Amgen Inc.; AstraZeneca
    PLC; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; GlaxoSmithKline plc;
    Johnson & Johnson; Merck & Co., Inc.;
    Novartis AG.; Pfizer Inc.; and Sanofi-Aventis.


Due to changes in the pharmaceutical industry, the peer group
    used to benchmark 2008 compensation of executive officers was
    revised, with the previous peer group consisting of the
    following companies: Abbott Laboratories; Amgen Inc.;
    Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; GlaxoSmithKline plc;
    Johnson & Johnson; Merck & Co., Inc.; Pfizer
    Inc.; Schering-Plough Corporation; and Wyeth. The Peer Group
    (Previous) excludes Schering-Plough Corporation and Wyeth as
    both companies were acquired during 2009.


Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements

ELI
    LILLY AND COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except per-share data)

Note 1:

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation:

The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States (GAAP). The accounts of all

wholly-owned

and majority-owned subsidiaries are included in the consolidated
    financial statements. Where our ownership of consolidated
    subsidiaries is less than 100 percent, the non-controlling
    shareholders’ interests are reflected in shareholders’
    equity. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
    expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial
    statements and during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates. We issued our financial statements
    by filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
    February 22, 2010. We have evaluated subsequent events up
    to the time of the filing.

All per-share amounts, unless otherwise noted in the footnotes,
    are presented on a diluted basis, that is, based on the
    weighted-average number of outstanding common shares plus the
    effect of dilutive stock options and other incremental shares.

Cash equivalents:

We consider all highly
    liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from
    the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The cost of these
    investments approximates fair value.

Inventories:

We state all inventories at the
    lower of cost or market. We use the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of our inventories
    located in the continental United States, or approximately
    40 percent of our total inventories. Other inventories are
    valued by the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method. FIFO cost approximates current
    replacement cost. Inventories at December 31 consisted of the
    following:

Investments:

Substantially all of our
    investments in debt and marketable equity securities are
    classified as

available-for-sale.

Investment securities with maturity dates of less than one year
    from the date of the balance sheet are classified as short-term.

Available-for-sale

securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains
    and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income
    (loss). The credit portion of unrealized losses on our debt
    securities considered to be

other-than-temporary

are recognized in earnings. The remaining portion of the

other-than-temporary

impairment on our debt securities is then recorded in other
    comprehensive income (loss). The entire amount of

other-than-temporary

impairment on our equity securities is recognized in earnings.
    We do not evaluate cost-method investments for impairment unless
    there is an indicator of impairment. We review these investments
    for indicators of impairment on a regular basis. Realized gains
    and losses on sales of

available-for-sale

securities are computed based upon specific identification of
    the initial cost adjusted for any

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value that were recorded in earnings.
    Investments in companies over which we have significant
    influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using
    the equity method with our share of earnings or losses reported
    in other

—

net, expense (income). We own no
    investments that are considered to be trading securities.

Risk-management instruments:

Our derivative
    activities are initiated within the guidelines of documented
    corporate risk-management policies and do not create additional
    risk because gains and losses on derivative contracts offset
    losses and gains on the assets, liabilities, and transactions
    being hedged. As derivative contracts are initiated, we
    designate the instruments individually as either a fair value
    hedge or a cash flow hedge. Management reviews the correlation
    and effectiveness of our derivatives on a quarterly basis.

For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair
    value hedges, the derivative instrument is marked to market with
    gains and losses recognized currently in income to offset the
    respective losses and gains recognized on the underlying
    exposure. For derivative contracts that are designated and
    qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of gains and
    losses on these contracts is reported as a component of other
    comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in
    the same period the hedged


transaction affects earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness is
    immediately recognized in earnings. Derivative contracts that
    are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair
    value with the gain or loss recognized in current earnings
    during the period of change.

We may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts
    to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates
    (principally the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen).
    Foreign currency derivatives used for hedging are put in place
    using the same or like currencies and duration as the underlying
    exposures. Forward contracts are principally used to manage
    exposures arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and
    receivables denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts
    are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in
    other

—

net, expense (income). The purchased option
    contracts are used to hedge anticipated foreign currency
    transactions, primarily intercompany inventory activities
    expected to occur within the next year. These contracts are
    designated as cash flow hedges of those future transactions and
    the impact on earnings is included in cost of sales. We may
    enter into foreign currency forward contracts and currency swaps
    as fair value hedges of firm commitments. Forward and option
    contracts generally have maturities not exceeding 12 months.

In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to
    fluctuations in interest rates. These fluctuations can vary the
    costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a
    portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk
    management that includes the use of derivative financial
    instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to
    limit the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on earnings.
    Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in
    short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to
    manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an
    acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt and
    investment positions and may enter into interest rate swaps or
    collars to help maintain that balance. Interest rate swaps or
    collars that convert our fixed-rate debt or investments to a
    floating rate are designated as fair value hedges of the
    underlying instruments. Interest rate swaps or collars that
    convert floating rate debt or investments to a fixed rate are
    designated as cash flow hedges. Interest expense on the debt is
    adjusted to include the payments made or received under the swap
    agreements.

Goodwill and other intangibles:

Goodwill is
    not amortized. All other intangibles arising from acquisitions
    and research alliances have finite lives and are amortized over
    their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to
    20 years, using the straight-line method. The remaining
    weighted-average amortization period for developed product
    technology is approximately 11 years. Amortization expense
    for 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $277.0 million,
    $193.4 million, and $172.8 million before tax,
    respectively. The estimated amortization expense for each of the
    five succeeding years approximates $280.0 million before
    tax, per year. Substantially all of the amortization expense is
    included in cost of sales. See Note 3 for further
    discussion of goodwill and other intangibles acquired in 2009,
    2008, and 2007.

Goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31 were as
    follows:

Goodwill and net other intangibles are reviewed to assess
    recoverability at least annually and when certain impairment
    indicators are present. No significant impairments occurred with
    respect to the carrying value of our goodwill or other
    intangible assets in 2009, 2008, or 2007.

Property and equipment:

Property and equipment
    is stated on the basis of cost. Provisions for depreciation of
    buildings and equipment are computed generally by the
    straight-line method at rates based on their estimated useful
    lives (12 to 50 years for buildings and 3 to 18 years
    for equipment). We review the carrying value of long-lived
    assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value
    of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is determined by
    comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by
    the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified,
    a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net
    book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.


At December 31, property and equipment consisted of the
    following:

Depreciation expense for 2009, 2008, and 2007 was
    $813.5 million, $731.7 million, and
    $682.3 million, respectively. Interest costs of
    $30.2 million, $48.2 million, and $95.3 million
    were capitalized as part of property and equipment in 2009,
    2008, and 2007, respectively. Total rental expense for all
    leases, including contingent rentals (not material), amounted to
    $337.8 million, $327.4 million, and
    $294.2 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
    Assets under capital leases included in property and equipment
    in the consolidated balance sheets, capital lease obligations
    entered into, and future minimum rental commitments are not
    material.

Litigation and environmental
    liabilities:

Litigation accruals and
    environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance
    recoverables are reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and
    assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. With
    respect to the product liability claims currently asserted
    against us, we have accrued for our estimated exposures to the
    extent they are both probable and estimable based on the
    information available to us. We accrue for certain product
    liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can
    formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate
    these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience
    and data regarding product usage. Legal defense costs expected
    to be incurred in connection with significant product liability
    loss contingencies are accrued when probable and reasonably
    estimable. A portion of the costs associated with defending and
    disposing of these suits is covered by insurance. We record
    receivables for insurance-related recoveries when it is probable
    they will be realized. These receivables are classified as a
    reduction of the litigation charges on the statement of
    operations. We estimate insurance recoverables based on existing
    deductibles, coverage limits, our assessment of any defenses to
    coverage that might be raised by the carriers, and the existing
    and projected future level of insolvencies among the insurance
    carriers. However, for substantially all of our currently
    marketed products, we are completely self-insured for future
    product liability losses.

Revenue recognition:

We recognize revenue from
    sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer
    and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. For
    more than 85 percent of our sales, this is at the time
    products are shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale
    distributor or a major retail chain. The remaining sales are
    recorded at the point of delivery. Provisions for returns,
    discounts, and rebates are established in the same period the
    related sales are recorded.

We also generate income as a result of collaboration agreements.
    Revenue from co-promotion services is based upon net sales
    reported by our co-promotion partners and, if applicable, the
    number of sales calls we perform. Initial fees we receive from
    the partnering of our compounds under development are amortized
    through the expected product approval date. Initial fees
    received from out-licensing agreements that include both the
    sale of marketing rights to our commercialized products and a
    related commitment to supply the products are generally
    recognized in net product sales over the term of the supply
    agreement. We immediately recognize the full amount of
    developmental milestone payments due to us upon the achievement
    of the milestone event if the event is substantive, objectively
    determinable, and represents an important point in the
    development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product. Milestone
    payments earned by us are generally recorded in
    other

—

net, expense (income). If the payment to us is
    a commercialization payment that is part of a multiple-element
    collaborative commercialization arrangement and is a result of
    the initiation of the commercialization period (e.g., payments
    triggered by regulatory approval for marketing or launch of the
    product), we amortize the payment to income as we perform under
    the terms of the arrangement.

Royalty revenue from licensees, which are based on third-party
    sales of licensed products and technology, are recorded as
    earned in accordance with the contract terms when third-party
    sales can be reasonably measured and collection of the funds is
    reasonably assured. This royalty revenue is included in
    collaboration and other revenue.


Following is the composition of revenue:

Acquired research and development:

We
    recognize as incurred the cost of directly acquiring assets to
    be used in the research and development process that have not
    yet received regulatory approval for marketing and for which no
    alternative future use has been identified. Beginning in 2009,
    in process research and development acquired in a business
    combination is capitalized at the fair value as of the time of
    the acquisition. For in-process research and development assets
    acquired in both direct acquisitions and business combinations,
    once the product has obtained regulatory approval, we capitalize
    any milestones paid and amortize them over the period benefited.
    Milestones paid prior to regulatory approval of the product are
    generally expensed when the event requiring payment of the
    milestone occurs.

Income taxes:

Deferred taxes are recognized
    for the future tax effects of temporary differences between
    financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and
    rates. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the
    income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted
    to the United States and be taxable.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only
    if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the
    technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
    the financial statements from such a position are measured based
    on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent
    likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

Earnings per share:

We calculate basic
    earnings per share based on the weighted-average number of
    outstanding common shares and incremental shares. We calculate
    diluted earnings per share based on the weighted-average number
    of outstanding common shares plus the effect of dilutive stock
    options and other incremental shares. See Note 11 for
    further discussion.

Stock-based compensation:

We recognize the
    fair value of stock-based compensation as expense over the
    requisite service period of the individual grantees, which
    generally equals the vesting period. Under our policy all
    stock-based awards are approved prior to the date of grant. The
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approves the
    value of the award and date of grant. Stock-based compensation
    that is awarded as part of our annual equity grant is made on a
    specific grant date scheduled in advance.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications
    have been made to the December 31, 2008 and 2007
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to
    conform with the December 31, 2009 presentation.

Note 2:  Implementation
    of New Financial Accounting Pronouncements

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement on
    Business Combinations was effective for us for business
    combinations with the acquisition date on or after
    January 1, 2009. This Statement, with its amendment,
    changes the way in which the acquisition method is to be applied
    in a business combination. The primary revisions require an
    acquirer in a business combination to measure assets acquired,
    liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
    acquiree at the acquisition date, at their fair values as of
    that date, with limited exceptions specified in the Statement.
    This Statement also requires the acquirer in a business
    combination achieved in stages to recognize the identifiable
    assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest
    in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values (or
    other amounts determined in accordance with the Statement).
    Assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from
    contingencies are to be measured at fair value if it can be
    determined during the measurement period. If fair value cannot
    be determined, the asset or liability should be recognized at
    the acquisition date if it is probable that an asset existed or
    a liability had been incurred and the amount can be reasonably
    estimated. This Statement significantly amends other
    authoritative guidance on Business


Combinations as well, and now requires the capitalization of
    research and development assets acquired in a business
    combination at their acquisition-date fair values, separately
    from goodwill. The accounting for income taxes was also amended
    by this Statement to require the acquirer to recognize changes
    in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable
    because of a business combination either in income from
    continuing operations in the period of the combination or
    directly in contributed capital, depending on the circumstances.

We adopted the provisions of the FASB Statement on
    Consolidations relating to the accounting for noncontrolling
    interests on January 1, 2009. This Statement amends
    previous authoritative guidance, by requiring companies to
    report a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary as equity in
    its consolidated financial statements. Disclosure of the amounts
    of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the
    noncontrolling interest will be required. This Statement also
    clarifies that transactions that result in a change in a
    parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not
    result in deconsolidation will be treated as equity
    transactions, while a gain or loss will be recognized by the
    parent when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. We now classify our
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary as part of
    shareholders’ equity in our consolidated statements of
    financial position at December 31, 2009 and reclassified
    the December 31, 2008 balances accordingly. The net income
    attributed to the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary for
    2009 and 2008 is not material and is included in

other-net,

expense (income).

We adopted the provisions of the FASB Statement on disclosures
    relating to Derivatives and Hedging on January 1, 2009.
    This Statement requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures
    about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted
    for, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    affect an entity’s financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows. These disclosures are included in
    Note 6.

We adopted the provisions of the Emerging Issues Task Force
    (EITF) guidance related to Collaborative Arrangements on
    January 1, 2009. This guidance defines collaborative
    arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for
    transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement
    and between participants in the arrangement and third parties.
    This guidance has been applied retrospectively to all prior
    periods presented for significant collaborative arrangements
    existing as of the effective date by classifying revenues into
    two separate components: net product sales and collaboration and
    other revenue. See Note 4 for additional information.

We adopted the provisions of the FASB Staff Position (FSP)
    relating to Investments on January 1, 2009. This FSP amends
    the

other-than-temporary

recognition guidance for debt securities and requires additional
    interim and annual disclosures of

other-than-temporary

impairments on debt and equity securities. Pursuant to the new
    guidance, an

other-than-temporary

impairment has occurred if a company does not expect to recover
    the entire amortized cost basis of the security. In this
    situation, if the company does not intend to sell the impaired
    security, and it is not more likely than not it will be required
    to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost
    basis, the amount of the

other-than-temporary

impairment recognized in earnings is limited to the portion
    attributed to the credit loss. The remaining portion of the

other-than-temporary

impairment is then recorded in other comprehensive income
    (loss). This FSP has been applied to existing and new securities
    as of January 1, 2009. The applicable disclosures are
    included in Note 6. The implementation of this FSP was not
    material to our consolidated financial position or results of
    operations and there was no cumulative effect adjustment.

We adopted the provisions of a FSP relating to Fair Value
    Measurements and Disclosures, as of March 31, 2009. This
    FSP provides additional guidance on estimating fair value when
    the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have
    significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity.
    The FSP also provides additional guidance on circumstances that
    may indicate that a transaction is not orderly and requires
    additional disclosures. The implementation of this FSP had no
    effect on our consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

We adopted the provisions of a FSP on Financial Instruments, as
    of March 31, 2009. This FSP required disclosures about fair
    value of all financial instruments for interim reporting
    periods. The implementation of this FSP had no effect on our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

We adopted the provisions of a FSP on
    Compensation—Retirement Benefits, as of December 31,
    2009. This FSP required disclosures about plan assets of a
    defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The
    applicable disclosures are included in Note 13. The
    implementation of this FSP had no effect on our consolidated
    financial position or results of operations.

During 2009, we adopted the provisions of the FASB Statement on
    Subsequent Events. This Statement provides authoritative
    accounting literature and disclosure requirements for material
    events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date and prior
    to the issuance of the financial statements. The implementation
    of this Statement had no effect on our consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.


In 2009, the FASB issued a Statement on Transfers and Servicing,
    an amendment of previous authoritative guidance. The most
    significant amendments resulting from this Statement consist of
    the removal of the concept of a qualifying special-purpose
    entity (SPE) from previous authoritative guidance, and the
    elimination of the exception for qualifying SPEs from the
    Consolidation guidance regarding variable interest entities.
    This Statement is effective for us January 1, 2010 and is
    not expected to be material to our consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

In 2009, the FASB issued a Statement which amends the previous
    Consolidations guidance regarding variable interest entities and
    addresses the effects of eliminating the qualifying SPE concept
    from the guidance on Transfers and Servicing. This Statement
    responds to concerns about the application of certain key
    provisions of the previous guidance on Consolidations regarding
    variable interest entities, including concerns over the
    transparency of enterprises’ involvement with variable
    interest entities. This Statement is effective for us
    January 1, 2010 and is not expected to be material to our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In 2009, the FASB ratified EITF guidance related to Revenue
    Recognition that amends the previous guidance on arrangements
    with multiple deliverables. This guidance provides principles
    and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist,
    how the arrangements should be separated, and how the
    consideration should be allocated. It also clarifies the method
    to allocate revenue in an arrangement using the estimated
    selling price. This guidance is effective for us January 1,
    2011 and is not expected to be material to our consolidated
    financial position or results of operations.

Note 3:  Acquisitions

During 2008 and 2007 we acquired several businesses. These
    acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations under
    the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method of
    accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were
    recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition
    date in our consolidated financial statements. The determination
    of estimated fair value required management to make significant
    estimates and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over
    the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, has
    been recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these
    acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial
    statements from the date of acquisition.

Most of these acquisitions included IPR&D, which
    represented compounds, new indications, or line extensions under
    development that had not yet achieved regulatory approval for
    marketing. There are several methods that can be used to
    determine the estimated fair value of the IPR&D acquired in
    a business combination. We utilized the “income
    method”, which applies a probability weighting to the
    estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected
    sales revenues and estimated costs. These projections are based
    on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection,
    historical pricing of similar products, and expected industry
    trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted
    to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. This
    analysis is performed for each project independently. Pursuant
    to the existing rules, these acquired IPR&D intangible
    assets totaling $4.71 billion and $340.5 million in
    2008 and 2007, respectively, were expensed immediately
    subsequent to the acquisition because the products had no
    alternative future use. The ongoing expenses with respect to
    each of these products in development are not material to our
    total research and development expense currently and are not
    expected to be material to our total research and development
    expense on an annual basis in the future.

In addition to the acquisitions of businesses, we also acquired
    several products in development. The acquired IPR&D related
    to these products of $90.0 million, $122.0 million,
    and $405.1 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively,
    was also written off by a charge to income immediately upon
    acquisition because the products had no alternative future use.

ImClone
    Acquisition

On November 24, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding
    shares of ImClone Systems Inc. (ImClone), a biopharmaceutical
    company focused on advancing oncology care, for a total purchase
    price of approximately $6.5 billion, which was financed
    through borrowings. This strategic combination offered both
    targeted therapies and oncolytic agents along with a pipeline
    spanning all phases of clinical development. The combination
    also expanded our biotechnology capabilities.

The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination
    under the purchase method of accounting, resulting in goodwill
    of $425.9 million. No portion of this goodwill was or is
    expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

All of the estimated fair value of the acquired IPR&D was
    attributable to oncology-related products in development,
    including $1.33 billion to line extensions for Erbitux. A
    significant portion (81 percent) of the remaining value of
    acquired IPR&D was attributable to ramucirumab,
    necitumumab, and cixutumumab. At the time of the acquisition,
    ramucirumab was in Phase III clinical testing, while
    necitumumab and cixutumumab were in Phase II clinical
    testing. The discount rate we used in valuing the acquired
    IPR&D projects was 13.5 percent, and the charge for
    acquired IPR&D of $4.69 billion recorded in the fourth
    quarter of 2008 was not deductible for tax purposes.

Pro Forma
    Financial Information (unaudited)

The following pro forma financial information presents the
    combined results of our operations with ImClone as if the
    acquisition and the financing for the acquisition had occurred
    as of the beginning of each of the years presented. We have
    adjusted the historical consolidated financial information to
    give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable
    to the acquisition. The pro forma financial information is not
    necessarily indicative of what our consolidated results of
    operations actually would have been had we completed the
    acquisition at the beginning of each year. In addition, the pro
    forma financial information does not attempt to project the
    future results of operations of our combined company.

The pro forma financial information above excludes the
    non-recurring charge incurred for acquired IPR&D of
    $4.69 billion and other merger-related costs.

The pro forma financial information above reflects the following:

•

a reduction of the amortization of ImClone’s deferred
    income of $86.2 million (2008) and $98.4 million
    (2007);

•

the increase of amortization expense of $78.8 million in
    2008 and 2007 related to the estimated fair value of
    identifiable intangible assets from the purchase price
    allocation which are being amortized over their estimated useful
    lives through 2023 in the U.S. and through 2018 in the rest
    of the world. The change in depreciation expense related to the
    change in the estimated fair value of property and equipment
    from the book value at the time of the acquisition was not
    material;

•

the adjustment to increase interest expense related to the debt
    incurred to finance the acquisition and the adjustment to
    decrease interest income related to the lost interest income on
    the cash used to purchase ImClone by a total of
    $301.0 million in 2008 and 2007;


•

the reduction of ImClone’s income tax expense to provide
    for income taxes at the statutory tax rate and the adjustment to
    income taxes for pro forma adjustments at the statutory tax
    rate, totaling $139.3 million (2008) and
    $189.5 million (2007). This excludes the acquired
    IPR&D charge of $4.69 billion, which was not tax
    deductible;

•

certain reclassifications to conform to accounting policies and
    classifications that are consistent with our practices (e.g.,
    ImClone’s license fees and milestones were classified as
    other—net, expense (income), rather than net sales).

Posilac

On October 1, 2008, we acquired the worldwide rights to the
    dairy cow supplement Posilac, as well as the product’s
    supporting operations, from Monsanto Company (Monsanto). The
    acquisition of Posilac provides us with a product that
    complements those of our animal health business. Under the terms
    of the agreement, we acquired the rights to the Posilac brand,
    as well as the product’s U.S. sales force and
    manufacturing facility, for an aggregate purchase price of
    $403.9 million, which included a $300.0 million
    upfront payment, transaction costs, and an accrual for
    contingent consideration to Monsanto based on estimated future
    Posilac sales for which payment is considered likely beyond a
    reasonable doubt.

This acquisition has been accounted for as a business
    combination under the purchase method of accounting. We
    allocated $204.3 million to identifiable intangible assets
    related to Posilac, $167.6 million to inventories, and
    $99.5 million of the purchase price to property and
    equipment. We also assumed $67.5 million of liabilities.
    Substantially all of the identifiable intangible assets are
    being amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives of
    20 years. The amount allocated to each of the intangible
    assets acquired is deductible for tax purposes.

SGX
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

On August 20, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock of SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SGX), a collaboration
    partner since 2003. The acquisition allows us to integrate
    SGX’s structure-guided drug discovery platform into our
    drug discovery efforts. It also gives us access to
    FAST

tm

,

    SGX’s fragment-based, protein structure guided drug
    discovery technology, and to a portfolio of preclinical oncology
    compounds focused on a number of kinase targets. Under the terms
    of the agreement, the outstanding shares of SGX common stock
    were redeemed for an aggregate purchase price of
    $66.8 million.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination
    under the purchase method of accounting. We allocated
    $29.6 million of the purchase price to deferred tax assets
    and $28.0 million to acquired IPR&D. The acquired
    IPR&D charge of $28.0 million was recorded in the
    third quarter of 2008 and was not deductible for tax purposes.

ICOS
    Corporation

On January 29, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock of ICOS Corporation (ICOS), our partner in the
    Lilly ICOS LLC joint venture for the manufacture and sale of
    Cialis for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The
    acquisition brought the full value of Cialis to us and enabled
    us to realize operational efficiencies in the further
    development, marketing, and selling of this product. The
    aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion
    was financed through borrowings.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination
    under the purchase method of accounting, resulting in goodwill
    of $646.7 million. No portion of this goodwill is expected
    to be deductible for tax purposes.

The other significant components of the purchase price
    allocation were developed product technology (Cialis) of
    $1,659.9 million, the tax benefit of net operating losses
    of $404.1 million, acquired IPR&D of
    $303.5 million, cash and short-term investments of
    $197.7 million, deferred tax liability of
    $583.5 million and long-term debt assumed of
    $275.6 million. The developed product technology is being
    amortized over the remaining expected patent lives of Cialis in
    each country; patent expiration dates range from 2015 to 2017.

Other
    Acquisitions

During the second quarter of 2007, we acquired all of the
    outstanding stock of both Hypnion, Inc. (Hypnion), a privately
    held neuroscience drug discovery company focused on sleep
    disorders, and Ivy Animal Health, Inc. (Ivy), a privately held
    applied research and pharmaceutical product development company
    focused on the animal health industry, for $445.0 million
    in cash.

The acquisition of Hypnion provided us with a broader and more
    substantive presence in the area of sleep disorder research and
    ownership of LY2624803, a novel Phase II compound with a
    dual mechanism of action aimed at promoting better sleep onset
    and sleep maintenance. This was Hypnion’s only significant
    asset. For this acquisition, we recorded an acquired IPR&D
    charge of $291.1 million, which was not deductible for tax
    purposes. Because Hypnion was a development-stage company, the
    transaction was


accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than as a
    business combination and, therefore, goodwill was not recorded.

The acquisition of Ivy provided us with products that complement
    those of our animal health business. This acquisition has been
    accounted for as a business combination under the purchase
    method of accounting. We allocated $88.7 million of the
    purchase price to other identifiable intangible assets,
    primarily related to marketed products, $37.0 million to
    acquired IPR&D, and $25.0 million to goodwill. The
    other identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over
    their estimated remaining useful lives of 10 to 20 years.
    The $37.0 million allocated to acquired IPR&D was
    charged to expense in the second quarter of 2007. Goodwill
    resulting from this acquisition was fully allocated to the
    animal health business segment. The amount allocated to each of
    the intangible assets acquired, including goodwill of
    $25.0 million and the acquired IPR&D of
    $37.0 million, was deductible for tax purposes.

Product
    Acquisitions

In December 2009, we entered into a licensing and collaboration
    agreement with Incyte Corporation to acquire rights to its
    compound, and certain follow-on compounds, for the treatment of
    inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The lead compound was in
    the development stage (Phase II clinical trials for
    rheumatoid arthritis) and had no alternative future use. As with
    many development-phase compounds, launch of the product, if
    approved, was not expected in the near term. The charge of
    $90.0 million for acquired IPR&D related to this
    arrangement was included in expense in the fourth quarter of
    2009 and is deductible for tax purposes. As part of this
    agreement, Incyte has the option to co-develop these compounds
    and the option to co-promote in the United States.

In June 2008, we entered into a licensing and development
    agreement with TransPharma Medical Ltd. (TransPharma) to acquire
    rights to its product and related drug delivery system for the
    treatment of osteoporosis. The product, which is administered
    transdermally using TransPharma’s proprietary technology,
    was in Phase II clinical testing, and had no alternative
    future use. Under the arrangement, we also gained non-exclusive
    access to TransPharma’s ViaDerm drug delivery system for
    the product. As with many development-phase products, launch of
    the product, if approved, was not expected in the near term. The
    charge of $35.0 million for acquired IPR&D related to
    this arrangement was included as expense in the second quarter
    of 2008 and is deductible for tax purposes.

In January 2008, our agreement with BioMS Medical Corp. to
    acquire the rights to its compound for the treatment of multiple
    sclerosis became effective. At the inception of this agreement,
    this compound was in the development stage (Phase III
    clinical trials) and had no alternative future use. As with many
    development-phase compounds, launch of the product, if approved,
    was not expected in the near term. In the third quarter of 2009,
    data from the Phase III clinical trials showed there were
    no statistically significant differences between dirucotide and
    placebo on the primary or secondary endpoints of the study, and
    ongoing clinical trials and the arrangement were discontinued.
    The charge of $87.0 million for acquired IPR&D related
    to this arrangement was included as expense in the first quarter
    of 2008 and is deductible for tax purposes.

In October 2007, we entered into an agreement with Glenmark
    Pharmaceuticals Limited India to acquire the rights to a
    portfolio of transient receptor potential vanilloid

sub-family

    (TRPV1) antagonist molecules, including a clinical-phase
    compound. The compound was in early clinical phase development
    as a potential next-generation treatment for various pain
    conditions, including osteoarthritic pain, and had no
    alternative future use. As with many development-phase
    compounds, launch of the product, if approved, was not expected
    in the near term. The charge of $45.0 million for acquired
    IPR&D was deductible for tax purposes and was included as
    expense in the fourth quarter of 2007. Development of this
    compound has been suspended.

In October 2007, we entered into a global strategic alliance
    with MacroGenics, Inc. (MacroGenics) to develop and
    commercialize teplizumab, a humanized anti-CD3 monoclonal
    antibody, as well as other potential next-generation anti-CD3
    molecules for use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. As
    part of the arrangement, we acquired the exclusive rights to the
    molecule, which was in the development stage (Phase II/III
    clinical trial for individuals with recent-onset type 1
    diabetes) and had no alternative future use. As with many
    development-phase compounds, launch of the product, if approved,
    was not expected in the near term. The charge of
    $44.0 million for acquired IPR&D was deductible for
    tax purposes and was included as expense in the fourth quarter
    of 2007.

In January 2007, we entered into an agreement with OSI
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to acquire the rights to its compound for
    the treatment of type 2 diabetes. At the inception of this
    agreement, this compound was in the development stage (Phase I
    clinical trials) and had no alternative future use. As with many
    development-phase compounds, launch of the product, if approved,
    was not expected in the near term. The charge of
    $25.0 million for acquired IPR&D related to this
    arrangement was included as expense in the first quarter of 2007
    and was deductible for tax purposes.


In connection with these arrangements, our partners are
    generally entitled to future milestones and royalties based on
    sales should these products be approved for commercialization.

Note 4:  Collaborations

We often enter into collaborative arrangements to develop and
    commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities might
    include research and development, marketing and selling
    (including promotional activities and physician detailing),
    manufacturing, and distribution. These collaborations often
    require milestone and royalty or profit share payments,
    contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked
    to the success of the asset in development, as well as expense
    reimbursements or payments to the third party. Revenues related
    to products sold by us pursuant to these arrangements are
    included in net product sales, while other sources of revenue
    (e.g., royalties and profit share payments) are included in
    collaboration and other revenue. Operating expenses for costs
    incurred pursuant to these arrangements are reported in their
    respective expense line item, net of any payments made to or
    reimbursements received from our collaboration partners. Each
    collaboration is unique in nature, and our more significant
    arrangements are discussed below.

Erbitux

Prior to our acquisition in November 2008, ImClone entered into
    several collaborations with respect to Erbitux, a product
    approved to fight cancer, while still in its development phase.
    The most significant collaborations operate in these geographic
    territories: the U.S., Japan, and Canada (Bristol-Myers Squibb
    Company); and worldwide except the U.S. and Canada (Merck
    KGaA). The agreements are expected to expire in 2018, upon which
    all of the rights with respect to Erbitux in the U.S. and
    Canada return to us. The following table summarizes the revenue
    recognized with respect to Erbitux:

Bristol-Myers
    Squibb Company

Pursuant to a commercial agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb
    Company and E.R. Squibb (collectively, BMS), relating to
    Erbitux, ImClone is co-developing and co-promoting Erbitux in
    the U.S. and Canada with BMS, exclusively, and in Japan
    with BMS and Merck KGaA. The companies have jointly agreed to
    expand the investment in the ongoing clinical development plan
    for Erbitux to further explore its use in additional tumor
    types. Under this arrangement, Erbitux research and development
    and other costs, up to threshold amounts, are the sole
    responsibility of BMS, with costs in excess of the thresholds
    shared by both companies according to a predetermined ratio.

Responsibilities associated with clinical and other ongoing
    studies are apportioned between the parties as determined
    pursuant to the agreement. Collaborative reimbursements received
    by ImClone for supply of clinical trial materials; for research
    and development; and for a portion of marketing, selling, and
    administrative expenses are recorded as a reduction to the
    respective expense line items on the consolidated statement of
    operations. We receive a distribution fee in the form of a
    royalty from BMS, based on a percentage of net sales in the
    U.S. and Canada, which is recorded in collaboration and
    other revenue. Royalty expense paid to third parties, net of any
    reimbursements received, is recorded as a reduction of
    collaboration and other revenue.

We are responsible for the manufacture and supply of all
    requirements of Erbitux in bulk-form active pharmaceutical
    ingredient (API) for clinical and commercial use in the
    territory, and BMS will purchase all of its requirements of API
    for commercial use from us, subject to certain stipulations per
    the agreement. Sales of Erbitux to BMS for commercial use are
    reported in net product sales.

Merck
    KGaA

A development and license agreement between ImClone and Merck
    KGaA (Merck) with respect to Erbitux granted Merck exclusive
    rights to market Erbitux outside of the U.S. and Canada,
    and co-exclusive rights with BMS and ImClone in Japan. Merck
    also has rights to manufacture Erbitux for supply in its
    territory. We manufacture and provide a portion of Merck’s
    requirements for API, which is included in net product sales. We
    also receive a royalty on the sales of Erbitux outside of the
    U.S. and Canada, which is included in collaboration and
    other revenue as earned. Collaborative reimbursements received
    for supply of product; for research and development; and
    marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are recorded as
    a reduction to the respective expense line items on the
    consolidated statement of operations. Royalty


expense paid to third parties, net of any royalty reimbursements
    received, is recorded as a reduction of collaboration and other
    revenue.

Necitumumab

In January 2010, we restructured the collaboration agreement
    executed by ImClone and BMS in 2001 to allow for the
    co-development and co-commercialization of necitumumab, which is
    currently in Phase III clinical testing for non-small cell
    lung cancer. Within this restructured arrangement, we and BMS
    have agreed to share in the cost of developing and potentially
    commercializing necitumumab in the U.S., Canada, and Japan. We
    maintain exclusive rights to necitumumab in all other markets.
    We will fund 45 percent of the development costs for
    studies that will be used only in the U.S., and 72.5 percent for
    global studies. We will be responsible for the manufacturing of
    API and BMS will be responsible for manufacturing the finished
    product. We could receive a payment of $250.0 million upon
    approval in the U.S. In the U.S. and Canada, BMS will
    record sales and we will receive 45 percent of the profits for
    necitumumab, while we will provide 50 percent of the selling
    effort. In Japan, we and BMS will share costs and profits evenly.

Exenatide

We are in a collaborative arrangement with Amylin
    Pharmaceuticals (Amylin) for the joint development, marketing,
    and selling of Byetta (exenatide injection) and other forms of
    exenatide such as exenatide once weekly. Byetta is presently
    approved as an adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in
    patients with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved adequate
    glycemic control using metformin, a sulfonylurea or a
    combination of metformin and sulfonylurea; and in the U.S. only,
    using a thiazolidinedione (with or without metformin) and as a
    monotherapy. Lilly and Amylin are co-promoting exenatide in the
    U.S. Amylin is responsible for manufacturing and primarily
    utilizes third-party contract manufacturers to supply Byetta.
    However, we are manufacturing Byetta pen delivery devices for
    Amylin. We are responsible for development and commercialization
    costs outside the U.S.

Under the terms of our arrangement, we report as collaboration
    and other revenue our 50 percent share of gross margin on
    Amylin’s net product sales in the U.S. We report as
    net product sales 100 percent of sales outside the
    U.S. and our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to
    Amylin. The following table summarizes the revenue recognized
    with respect to Byetta:

We pay Amylin a percentage of the gross margin of exenatide
    sales outside of the U.S., and these costs are recorded in cost
    of sales. Under the

50/50

profit-sharing arrangement for the U.S., in addition to
    recording as revenue our 50 percent share of
    exenatide’s gross margin, we also report 50 percent of
    U.S. research and development costs and marketing and
    selling costs in the respective line items on the consolidated
    statements of operations.

A New Drug Application has been submitted to the U.S. Food
    and Drug Administration (FDA) for exenatide once weekly. Amylin
    is constructing and will operate a manufacturing facility for
    exenatide once weekly, and we have entered into a supply
    agreement in which Amylin will supply exenatide once weekly
    product to us for sales outside the U.S. The estimated
    total cost of the facility is approximately $550 million.
    In 2008, we paid $125.0 million to Amylin, which we will
    amortize to cost of sales over the estimated life of the supply
    agreement beginning with product launch. We would be required to
    reimburse Amylin for a portion of any future impairment of this
    facility, recognized in accordance with GAAP. A portion of the
    $125.0 million payment we made to Amylin would be
    creditable against any amount we would owe as a result of
    impairment. We have also agreed to loan up to
    $165.0 million to Amylin at an indexed rate beginning
    December 1, 2009; no amounts were loaned in 2009 and any
    borrowings have to be repaid by June 30, 2014. We have also
    agreed to cooperate with Amylin in the development,
    manufacturing, and marketing of exenatide once weekly in a
    dual-chamber cartridge pen configuration. We will contribute
    60 percent of the total initial capital costs of the
    project, our portion of which will be approximately
    $130 million, of which we have contributed approximately
    $50 million as of December 31, 2009.

Cymbalta

Boehringer
    Ingelheim

We are in a collaborative arrangement with Boehringer Ingelheim
    (BI) to jointly market and promote Cymbalta, a product for the
    treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral
    neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and
    fibromyalgia, outside the U.S. Pursuant to the terms of the
    agreement, we generally share equally in development, marketing,
    and selling expenses, and pay BI a commission on


sales in the co-promotion territories. We manufacture the
    product for all territories. Reimbursements or payments for the
    cost sharing of marketing, selling, and administrative expenses
    are recorded in the respective expense line items in the
    consolidated statements of operations. The commission paid to BI
    is recognized in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses.

Quintiles

We were in a collaborative arrangement with Quintiles
    Transnational Corp. (Quintiles) to jointly market and promote
    Cymbalta in the U.S. since Cymbalta’s launch in 2004.
    Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Quintiles shared in the
    costs to co-promote Cymbalta with us and receives a commission
    based upon net product sales. According to that agreement,
    Quintiles’ obligation to promote Cymbalta expired during
    2009, and we will pay a lower rate on net product sales for
    three years after completion of the promotion efforts specified
    in that agreement. The commissions paid to Quintiles are
    recorded in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses.

Effient

We are in a collaborative arrangement with Daiichi Sankyo
    Company, Limited (D-S) to develop, market, and promote Effient,
    an antiplatelet agent for the treatment of patients with acute
    coronary syndromes (ACS) who are being managed with an
    artery-opening procedure known as percutaneous coronary
    intervention (PCI). The product was approved for marketing by
    the European Commission under the tradename Efient in February
    2009, and the initial sales were recorded in the first quarter
    of 2009. The product was also approved for marketing by the FDA
    under the tradename Effient in July 2009, and the initial sales
    in the U.S. were recorded in the third quarter. Within this
    arrangement, we and D-S have agreed to co-promote under the same
    trademark in certain territories (including the U.S. and
    five major European markets), while we have exclusive marketing
    rights in certain other territories. D-S has exclusive marketing
    rights in Japan. Under the agreement, we paid D-S an upfront
    license fee and agreed to pay future success milestones. The
    parties share approximately

50/50

in the
    profits, as well as in the costs of development and marketing in
    the co-promotion territories. A third party manufactures bulk
    product, and we produce the finished product for our exclusive
    and co-promotion territories. We record product sales in our
    exclusive and co-promotion territories. In our exclusive
    territories, we will pay D-S a royalty specific to these
    territories. Profit share payments made to D-S are recorded as
    marketing, selling, and administrative expenses. All royalties
    paid to D-S and the third-party manufacturer are recorded in
    cost of sales. Worldwide Effient sales were $27.0 million
    in 2009. The product is in the early phases of launch in both
    the U.S. and Europe.

TPG-Axon
    Capital

In 2008, we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of
    TPG-Axon Capital (TPG) for the Phase III development of a
    gamma-secretase inhibitor and an A-beta antibody, our two lead
    molecules for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s
    disease. Under the agreement, both we and TPG will provide
    funding for the Alzheimer’s clinical trials. Funding from
    TPG will not exceed $325 million and could extend into
    2014. In exchange for their funding, TPG may receive
    success-based milestones totaling $330 million and mid- to
    high-single digit royalties that are contingent upon the
    successful development of the Alzheimer’s treatments. The
    royalties will be paid for approximately eight years after
    launch of a product. Reimbursements received from TPG for its
    portion of research and development costs incurred related to
    the Alzheimer’s treatments are recorded as a reduction to
    the research and development expense line item on the
    consolidated statements of operations. The reimbursement from
    TPG is not expected to be material in any period.

Summary of Collaboration Related Commission and Profit Share
    Payments

The aggregate amount of commission and profit share payments
    included in marketing, selling, and administrative expense
    pursuant to the collaborations described above was
    $319.2 million, $307.6 million, and
    $217.5 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Note 5:  Asset
    Impairments, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges

The components of the charges included in asset impairments,
    restructuring, and other special charges in our consolidated
    statements of operations are described below.

Asset Impairments
    and Related Restructuring and Other Charges

Asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of
    $37.9 million were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2009
    as a result of our announced initiatives to reduce our cost
    structure and global workforce. These charges relate to
    severance costs which are expected to be paid in the first half
    of 2010.

We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other
    special charges of $424.8 million in the third quarter of
    2009 primarily due to the sale of our Tippecanoe Laboratories
    manufacturing site to an affiliate


of Evonik Industries AG (Evonik) in early 2010. In connection
    with the sale of the site, we entered into a nine-year supply
    and services agreement, whereby Evonik will manufacture final
    and intermediate step active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for
    certain of our human and animal health products. The decision to
    sell the site was based upon a projected decline in utilization
    of the site due to several factors, including upcoming patent
    expirations on certain medicines made at the site; our strategic
    decision to purchase, rather than manufacture, many late-stage
    chemical intermediates; and the evolution of our pipeline toward
    more biotechnology medicines. In addition to the sale of the
    Tippecanoe site, in the third quarter of 2009 we announced a
    voluntary exit program for certain U.S. sales employees.
    Components of the third-quarter restructuring charge include
    non-cash asset impairment charges and other charges of
    $363.7 million, and $61.1 million in severance related
    charges, substantially all of which is expected to be paid in
    cash by early 2010. The fair value of assets used in determining
    impairment charges was based on contracted sales prices.

We incurred asset impairments, restructuring, and other special
    charges of $80.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
    These charges were the result of decisions approved by
    management in the fourth quarter as well as previously announced
    strategic decisions. The primary components of this charge
    include non-cash asset impairments of $35.1 million for the
    write down of impaired assets, all of which have no future use,
    and other charges of $44.9 million, primarily related to
    severance and environmental cleanup charges in connection with
    previously announced strategic decisions made in prior periods.
    Substantially all of these costs were paid during 2009.

Further, in the third quarter of 2008, as a result of our
    previously announced agreements with Covance Inc. (Covance),
    Quintiles Transnational Corp. (Quintiles), and Ingenix
    Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., doing business as i3 Statprobe
    (i3), and as part of our efforts to transform into a more
    flexible organization, we recognized asset impairments,
    restructuring, and other special charges of $182.4 million.
    We sold our Greenfield, Indiana site to Covance, a global drug
    development services firm, and entered into a

10-year

service agreement under which Covance will provide preclinical
    toxicology work and perform additional clinical trials for us as
    well as operate the site to meet our needs and those of other
    pharmaceutical industry clients. In addition, we signed
    agreements with Quintiles for clinical trial monitoring services
    and with i3 for clinical data management services. Components of
    the third-quarter restructuring charge include non-cash charges
    of $148.3 million primarily related to the loss on sale of
    assets sold to Covance, severance costs of $27.8 million,
    and exit costs of $6.3 million. Substantially all of these
    costs were paid in 2008.

In the second quarter of 2008, we recognized restructuring and
    other special charges of $88.9 million. In addition, we
    recognized non-cash charges of $57.1 million for the write
    down of impaired manufacturing assets that had no future use,
    which were included in cost of sales. In April 2008, we
    announced a voluntary exit program that was offered to employees
    primarily in manufacturing. Components of the second-quarter
    restructuring charge include total severance costs of
    $53.5 million related to these programs and
    $35.4 million related to exit costs incurred during the
    second quarter in connection with previously announced strategic
    decisions made in prior periods. Substantially all of these
    costs were paid by the end of July 2008.

In March 2008, we terminated development of our AIR Insulin
    program, which was being conducted in collaboration with
    Alkermes, Inc. The program had been in Phase III clinical
    development as a potential treatment for type 1 and
    type 2 diabetes. This decision was not a result of any
    observations during AIR Insulin trials relating to the safety of
    the product, but rather was a result of increasing uncertainties
    in the regulatory environment, and a thorough evaluation of the
    evolving commercial and clinical potential of the product
    compared to existing medical therapies. As a result of this
    decision, we halted our ongoing clinical studies and
    transitioned the AIR Insulin patients in these studies to other
    appropriate therapies. We implemented a patient program in the
    U.S., and other regions of the world where allowed, to provide
    clinical trial participants with appropriate financial support
    to fund their medications and diagnostic supplies through the
    end of 2008.

We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other
    special charges of $145.7 million in the first quarter of
    2008. These charges were primarily related to the decision to
    terminate development of AIR Insulin. Components of these
    charges included non-cash charges of $40.9 million for the
    write down of impaired manufacturing assets that had no use
    beyond the AIR Insulin program, as well as charges of
    $91.7 million for estimated contractual obligations and
    wind-down costs associated with the termination of clinical
    trials and certain development activities, and costs associated
    with the patient program to transition participants from AIR
    Insulin. This amount includes an estimate of Alkermes’
    wind-down costs for which we were contractually obligated. The
    wind-down activities and patient programs were substantially
    complete by the end of 2008. The remaining component of these
    charges, $13.1 million, is related to exit costs incurred
    in the first quarter of 2008 in connection with previously
    announced strategic decisions made in prior periods.


We incurred asset impairments, restructuring, and other special
    charges of $67.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
    These charges were a result of decisions approved by management
    in the fourth quarter as well as previously announced strategic
    decisions. Components of this charge include non-cash charges of
    $42.5 million for the write down of impaired assets, all of
    which have no future use, and other charges of
    $25.1 million, primarily related to additional severance
    and environmental cleanup charges related to previously
    announced strategic decisions. The impairment charges were
    necessary to adjust the carrying value of the assets to fair
    value. These restructuring activities were substantially
    complete at December 31, 2007.

In connection with previously announced strategic decisions, we
    recorded asset impairments, restructuring, and other special
    charges of $123.0 million in the first quarter of 2007.
    These charges primarily related to a voluntary severance program
    at one of our U.S. plants and other costs related to this
    action as well as management actions taken in the fourth quarter
    of 2006 to close two research and development facilities and one
    production facility outside the U.S. The component of these
    charges related to the non-cash asset impairment was
    $67.6 million, and were necessary to adjust the carrying
    value of the assets to fair value. These restructuring
    activities were substantially complete at December 31, 2007.

Product Liability
    and Other Special Charges

In the second and the third quarters of 2009, we incurred other
    special charges of $105.0 million and $125.0 million,
    respectively, related to advanced discussions with the attorneys
    general for several states that were not part of the Eastern
    District of Pennsylvania settlement, seeking to resolve their
    Zyprexa-related claims. The charge represents the currently
    probable and estimable exposures in connection with the
    states’ claims. Refer to Note 14 for additional
    information.

As discussed further in Note 14, in the third quarter of
    2008, we recorded a charge of $1.48 billion related to the
    Zyprexa investigations led by the U.S. Attorney for the
    Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as well as the resolution of a
    multi-state investigation regarding Zyprexa involving
    32 states and the District of Columbia.

As a result of our product liability exposures, the substantial
    majority of which were related to Zyprexa, we recorded net
    pretax charges of $111.9 million in 2007. These charges,
    which are net of anticipated insurance recoveries, include the
    costs of product liability settlements and related defense
    costs, reserves for product liability exposures and defense
    costs regarding known product liability claims, and expected
    future claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable
    estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims. See
    Note 14 for further discussion.

Note 6:  Financial
    Instruments and Investments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk
    consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing
    investments. Wholesale distributors of life-sciences products
    account for a substantial portion of trade receivables;
    collateral is generally not required. The risk associated with
    this concentration is mitigated by our ongoing credit review
    procedures and insurance. Major financial institutions represent
    the largest component of our investments in corporate debt
    securities. In accordance with documented corporate policies, we
    limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial
    institution or corporate issuer. We are exposed to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to risk-management instruments but do not expect
    any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their
    high credit ratings.

At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding foreign currency
    forward commitments to purchase 518 million British pounds
    and sell 578 million euro, commitments to purchase
    194 million U.S. dollars and sell 131 million
    euro, and commitments to buy 151 million euro and sell
    218 million U.S. dollars, which will settle within
    35 days.

At December 31, 2009, approximately 97 percent of our
    total debt is at a fixed rate. We have converted approximately
    65 percent of our fixed-rate debt to floating rates through
    the use of interest rate swaps.

The Effect of
    Risk-Management Instruments on the Statement of
    Operations

Both the gains on the hedged fixed-rate debt and the offsetting
    losses on the related interest rate swaps for 2009 were
    $369.5 million. All of these amounts net to zero and are
    included in

other-net,

expense (income).

We expect to reclassify $12.0 million of pretax net losses
    on cash flow hedges of the variability in expected future
    interest payments on floating rate debt from accumulated other
    comprehensive loss to earnings during the next 12 months.


Other-net,

expense (income) for 2009 includes the effective portion of
    losses on interest rate contracts in designated cash flow
    hedging relationships reclassified from accumulated other
    comprehensive loss into income of $10.2 million, and the
    net gains on foreign exchange contracts not designated as
    hedging instruments recognized in income of $43.4 million.
    The effective portions of net gains on interest rate contracts
    in designated cash flow hedging relationships recorded in other
    comprehensive income (loss) for 2009 was $38.0 million.

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    net losses related to ineffectiveness and net losses related to
    the portion of our risk-management hedging instruments, fair
    value and cash flow hedges excluded from the assessment of
    effectiveness were not material.

We determine fair values based on a market approach using quoted
    market values, significant other observable inputs for identical
    or comparable assets or liabilities, or discounted cash flow
    analyses. The fair value of equity method and other investments
    is not readily available. Approximately $235 million of our
    investments in debt securities, measured at fair value, mature
    within five years.

A summary of the fair value of

As discussed further in Note 2, a new accounting
    pronouncement effective in 2009 changed the accounting for

other-than-temporary

impairment losses for debt securities, providing that the amount
    of the

other-than-temporary

losses recorded in earnings is limited to the portion attributed
    to credit losses, with the remaining portion recorded in other
    comprehensive income (loss). A summary of

other-than-temporary

    The amount of credit losses represents the difference between
    the present value of cash flows expected to be collected on
    these securities and the amortized cost. Factors considered in
    assessing the credit loss were the position in the capital
    structure, vintage and amount of collateral, delinquency rates,
    current credit support, and geographic concentration.

The securities in an unrealized loss position are comprised of
    fixed-rate debt securities of varying maturities. The value of
    fixed income securities is sensitive to changes to the yield
    curve and other market conditions which led to the decline in
    value during 2008. Approximately 50 percent of the
    securities in a loss position are investment-grade debt
    securities. The majority of these securities first moved into an
    unrealized loss position during 2008. At this time, there is no
    indication of default on interest or principal payments for debt
    securities other than those for which an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge has been recorded. We do not intend to sell
    and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell
    the securities in a loss position before the market values
    recover or the underlying cash flows have been received, and we
    have concluded that no additional

other-than-temporary

loss is required to be charged to earnings as of
    December 31, 2009. The fair values of our auction rate
    securities and collateralized debt obligations held at
    December 31, 2009 were determined using Level 3
    inputs. We do not hold securities issued by structured
    investment vehicles at December 31, 2009.

The net adjustment to unrealized gains and losses (net of tax)
    on

available-for-sale

securities increased (decreased) other comprehensive income
    (loss) by $186.6 million, $(125.8) million, and
    $(5.4) million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

In March 2009, we issued $2.40 billion of fixed-rate notes
    with interest to be paid semi-annually. The $400.0 million
    of floating rate bonds outstanding at December 31, 2008
    were repaid with proceeds from this issuance.

The 6.55 percent Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)
    debentures are obligations of the ESOP but are shown on the
    consolidated balance sheet because we guarantee them. The
    principal and interest on the debt are funded by contributions
    from us and by dividends received on certain shares held by the
    ESOP. Because of the amortizing feature of the ESOP debt,
    bondholders will receive both interest and principal payments
    each quarter. The balance was $72.8 million and
    $81.9 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, and is included in Other in the table above.

The aggregate amounts of maturities on long-term debt for the
    next five years are as follows: 2010, $20.3 million; 2011,
    $15.8 million; 2012, $1.51 billion; 2013,
    $13.9 million; and 2014, $1.01 billion.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, short-term borrowings
    included $7.1 million and $5.43 billion, respectively,
    of notes payable to banks and commercial paper. Commercial paper
    was issued in late 2008 for the acquisition of ImClone. At
    December 31, 2009, we have $1.24 billion of unused
    committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which
    backs our commercial paper program and matures in May, 2011.
    Compensating balances and commitment fees are not material, and
    there are no conditions that are probable of occurring under
    which the lines may be withdrawn.


We have converted approximately 65 percent of all
    fixed-rate debt to floating rates through the use of interest
    rate swaps. The weighted-average effective borrowing rates based
    on debt obligations and interest rates at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, including the effects of interest rate swaps for
    hedged debt obligations, were 3.07 percent and
    4.77 percent, respectively.

In 2009, 2008, and 2007, cash payments of interest on borrowings
    totaled $205.9 million, $203.1 million, and
    $159.2 million, respectively, net of capitalized interest.

In accordance with the requirements of derivatives and hedging
    guidance, the portion of our fixed-rate debt obligations that is
    hedged is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as an
    amount equal to the sum of the debt’s carrying value plus
    the fair value adjustment representing changes in fair value of
    the hedged debt attributable to movements in market interest
    rates subsequent to the inception of the hedge.

Note 8:  Stock-Based
    Compensation

Stock-based compensation expense in the amount of
    $368.5 million, $255.3 million, and
    $282.0 million was recognized in 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively, as well as related tax benefits of
    $128.9 million, $88.6 million, and $96.4 million,
    respectively. Our stock-based compensation expense consists
    primarily of performance awards (PAs), and shareholder value
    awards (SVAs). We recognize the stock-based compensation expense
    over the requisite service period of the individual grantees,
    which generally equals the vesting period. We provide newly
    issued shares and treasury stock to satisfy stock option
    exercises and for the issuance of PA and SVA shares. We classify
    tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the
    compensation cost recognized for exercised stock options as a
    financing cash flow in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

At December 31, 2009, additional stock-based compensation
    awards may be granted under the 2002 Lilly Stock Plan for not
    more than 84.6 million shares.

Performance Award
    Program

PAs are granted to officers and management and are payable in
    shares of our common stock. The number of PA shares actually
    issued, if any, varies depending on the achievement of certain
    pre-established

earnings-per-share

targets. In 2009, we granted both a one-year and a two-year
    award to all global management as a transition to a two-year
    performance period for all PAs granted beginning in 2010. PA
    shares are accounted for at fair value based upon the closing
    stock price on the date of grant and fully vest at the end of
    the fiscal year of the grant. The fair values of performance
    awards granted in 2009 were $36.17 for the one-year award and
    $34.12 for the two-year award. The fair values of PAs granted in
    2008 and 2007 were $51.22 and $54.23, respectively. The number
    of shares ultimately issued for the performance award program is
    dependent upon the earnings achieved during the vesting period.
    Pursuant to this plan, approximately 2.8 million shares,
    2.5 million shares, and 2.3 million shares were issued
    in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Approximately
    4.4 million shares are expected to be issued in 2010. As of
    December 31, 2009, the total remaining unrecognized
    compensation cost related to nonvested PAs amounted to
    $88.8 million, which will be amortized over the
    weighted-average remaining requisite service period of
    12.0 months.

Shareholder Value
    Award Program

In 2007, we implemented a SVA program, which replaced our stock
    option program. SVAs are granted to officers and management and
    are payable in shares of common stock at the end of a three-year
    period. The number of shares actually issued varies depending on
    our stock price at the end of the three-year vesting period
    compared to pre-established target stock prices. We measure the
    fair value of the SVA unit on the grant date using a Monte Carlo
    simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes
    multiple input variables that determine the probability of
    satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award grant
    and calculates the fair value of the award. Expected
    volatilities utilized in the model are based on implied
    volatilities from traded options on our stock, historical
    volatility of our stock price, and other factors. Similarly, the
    dividend yield is based on historical experience and our
    estimate of future dividend yields. The risk-free interest rate
    is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at
    the time of grant. The weighted-average fair values of the SVA
    units granted during 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $33.97, $43.46,
    and $49.85, respectively, determined using the following
    assumptions:

The maximum number of shares that could ultimately be issued
    upon vesting of the SVA units outstanding at December 31,
    2009, is 3.7 million. Approximately 0.4 million shares
    are expected to be issued in 2010. As of December 31, 2009,
    the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to
    nonvested SVAs amounted to $48.1 million, which will be
    amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service
    period of 20.7 months.

Stock Option
    Program

Stock options were granted prior to 2007 to officers and
    management at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of
    our stock price at the date of grant. No stock options were
    granted subsequent to 2007. Options fully vest three years from
    the grant date and have a term of 10 years.

    of options vested during 2009, 2008, and 2007 amounted to
    $68.5 million, $84.1 million, and $381.8 million,
    respectively. We received cash of $0.2 million,
    $2.9 million, and $15.2 million from exercises of
    stock options during 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The
    recognized related tax benefits for all three years were not
    material.

Note 9:  Other
    Assets and Other Liabilities

Our other receivables include receivables from our collaboration
    partners, tax receivables, interest receivable for our interest
    rate swaps, and a variety of other items. The decrease in other
    receivables is


primarily attributable to a decrease in receivables from our
    collaboration partners and a decrease in tax receivables, offset
    by an increase in interest rate swap receivables.

Our prepaid expenses include prepaid income taxes and other
    global prepaid expenses. The increase in prepaid expenses is
    primarily attributable to income taxes paid on prepaid
    intercompany royalties.

Our sundry assets primarily include our capitalized computer
    software, deferred tax assets (Note 12), receivables from
    our collaboration partners, and the fair value of our interest
    rate swaps. The decrease in sundry assets is primarily
    attributable to a decrease in deferred tax assets and a decrease
    in the fair value of our interest rate swaps.

Our other current liabilities include product litigation, tax
    liabilities, deferred income from our collaboration
    arrangements, and a variety of other items. The decrease in
    other current liabilities is caused primarily by a decrease in
    product litigation liabilities, specifically, the
    $1.42 billion related to the EDPA settlements which was
    paid in 2009 as discussed in Note 14, and a decrease in
    current deferred taxes.

Our other noncurrent liabilities include deferred income from
    our collaboration and out-licensing arrangements, the long-term
    portion of our estimated product return liabilities, product
    litigation, and a variety of other items. The decrease in other
    noncurrent liabilities is primarily due to a decrease in
    deferred income and a decrease in product litigation reserves.

As of December 31, 2009, we have purchased
    $2.58 billion of our announced $3.0 billion share
    repurchase program. No shares were repurchased in 2009, 2008, or
    2007.

We have 5 million authorized shares of preferred stock. As
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008, no preferred stock has been
    issued.

We have funded an employee benefit trust with 50 million
    and 40 million shares of our common stock at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, to provide a
    source of funds to assist us in meeting our obligations under
    various employee benefit plans. In February 2009, we contributed
    an additional 10 million shares to the employee benefit
    trust, which resulted in a reclassification within equity from
    additional

paid-in

capital of $371.9 million and common stock of
    $6.3 million to the employee benefit trust of
    $378.2 million. The funding had no net impact on
    shareholders’ equity as we consolidate the employee benefit
    trust. The cost basis of the shares held in the trust was
    $3.01 billion and $2.64 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, and is shown as a reduction in
    shareholders’ equity, which offsets the resulting increases
    of $2.98 billion and $2.61 billion in additional
    paid-in capital and $31.3 million and $25.0 million in
    common stock at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Any dividend transactions between us and the trust are
    eliminated. Stock held by the trust is not considered
    outstanding in the computation of earnings per share. The assets
    of the trust were not used to fund any of our obligations under
    these employee benefit plans in 2009, 2008, or 2007.

We have an ESOP as a funding vehicle for the existing employee
    savings plan. The ESOP used the proceeds of a loan from us to
    purchase shares of common stock from the treasury. The ESOP
    issued $200.0 million of third-party debt, repayment of
    which was guaranteed by us (see Note 7). The proceeds were
    used to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market.
    Shares of common stock held by the ESOP will be allocated to
    participating employees annually through 2017 as part of our
    savings plan contribution. The fair value of shares allocated
    each period is recognized as compensation expense.

At December 31, 2009, we had net operating losses and other
    carryforwards for international and U.S. income tax
    purposes of $942.8 million: $126.3 million will expire
    within 5 years; $804.0 million will expire between 5
    and 20 years; and $12.5 million of the carryforwards
    will never expire. The primary component of the remaining
    portion of the deferred tax asset for tax loss carryforwards and
    carrybacks is related to net operating losses for state income
    tax purposes that are fully reserved. We also have tax credit
    carryforwards and carrybacks of $738.2 million available to
    reduce future income taxes; $268.7 million will be carried
    back; $37.6 million of the tax credit carryforwards will
    expire between 10 and 20 years; and $12.9 million of
    the tax credit carryforwards will never expire. The remaining
    portion of the tax credit carryforwards is related to federal
    tax credits of $94.6 million and state tax credits of
    $324.4 million, both of which are fully reserved.


Domestic and Puerto Rican companies contributed approximately
    39 percent and 7 percent in 2009 and 2007,
    respectively, to consolidated income before income taxes and
    generated the entire consolidated loss before income taxes in
    2008. We have a subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico under a tax
    incentive grant. The current tax incentive grant will not expire
    prior to 2017.

At December 31, 2009, we had an aggregate of
    $15.46 billion of unremitted earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries that have been or are intended to be permanently
    reinvested for continued use in foreign operations and that, if
    distributed, would result in additional income tax expense at
    approximately the U.S. statutory rate.

Cash payments (refunds) of income taxes totaled
    $1.14 billion, $(52.0) million, and $1.01 billion
    in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if
    recognized, would affect our effective tax rate was
    $836.8 million and $863.8 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction
    and various state, local, and

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

We are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local,
    or

non-U.S. income

tax examinations in major taxing jurisdictions for years before
    2002. During the first quarter of 2008, we completed and
    effectively settled our IRS audit of tax years

2001-2004

except for one matter for which we were seeking resolution
    through the IRS administrative appeals process. As a result of
    the IRS audit conclusion, gross unrecognized tax benefits were
    reduced by approximately $618 million, and the consolidated
    results of operations were benefited by $210.3 million
    through a reduction in income tax expense. The majority of the
    reduction in gross unrecognized tax benefits related to
    intercompany pricing positions that were agreed with the IRS in
    a prior audit cycle for which a prepayment of tax was made in
    2005. Application of the prepayment and utilization of tax
    carryovers resulted in a refund of approximately
    $50 million.

The IRS began its examination of tax years

2005-2007

during the third quarter of 2008. In addition, the IRS
    administrative appeals matter from the

2001-2004

IRS audit was settled in the third quarter of 2009. Considering
    the current status of the

2005-2007

IRS examination and the settlement of the IRS administrative
    appeals matter from the

2001-2004

audit, gross unrecognized tax benefits were reduced
    approximately $190 million in the third quarter of 2009. As
    a result, our income tax expense was reduced by
    $54.4 million. After utilization of all tax credit
    carryovers, a cash payment of $52.8 million was paid in the
    third quarter of 2009 upon settlement of the IRS appeals matter.
    While the IRS is currently examining tax years

2005-2007,

the resolution of all issues in this audit period will likely
    extend beyond the next 12 months.


We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, we
    recognized income tax expense (benefits) of $(1.9) million,
    $(118.0) million, and $66.6 million, respectively,
    related to interest and penalties. At December 31, 2009 and
    2008, our accruals for the payment of interest and penalties
    totaled $166.7 million and $177.6 million,
    respectively. Substantially all of the expense (benefit) and
    accruals relate to interest.

The unrecognized net actuarial loss and unrecognized prior
    service cost (benefit) have not yet been recognized in net
    periodic pension costs and are included in accumulated other
    comprehensive loss at December 31, 2009.

In 2010, we expect to recognize from accumulated other
    comprehensive loss as components of net periodic benefit cost,
    $176.4 million of unrecognized net actuarial loss and
    $6.4 million of unrecognized prior service cost related to
    our defined benefit pension plans, and $86.5 million of
    unrecognized net actuarial loss and $37.2 million of
    unrecognized prior service benefit related to our retiree health
    benefit plans. We do not expect any plan assets to be returned
    to us in 2010.

In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we have
    considered our historical assumptions compared with actual
    results, an analysis of current market conditions, our current
    and expected asset allocations, and the views of leading
    financial advisers and economists for future asset class
    returns. Our plan assets in our U.S. defined benefit
    pension and retiree health plans comprise approximately
    83 percent of our worldwide benefit plan assets. Including
    the investment losses due to overall market conditions in 2001,
    2002, and 2008, our

20-year

annualized rate of return on our U.S. defined benefit
    pension plans and retiree health benefit plan was approximately
    8.3 percent as of December 31, 2009. Health-care-cost
    trend rates are assumed to increase at an annual rate of
    8.0 percent in 2010, decreasing by approximately
    0.3 percent per year to an ultimate rate of
    5.3 percent by 2018.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future
    service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

The total accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit
    pension plans was $6.67 billion and $5.64 billion at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The projected
    benefit obligation and fair value of the plan assets for the
    defined benefit pension plans with projected benefit obligations
    in excess of plan assets were $7.55 billion and
    $6.01 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2009,
    and $6.35 billion and $4.80 billion, respectively, as
    of December 31, 2008. The accumulated benefit obligation
    and fair value of the plan assets for the defined benefit
    pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of
    plan assets were $1.01 billion and $107.4 million,
    respectively, as of December 31, 2009, and

If the health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one
    percentage point each future year, the December 31, 2009,
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would increase by
    $167.5 million (8.3 percent) and the aggregate of the
    service cost and interest cost components of the 2009 annual
    expense would increase by $18.9 million
    (10.9 percent). A one percentage point decrease in these
    rates


would decrease the December 31, 2009, accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligation by $153.0 million
    (7.6 percent) and the aggregate of the 2009 service cost
    and interest cost by $15.8 million (9.1 percent).

We have defined contribution savings plans that cover our
    eligible employees worldwide. The purpose of these defined
    contribution plans is generally to provide additional financial
    security during retirement by providing employees with an
    incentive to save. Our contributions to the plan are based on
    employee contributions and the level of our match. Expenses
    under the plans totaled $127.6 million,
    $114.1 million, and $112.3 million for the years 2009,
    2008, and 2007, respectively.

We provide certain other postemployment benefits primarily
    related to disability benefits and accrue for the related cost
    over the service lives of employees. Expenses associated with
    these benefit plans in 2009, 2008, and 2007 were not significant.

Benefit Plan
    Investments

Our benefit plan investment policies are set with specific
    consideration of return and risk requirements in relationship to
    the respective liabilities. U.S. plans represent
    83 percent of our global investments. Given the long term
    nature of our U.S. liabilities, the U.S. plans have
    the flexibility to manage an above average degree of risk in the
    asset portfolios. At the investment policy level, there are no
    specifically prohibited investments. However, within individual
    investment manager mandates, restrictions and limitations are
    contractually set to align with our investment objectives,
    ensure risk control, and limit concentrations.

We manage our portfolio to minimize any concentration of risk by
    allocating funds within asset categories. In addition, within a
    category we use different managers with various management
    objectives to eliminate any significant concentration of risk.

Our global benefit plans may enter into contractual arrangements
    (derivatives) to implement the local investment policy or manage
    particular portfolio risks. Derivatives are principally used to
    increase or decrease exposure to a particular public equity,
    fixed income, commodity or currency market more rapidly or less
    expensively than could be accomplished through the use of the
    cash markets. The plans utilize both exchange traded and

over-the-counter

instruments. The maximum exposure to either a market or
    counterparty credit loss is limited to the carrying value of the
    receivable, and is managed within contractual limits. We expect
    all of our counterparties to meet their obligations. The gross
    values of these derivative receivables and payables are not
    material to the global asset portfolio, and their values are
    reflected within the tables below.

The U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit
    plan allocation strategy is currently comprised of approximately
    88 percent growth investments and 12 percent fixed
    income investments. The growth investment allocation encompasses
    U.S. and international public equity securities, hedge
    funds, and private equity-like investments. These portfolio
    allocations are intended to reduce overall risk by providing
    diversification, while seeking moderate to high returns over the
    long term.

Public equity securities are well diversified and invested in
    U.S. and international

small-to-large

companies across various asset managers and styles. The
    remaining portion of the growth portfolio is invested in private
    alternative investments.

Hedge funds are privately owned institutional investment funds
    that generally have moderate liquidity. Hedge funds seek
    specified levels of absolute return regardless of overall market
    conditions, and generally have low correlations to public equity
    and debt markets. Hedge funds often invest substantially in
    financial market instruments (stocks, bonds, commodities,
    currencies, derivatives, etc.) using a very broad range of
    trading activities to manage portfolio risks. Hedge fund
    strategies focus primarily on security selection and seek to be
    neutral with respect to market moves. Common groupings of hedge
    fund strategies include relative value, tactical, and event
    driven. Relative value strategies include arbitrage, when the
    same asset can simultaneously be bought and sold at different
    prices, achieving an immediate profit. Tactical strategies often
    take long and short positions to reduce or eliminate overall
    market risks while seeking a particular investment opportunity.
    Event strategy opportunities can evolve from specific


company announcements such as mergers and acquisitions, and
    typically have little correlation to overall market directional
    movements. Our hedge fund investments are made through limited
    partnership interests primarily in fund of funds structures to
    ensure diversification across many strategies and many
    individual managers.

Private equity-like investment funds typically have low
    liquidity and are made through long-term partnerships or joint
    ventures that invest in pools of capital invested in primarily
    non-publicly traded entities. Underlying investments include
    venture capital (early stage investing), buyout, and special
    situation investing. Private equity management firms typically
    acquire and then reorganize private companies to create
    increased long term value. Private equity-like funds usually
    have a limited life of approximately

10-15 years,

and require a minimum investment commitment from their limited
    partners. Our private investments are made both directly into
    funds and through fund of funds structures to ensure broad
    diversification of management styles and assets across the
    portfolio.

Fixed income investments are primarily made in investment grade
    fixed income securities in U.S. Treasuries and Agencies,
    investment grade corporates, mortgage-backed securities and
    commercial mortgage-backed obligations.

Other assets include cash and cash equivalents and

mark-to-market

value of derivatives.

The cash value of the trust-owned insurance contract is invested
    in investment grade publicly traded equity and fixed income
    securities.

In 2010, we expect to contribute approximately $100 million
    to our defined benefit pension plans to satisfy minimum funding
    requirements for the year. In addition, we expect to contribute
    approximately $300 million of additional discretionary
    funding in 2010 to our global defined benefit pension and post
    retirement health benefit plans.

Note 14:  Contingencies

We are a party to various legal actions, government
    investigations, and environmental proceedings. The most
    significant of these are described below. While it is not
    possible to determine the outcome of these matters, we believe
    that, except as specifically noted below, the resolution of all
    such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly
    be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one
    accounting period.

Patent
    Litigation

We are engaged in the following patent litigation matters
    brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch-Waxman Act
    (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of
    1984):

•

Cymbalta:  Sixteen generic drug manufacturers have
    submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) seeking
    permission to market generic versions of Cymbalta prior to the
    expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (the earliest of
    which expires in 2013). Of these challengers, all allege
    non-infringement of the patent claims directed to the commercial
    formulation, and nine allege invalidity of the patent claims
    directed to the active ingredient duloxetine. Of the nine
    challengers to the compound patent claims, one further alleges
    invalidity of the claims directed to the use of Cymbalta for
    treating fibromyalgia, and one alleges the patent having claims
    directed to the active ingredient is unenforceable. In November
    2008 we filed lawsuits in U.S. District Court for the
    Southern District of Indiana against Actavis Elizabeth LLC;
    Aurobindo Pharma Ltd.; Cobalt Laboratories, Inc.; Impax
    Laboratories, Inc.; Lupin Limited; Sandoz Inc.; and Wockhardt
    Limited, seeking rulings that the patents are valid, infringed,
    and enforceable. We filed similar lawsuits in the same court
    against Sun Pharma Global, Inc. in December 2008 and against
    Anchen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in August 2009. The cases have been
    consolidated and actions against all but Wockhardt Limited have
    been stayed pursuant to stipulations by the defendants to be
    bound by the outcome of the litigation through appeal.

Gemzar:  Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc., now Hospira, Inc.
    (Hospira); Fresenius Kabi Oncology Plc (Fresenius); Sicor
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., now Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc.
    (Teva); and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) each
    submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic versions
    of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant
    U.S. patents (compound patent expiring in


2010 and

method-of-use

patent expiring in 2013), and alleging that these patents are
    invalid. Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz) and APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC (APP)
    have similarly challenged our

method-of-use

patent. We filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for
    the Southern District of Indiana against Teva (February 2006),
    Hospira (October 2006 and January 2008), Sandoz (October 2009),
    APP (December 2009), and Fresenius (February 2010), seeking
    rulings that our patents are valid and are being infringed.
    Sandoz withdrew its ANDA and the suit against it was dismissed
    in February 2010. The trial against Teva was held in September
    2009 and we are waiting for a ruling. Teva’s ANDAs have
    been approved by the FDA; however, Teva must provide
    90 days notice prior to marketing generic Gemzar to allow
    time for us to seek a preliminary injunction. Both suits against
    Hospira have been administratively closed, and the parties have
    agreed to be bound by the results of the Teva suit. In November
    2007, Sun filed a declaratory judgment action in the United
    States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan,
    seeking rulings that our

method-of-use

and compound patents are invalid or unenforceable, or would not
    be infringed by the sale of Sun’s generic product. In
    August 2009, the District Court granted a motion by Sun for
    partial summary judgment, invalidating our

method-of-use

patent. We have appealed this decision. This ruling has no
    bearing on the compound patent. The trial originally scheduled
    for December 2009 has been postponed while the court considers
    Sun’s second summary judgment motion, related to the
    validity of our compound patent. Sun and APP have received
    tentative approval for their products from the FDA, but are
    prohibited from entering the market by

30-month

stays, which expire in June 2010 for Sun and May 2012 for APP.

•

Alimta:  Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc. (Teva), APP,
    and Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr) each submitted ANDAs seeking
    approval to market generic versions of Alimta prior to the
    expiration of the relevant U.S. patent (licensed from the
    Trustees of Princeton University and expiring in 2016), and
    alleging the patent is invalid. We, along with Princeton, filed
    lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Delaware against Teva, APP, and Barr seeking rulings that the
    compound patent is valid and infringed. Trial is scheduled for
    November 2010 against Teva and APP.

•

Evista:  In 2006, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.
    (Teva) submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a generic
    version of Evista prior to the expiration of our relevant
    U.S. patents (expiring in

2012-2017)

and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or
    not infringed. In June 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in
    the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
    Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid,
    enforceable, and being infringed by Teva. The trial against Teva
    was completed in March 2009. In September 2009, the court upheld
    our

method-of-use

patents (the last expires in 2014). Teva has appealed that
    ruling. In addition, the court held that our particle-size
    patent (expiring 2017) is invalid. We have appealed that
    ruling.

•

Strattera:  Actavis Elizabeth LLC (Actavis), Apotex
    Inc. (Apotex), Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. (Aurobindo), Mylan
    Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan), Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), Sun
    Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Sun), and Teva
    Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) each submitted an ANDA seeking
    permission to market generic versions of Strattera prior to the
    expiration of our relevant U.S. patent (expiring in 2017),
    and alleging that this patent is invalid. In 2007, we brought a
    lawsuit against Actavis, Apotex, Aurobindo, Mylan, Sandoz, Sun,
    and Teva in the United States District Court for the District of
    New Jersey. The court has ruled on all pending summary judgment
    motions, and granted our infringement motion. The remaining
    invalidity defenses will be decided at trial, which could take
    place as early as the third quarter of 2010. Several companies
    have received tentative approval to market generic atomoxetine,
    but are prohibited from entering the market by a

30-month

stay which expires in November 2010.

We believe each of these Hatch-Waxman challenges is without
    merit and expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is
    not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and
    accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail.
    An unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a
    material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity, and financial position.

We have received challenges to Zyprexa patents in a number of
    countries outside the U.S.:

•

In Canada, several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have
    challenged the validity of our Zyprexa patent (expiring in
    2011). In April 2007, the Canadian Federal Court ruled against
    the first challenger, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and that ruling was
    affirmed on appeal in February 2008. In June 2007, the Canadian
    Federal Court held that an invalidity allegation of a second
    challenger, Novopharm Ltd. (Novopharm), was justified and denied
    our request that Novopharm be prohibited from receiving
    marketing approval for generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm
    began selling generic olanzapine in Canada in the third quarter
    of 2007. In September 2009, the Canadian Federal Court ruled
    against us in the Novapharm suit, finding our patent invalid. We
    have appealed this decision. If the decision is upheld, we could
    face liability for damages related to delays in the launch of
    generic olanzapine products; however, we have concluded at this
    time that the damages are not probable or estimable.

•

In Germany, the German Federal Supreme Court upheld the validity
    of our Zyprexa patent (expiring in 2011) in December 2008,
    reversing an earlier decision of the Federal Patent Court.
    Following the


decision of the Supreme Court, the generic companies who
    launched generic olanzapine based on the earlier decision either
    agreed to withdraw from the market or were subject to
    injunction. We are pursuing these companies for damages arising
    from infringement.

•

We have received challenges in a number of other countries,
    including Spain, the United Kingdom (U.K.), and several smaller
    European countries. In Spain, we have been successful at both
    the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the generic
    manufacturers’ challenges, but additional actions are now
    pending. In the U.K., the generic pharmaceutical manufacturer
    Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (UK) Limited
    (Dr. Reddy’s) has challenged the validity of our
    Zyprexa patent (expiring in 2011). In October 2008, the Patents
    Court in the High Court, London ruled that our patent was valid.
    Dr. Reddy’s appealed this decision. The U.K. Court of
    Appeal affirmed the validity of the patent in December 2009.
    Dr. Reddy’s did not seek further appeal to the U.K.
    Supreme Court, therefore the U.K. proceedings are concluded.

We are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our
    Zyprexa patents on a

country-by-country

basis. We cannot determine the outcome of this litigation. The
    availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could
    have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
    operations.

Xigris and Evista: In June 2002, Ariad Pharmaceuticals,
    Inc. (Ariad), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the
    Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the President
    and Fellows of Harvard College in the U.S. District Court
    for the District of Massachusetts sued us, alleging that sales
    of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the
    infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural
    cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking
    royalties on past and future sales of these products. Following
    jury and bench trials on separate issues, the U.S. District
    Court of Massachusetts entered final judgment in September 2007
    that Ariad’s claims were valid, infringed, and enforceable,
    and finding damages in the amount of $65 million plus a
    2.3 percent royalty on net U.S. sales of Xigris and
    Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the Court
    deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all
    rights to appeal are exhausted. In April 2009, the Court of
    Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned the District Court
    judgment, concluding that Ariad’s asserted patent claims
    are invalid. In August 2009, the Court of Appeals agreed to
    review this decision en banc, thereby vacating the Court of
    Appeals decision. The en banc hearing occurred in December 2009
    and we are awaiting a decision. Nevertheless, we believe that
    these allegations are without legal merit, that we will
    ultimately prevail on these issues, and therefore that the
    likelihood of any monetary damages is remote.

Zyprexa
    Litigation

We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa
    product liability lawsuits in the U.S. and have been
    notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed
    suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the
    “claims”) allege a variety of injuries from the use of
    Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or
    contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims
    seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically
    accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side
    effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we
    improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits
    are part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding
    before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District
    Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596).

Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various
    claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product
    liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the
    claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 32,670
    claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits
    and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as
    follows:

•

In 2005, we settled and paid more than 8,000 claims for
    $690.0 million, plus $10.0 million to cover
    administration of the settlement.

•

In 2007, we settled and paid more than 18,000 claims for
    approximately $500 million.

We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in
    all remaining claims. The U.S. Zyprexa product liability
    claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 170
    lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 260 plaintiffs,
    of which about 140 cases covering about 150 plaintiffs are part
    of the MDL. The MDL cases have been scheduled for trial in
    groups, and no specific trial dates for trial groups have been
    assigned. We also have trials scheduled in Texas state court in
    May and August 2010 and in Ohio in August 2010.

In January 2009, we reached resolution with the Office of the
    U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
    (EDPA), and the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units of
    36 states and the District of Columbia, of an investigation
    related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices
    with respect to Zyprexa. As part of the resolution, we pled
    guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug, and
    Cosmetic Act for the off-label promotion of Zyprexa in elderly
    populations as treatment for dementia, including
    Alzheimer’s dementia, between September 1999 and March
    2001. We recorded a charge of $1.42 billion for this matter
    in the third quarter of 2008. In 2009, we paid substantially all
    of this amount, as required


by the settlement agreements. As part of the settlement, we have
    entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of
    Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health
    and Human Services (HHS), which requires us to maintain our
    compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate
    integrity obligations for five years. The agreement also
    provides for an independent third-party review organization to
    assess and report on the company’s systems, processes,
    policies, procedures, and practices.

In October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and
    the District of Columbia related to a multistate investigation
    brought under various state consumer protection laws. While
    there is no finding that we have violated any provision of the
    state laws under which the investigations were conducted, we
    accrued and paid $62.0 million and agreed to undertake
    certain commitments regarding Zyprexa for a period of six years,
    through consent decrees filed with the settling states.

We have been served with lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska,
    Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi,
    Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and
    West Virginia alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to
    diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly
    promoted the drug. These suits seek to recover the costs paid
    for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as
    well as the costs alleged to have been incurred and that will be
    incurred by the states to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. The
    Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana,
    New Mexico, and West Virginia cases are part of the MDL
    proceedings in the EDNY. The Alaska case was settled in March
    2008 for a payment of $15.0 million, plus terms designed to
    ensure, subject to certain limitations and conditions, that
    Alaska is treated as favorably as certain other states that may
    settle with us in the future over similar claims. We are in
    advanced discussions with the attorneys general for several of
    these states, seeking to resolve their Zyprexa-related claims,
    and we have agreed to settlements with the states of Arkansas,
    Connecticut, Idaho, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Carolina,
    Utah, and West Virginia. In the second and third quarters of
    2009, we incurred pretax charges of $105.0 million and
    $125.0 million, respectively, reflecting the currently
    probable and estimable exposures in connection with these
    claims. The Pennsylvania case is set for trial in April 2010 in
    state court.

In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be
    nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and
    third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have
    made or will make payments for their members or insured patients
    being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been
    consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under
    certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil
    RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the
    cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and
    attorneys’ fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the
    EDNY in 2006 on similar grounds. In September 2008, Judge
    Weinstein certified a class consisting of third-party payors,
    excluding governmental entities and individual consumers. We
    appealed the certification order, and Judge Weinstein’s
    order denying our motion for summary judgment, in September
    2008. While the Second Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral
    arguments on the appeal in December 2009, no opinions have been
    rendered. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund
    brought claims in state court in Pennsylvania as insurer of
    Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa on
    similar grounds as described in the New York cases. As with the
    product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we
    inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa
    and improperly promoted the drug. In December 2009, the court
    granted our summary judgment motion dismissing the case.
    Plaintiffs have appealed this decision.

In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits seeking class
    action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa.
    One of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of
    Quebec, and a second has been certified in Ontario and includes
    all Canadian residents except for residents of Quebec and
    British Columbia. The allegations in the Canadian actions are
    similar to those in the product liability litigation pending in
    the U.S. We are in advanced discussions to resolve all
    Zyprexa class-action litigation in Canada.

We cannot determine with certainty the additional number of
    lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. The ultimate
    resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation
    could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results
    of operations, liquidity, and financial position.

Other Product
    Liability Litigation

We have been named as a defendant in numerous other product
    liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES),
    thimerosal, and Byetta. The majority of these claims are covered
    by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits.

Product Liability
    Insurance

Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible
    that we could become subject to large numbers of product
    liability and related claims for other products in the future.
    In the past several years, we have been unable to attain product
    liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market.
    Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed
    products, we have been and expect that we will


continue to be completely self-insured for future product
    liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we
    will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the
    future.

Environmental
    Matters

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
    and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, we have been
    designated as one of several potentially responsible parties
    with respect to fewer than 10 sites. Under Superfund, each
    responsible party may be jointly and severally liable for the
    entire amount of the cleanup. We also continue remediation of
    certain of our own sites. We have accrued for estimated
    Superfund cleanup costs, remediation, and certain other
    environmental matters. This takes into account, as applicable,
    available information regarding site conditions, potential
    cleanup methods, estimated costs, and the extent to which other
    parties can be expected to contribute to payment of those costs.
    We have limited liability insurance coverage for certain
    environmental liabilities.

The amounts above are net of income taxes. The income taxes
    associated with the unrecognized net actuarial losses and prior
    service costs on our defined benefit pension and retiree health
    benefit plans (Note 13) were a benefit of
    $92.4 million for 2009. The income taxes associated with
    the unrealized gains (losses) on securities was an expense of
    $103.2 million for 2009. The income taxes related to the
    other components of comprehensive income (loss) were not
    significant, as income taxes were not provided for foreign
    currency translation.

The unrealized gains (losses) on securities is net of
    reclassification adjustments of net gains (losses) of
    $19.0 million, $(1.7) million, and $5.8 million,
    net of tax, in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, for net
    realized gains (losses) on sales of securities included in net
    income. The effective portion of cash flow hedges is net of
    reclassification adjustments of zero, $9.6 million, and
    $8.8 million, net of tax, in 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively, for realized losses on foreign currency options
    and $6.7 million, $7.9 million, and
    $11.6 million, net of tax, in 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively, for interest expense on interest rate swaps
    designated as cash flow hedges.

Generally, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are
    translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange
    rate. For those operations, changes in exchange rates generally
    do not affect cash flows; therefore, resulting translation
    adjustments are made in shareholders’ equity rather than in
    income.


Management’s
    Reports

Management’s
    Report for Financial Statements—Eli Lilly and Company and
    Subsidiaries

Management of Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries is
    responsible for the accuracy, integrity, and fair presentation
    of the financial statements. The statements have been prepared
    in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
    the United States and include amounts based on judgments and
    estimates by management. In management’s opinion, the
    consolidated financial statements present fairly our financial
    position, results of operations, and cash flows.

In addition to the system of internal accounting controls, we
    maintain a code of conduct (known as

The Red Book

) that
    applies to all employees worldwide, requiring proper overall
    business conduct, avoidance of conflicts of interest, compliance
    with laws, and confidentiality of proprietary information.

The Red Book

is reviewed on a periodic basis with
    employees worldwide, and all employees are required to report
    suspected violations. A hotline number is published in

The
    Red Book

to enable employees to report suspected violations
    anonymously. Employees who report suspected violations are
    protected from discrimination or retaliation by the company. In
    addition to

The Red Book

, the CEO, and all financial
    management must sign a financial code of ethics, which further
    reinforces their fiduciary responsibilities.

The consolidated financial statements have been audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm. Their responsibility is to examine our
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Ernst & Young’s
    opinion with respect to the fairness of the presentation of the
    statements is included in Item 8 of our annual report on

Form 10-K.

Ernst & Young reports directly to the audit committee
    of the board of directors.

Our audit committee includes five nonemployee members of the
    board of directors, all of whom are independent from our
    company. The committee charter, which is available on our web
    site, outlines the members’ roles and responsibilities and
    is consistent with enacted corporate reform laws and
    regulations. It is the audit committee’s responsibility to
    appoint an independent registered public accounting firm subject
    to shareholder ratification, approve both audit and nonaudit
    services performed by the independent registered public
    accounting firm, and review the reports submitted by the firm.
    The audit committee meets several times during the year with
    management, the internal auditors, and the independent public
    accounting firm to discuss audit activities, internal controls,
    and financial reporting matters, including reviews of our
    externally published financial results. The internal auditors
    and the independent registered public accounting firm have full
    and free access to the committee.

We are dedicated to ensuring that we maintain the high standards
    of financial accounting and reporting that we have established.
    We are committed to providing financial information that is
    transparent, timely, complete, relevant, and accurate. Our
    culture demands integrity and an unyielding commitment to strong
    internal practices and policies. Finally, we have the highest
    confidence in our financial reporting, our underlying system of
    internal controls, and our people, who are objective in their
    responsibilities and operate under a code of conduct and the
    highest level of ethical standards.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting—Eli
    Lilly and Company and Subsidiaries

Management of Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We have global
    financial policies that govern critical areas, including
    internal controls, financial accounting and reporting, fiduciary
    accountability, and safeguarding of corporate assets. Our
    internal accounting control systems are designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that
    transactions are executed in accordance with management’s
    authorization and are properly recorded, and that accounting
    records are adequate for preparation of financial statements and
    other financial information. A staff of internal auditors
    regularly monitors, on a worldwide basis, the adequacy and
    effectiveness of internal accounting controls. The general
    auditor reports directly to the audit committee of the board of
    directors.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on our evaluation under this framework, we
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2009. However, because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
    in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The internal control over financial reporting has been assessed
    by Ernst & Young LLP. Their responsibility is to
    evaluate whether internal control over financial reporting was
    designed and operating effectively.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Eli Lilly and
    Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, cash flows, and comprehensive income (loss) for each
    of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009.
    These financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Eli
    Lilly and Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Eli Lilly and
    Company

We have audited Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries’
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Eli Lilly and Company and
    subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    2009 consolidated financial statements of Eli Lilly and Company
    and subsidiaries and our report dated February 22, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

Under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    regulations, management of a reporting company, with the
    participation of the principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer, must periodically evaluate the company’s
    “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are
    defined generally as controls and other procedures of a
    reporting company designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed by the reporting company in its periodic reports
    filed with the SEC (such as this

Form 10-K)

is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely
    basis.

Our management, with the participation of John C.
    Lechleiter, Ph.D., chairman, president, and chief executive
    officer, and Derica W. Rice, executive vice president, global
    services and chief financial officer, evaluated our disclosure
    controls and procedures as of December 31, 2009, and
    concluded that they are effective.

Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting

Dr. Lechleiter and Mr. Rice provided a report on
    behalf of management on our internal control over financial
    reporting, in which management concluded that the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting is effective at
    December 31, 2009. In addition, Ernst & Young
    LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, provided an attestation report on the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting. You can find the full
    text of management’s report and Ernst &
    Young’s attestation report in Item 8, and both reports
    are incorporated by reference in this Item.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

During the fourth quarter of 2009, there were no changes in our
    internal control over financial reporting that materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting.

    financial reporting, internal controls, and financial
    stewardship.

Both documents are online on our web site at

In the event of any amendments to, or waivers from, a provision
    of the code affecting the chief executive officer, chief
    financial officer, chief accounting officer, controller, or
    persons performing similar functions, we intend to post on the
    above web site within four business days after the event a
    description of the amendment or waiver as required under
    applicable SEC rules. We will maintain that information on our


web site for at least 12 months. Paper copies of these
    documents are available free of charge upon request to the
    company’s secretary at the address on the front of this

Form 10-K.

Corporate
    Governance

In our proxy statements, we describe the procedures by which
    shareholders can recommend nominees to our board of directors.
    There have been no changes in those procedures since they were
    last published in our proxy statement of March 9, 2009.

The board has appointed an audit committee consisting entirely
    of independent directors in accordance with applicable SEC and
    New York Stock Exchange rules for audit committees. The members
    of the committee are Michael L. Eskew (chair), Martin S.
    Feldstein, R. David Hoover, Douglas R. Oberhelman, and
