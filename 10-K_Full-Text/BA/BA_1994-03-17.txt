                                    PART I
Item 1. Business

  The Boeing Company, together with its subsidiaries (herein referred to as the
"Company"), is one of the world's major aerospace firms. The Company operates 
primarily in two industry segments: Commercial Aircraft, and Defense and Space.
Commercial Aircraft operations - conducted principally through Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group - involve development, production and marketing of commercial jet
transports and providing related support services, principally to commercial 
customers. Defense and Space operations - conducted principally through Boeing 
Defense & Space Group - involve research, development, production, modification 
and support of military aircraft and helicopters and related systems, space 
systems and missile systems. Defense and Space operations are principally with 
the U.S. Government.
  With respect to the Commercial Aircraft segment, the Company is a leading 
producer of commercial transport aircraft and offers a family of commercial 
jetliners designed to meet a broad spectrum of passenger and cargo requirements
of domestic and foreign airlines. This family of jet transport aircraft 
currently includes the 737 and 757 standard-body models series and the 747 and 
767 wide-body models series. In early 1992, the Company sold the de Havilland 
division of Boeing of Canada, which produced turboprop commuter aircraft.
  The Company continues development of the 777 twinjet, a new jet transport 
which will seat from 375 to 400 passengers in two classes and will fill a market
segment between the 767-300 and 747-400 models. It will feature a new wing,
wide-body fuselage and the latest high-efficiency turbofan engines. This new 
twinjet will continue to require substantial investments in development, 
tooling and inventory, leading up to initial deliveries in mid-1995.
  Principal ongoing activities in the Defense and Space segment include Space 
Station development and other space related activities, production and 
remanufacturing of CH-47 helicopters, F-22 fighter aircraft engineering 
and manufacturing development activities, B-2 bomber subcontract work, 
V-22 Osprey tiltrotor transport development and test activities, E-3 
Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) updates and the new 767-based 
AWACS, RAH-66 Comanche helicopter development activities, Avenger air defense
system deliveries, updating and modifying various military aircraft and 
systems, and classified projects.  The Space Station, F-22 fighter, RAH-66 
Comanche helicopter, and V-22 Osprey tiltrotor transport are developmental 
programs currently being conducted primarily under cost-reimbursement-type 
contracts.  The Company's activities on the F-22, RAH-66, and V-22 programs 
are under joint venture teaming arrangements with other companies.
  The Company conducts various other activities representing only a small 
portion of the Company's total activities, primarily developing large-scale 
information systems and conducting management services, principally for 
government agencies. In 1993, the Company discontinued its involvement
with the U.S. Government's strategic petroleum reserve.
  Commercial jet transports are normally sold on a firm fixed-price basis with 
an indexed price escalation clause. Defense and space developmental programs 
are normally performed under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, but certain 
developmental programs have been under fixed-price arrangements in the recent 
past. Developmental contracts often contain incentives related to cost 
performance and/or awards for other contract milestone accomplishments. 
Defense and space production programs are generally performed under firm 
fixed-price contracts or fixed-price contracts containing incentive 
provisions related to costs.



                                2 of 109 

  Revenues, operating profits and other financial data of the Company's major 
industry segments for the three years ended December 31, 1993, are set forth 
on pages 51 and 52 of the Company's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders and are
incorporated herein by reference.
  The worldwide market for commercial jet transports is predominantly driven by 
long-term trends in airline passenger traffic. The principal factors in 
long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth in developed and 
emerging markets and political stability. Demand for the Company's products 
is further influenced by profitability of the airline industry, the 
globalization and consolidation of the industry, airport and air traffic 
control infrastructure, noise regulations, product development and strategy, 
and price and other competitive factors.
  The Company's ability to deliver jet transports on schedule is dependent upon 
a variety of factors, including availability of raw materials, performance of 
suppliers and subcontractors, and certifications by the Federal Aviation
Administration. The introduction of new commercial aircraft programs and major
derivatives involves increased risks associated with meeting development, 
production and certification schedules.
  The Company experienced no significant shortages of raw materials essential to
its business during 1993 and does not anticipate any shortages of critical 
commodities over the longer term, although this is difficult to assess because
many factors causing such possible shortages are outside its control.
  The Company is highly dependent on its suppliers and subcontractors in order 
to meet commitments to its customers. Many major components and equipment 
items for the Company's products are procured from or subcontracted to various
domestic and foreign companies. Although the Company has periodically 
experienced certain problems with supplier and subcontractor performance, 
these situations have been manageable.
  While the Company owns numerous patents and has licenses under patents owned 
by others relating to its products and their manufacture, it does not believe 
that its business would be materially affected by the expiration of any patents
or termination of any patent license agreements. The Company has no trademarks, 
franchises or concessions that are considered to be of material importance to 
the conduct of its business.
  The Company is a major supplier to U.S. Government agencies, principally 
the Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA). This portion of the Company's business is highly sen-
sitive to shifts in the national economy, changing national priorities, fluc-
tuations in the defense and space budgets, and Government procurement policies.
  The Company's backlog of firm contractual orders (in billions) at December 31 
follows:
                                      1993      1992
                                      ----      ----
  Commercial Aircraft                $69.0     $82.0
  Defense and Space                    4.2       5.6
  Other industries                      .3        .3
                                     -----     -----
   Total                             $73.5     $87.9
                                     =====     =====  
 







                                3 of 109 

  Not included in firm contractual backlog are purchase options and announced 
orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed and orders from 
customers which have filed for bankruptcy protection. Additionally, U.S. 
Government and foreign military firm backlog is limited to amounts obligated to
contracts. Unobligated U.S. Government contract values not included in backlog 
totaled $6.9 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 1993 and 1992.
  In evaluating the Company's contractual backlog for commercial customers, 
certain risk factors should be considered.  Many of the orders extend out 
several years, with approximately 60% of the contractual backlog for commercial
jet airplanes scheduled to be delivered after 1995. Changes in the economic 
environment and the financial condition of airlines can result in customer 
requests for rescheduling or cancellation of contractual orders.
  Contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to termination for default or 
for convenience by the Government if deemed in its best interests. Contracts 
which are terminated for convenience generally provide for payments to a 
contractor for its costs and a proportionate share of profit for work 
accomplished through the date of termination. Contracts which are terminated 
for default generally provide that the Government pays only for the work it 
has accepted, can require the contractor to pay the difference between the 
original contract price and the cost to reprocure the contract items net of 
the value of the work accepted from the original contractor, and can hold a
contractor liable for damages. (See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings regarding the 
Government's partial termination of the Peace Shield program for alleged 
default.) A termination for default, if upheld, also may adversely affect a 
contractor's ability to compete successfully for other Government contracts.
  The Commercial Aircraft segment is highly competitive. The Company's 
commercial aircraft sales are subject to intense competition from aircraft 
manufactured by other companies, both foreign and domestic, including foreign 
companies which are nationally owned or subsidized. To meet competition, the 
Company maintains a continuous program directed toward enhancing the performance
and capability of its products and has a family of commercial aircraft to meet 
varied and changing airline requirements. The Company continually evaluates 
opportunities to improve current models, and conducts ongoing marketplace 
assessments to ensure that its family of jet transports is well positioned to 
meet future requirements of the airline industry. The fundamental strategy is to
maintain a broad product line responsive to changing market conditions by 
maximizing commonality within and across the Boeing family of airplanes. The 
major focus of development activities over the past three years has been the 777
wide-body twinjet which is scheduled to enter airline service in mid-1995. The 
777 is designed to meet airline requirements for an efficient, comfortable, 
high-capacity airplane to be used in domestic and intra-regional markets. A 
long-range version of the 777 is being offered for delivery in late 1996, and 
the aircraft could be further developed for greater capability including 
additional range and a stretched fuselage. During 1993 the Company began 
development activities on the next generation of the 737 family of 
short-to-medium-range jetliners that will provide greater range, 
increased speed, and reduced noise and emissions while maintaining 737 family 
commonality. The first next-generation 737, designated the 737-700, is the 
middle-sized member of the 737 family. Customer orders will determine the 
sequence and timing of the introduction of the smaller 737-600 and the 
larger 737-800.
  The Company continues to assess the market potential for new or derivative 
aircraft that are larger and have more range than the 747-400. Because of 
a relatively limited market and the heavy resource investment levels 
required, the Company signed an agreement with four European aerospace
companies in 1993 to study the feasibility of developing a new aircraft  
capable of carrying between 550 and 800 passengers.
                                4 of 109 

  While product development activities are principally oriented toward 
maintaining and enhancing the competitiveness of the Boeing subsonic fleet, 
the Company is also involved in studies to understand the technological and
economic issues associated with development of commercial supersonic 
aircraft.
  During 1993, announced new orders for the Company's commercial jet transports 
totaled 247 aircraft, which represented approximately 75% of the dollar value 
of total new announced orders during the year. In terms of revenue, the 
Company's commercial jet transport deliveries represented approximately 60% of
total market deliveries during the five-year period ended December 31, 1993.
  The U.S. Government defense market environment is one in which continued 
intense competition among defense contractors can be expected, especially in 
light of the shrinking defense budget. The Company's ability to successfully 
retain and compete for such business is highly dependent on its technical 
excellence, demonstrated management proficiency, strategic alliances, and 
cost-effective performance.
  Company-sponsored research and development not recoverable under contracts 
and charged directly to earnings as incurred amounted to $1,661 million, 
$1,846 million, and $1,417 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. In 
1994, research and development expense is projected to increase somewhat 
relative to 1993, principally in support of the 777, the 737-700, and other 
commercial jet transport programs and research.
  The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations 
designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials
into the environment. The Company believes its policies, practices and 
procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental
damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with
environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and
expenditures by the Company.  Compliance with environmental laws and 
regulations has not had in the past, and, the Company believes, will not have 
in the future, material effects on the capital expenditures, earnings, or
competitive position of the Company.
  The Company had approximately 123,000 employees at January 31, 1994, including
approximately 1,600 in Canada.
  Sales outside the United States (principally export sales from domestic 
operations) by geographic area are included on page 51 of the Company's 
1993 Annual Report to Shareholders and incorporated herein by reference. 
Less than 3% of total sales were derived from non-U.S. operations of the 
Company for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. 
Approximately 62% of the Company's contractual backlog at December 31, 1993, 
in terms of dollar value was with non-U.S. customers. Sales outside the 
United States are influenced by international relationships and U.S. 
Government foreign policy. Relative profitability is not significantly 
different from that experienced in the domestic market.
  Approximately 18% of accounts receivable and customer financing combined 
consisted of amounts due from customers outside the United States. These 
amounts are payable in U.S. dollars, and, in management's opinion, related 
risks are adequately covered by allowance for losses. The Company has not 
experienced materially adverse financial consequences as a result of sales 
and financing activities outside the United States.

  With the exception of the Glasgow Industrial Airport located in Glasgow, 
Montana, which is Company-owned, runways and taxiways used by the Company 
are located on airport properties owned by others and are used by the Company
jointly with others. The Company's rights to use such facilities are provided 
for under long-term leases with municipal, county or other government 
authorities. In addition, the U.S. Government furnishes the Company certain
office space, installations and equipment at Government bases for use in 
connection with various activities.
  Facilities at the principal locations support both major industry segments. 
Work related to a given program may be assigned to various locations, based 
upon periodic review of shop loads and production capability.
  During 1993, net additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $1,317 
million. Annual plant and equipment additions over the next two years are 
projected to be substantially below the 1993 expenditure level.
  The Company's properties are generally well maintained and in good operating 
condition. There are no significant unused facilities. Existing facilities 
are sufficient to meet the Company's near-term operating requirements.







                                6 of 109 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
  Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against the 
Company related to products, contracts and other matters. Except for the items 
discussed below, most of these legal proceedings are related to matters covered 
by insurance.
  In January 1991, the Company received from the U.S. Government a notice of 
partial termination for default which terminated most of the work required un-
der contracts to develop and install a new air defense system for Saudi Arabia,
known as the Peace Shield program. The Government has filed with the Company a 
demand for repayment of $605 million of Peace Shield unliquidated progress pay-
ments plus interest commencing January 25, 1991. In February 1991, the Company 
submitted a request for a deferred payment agreement which, if granted, would 
formally defer the Company's potential obligation to repay the $605 million of 
unliquidated progress payments until the conclusion of the appeal process. In 
June 1991, the Government selected another contractor to perform the work which
is the subject of the contracts that have been terminated for default, and the 
Government will likely assert claims related to the reprocurement. The Company 
does not expect the Government to assert such claims prior to completion of the 
reprocurement contract, which was originally scheduled for late 1995.
  Management's position, supported by outside legal counsel which specializes 
in government procurement law, is that the grounds for default asserted by the 
Government in the Peace Shield termination are not legally supportable. 
Accordingly, management and counsel are of the opinion that on appeal the 
termination for default has a substantial probability of being converted to 
termination for the convenience of the Government, which would eliminate any 
Government claim for cost of reprocurement or other damages. Additionally, the 
Company has a legal basis for a claim for equitable adjustment to the prices 
and schedules of the contracts (the "Contract Claim"). Many of the same facts 
underlie both the Contract Claim and the Company's appeal of the Government's 
termination action. The Company has filed its complaint in the United States 
Claims Court to overturn the default termination in order to obtain payment of 
the Contract Claim. The parties are currently litigating jurisdictional issues 
related to the complaint, and are engaged in discovery. Trial is currently 
scheduled for March 1997. The Company expects that its position will ultimately 
be upheld with respect to the termination action and that it will prevail on 
the Contract Claim.
  The Company's financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a 
conservative estimate of the revised values of the Peace Shield contracts 
including the Contract Claim and the Company's position that the termination 
was for the convenience of the Government. At this time, the Company cannot 
reasonably estimate the length of time that will be required to resolve the 
termination appeal and the Contract Claim. In the event that the Company's 
appeal of the termination for default is not successful, the Company could 
realize a pre-tax loss on the program approximating the value of the
unliquidated progress payments plus related interest and potential damages 
assessed by the Government.











                                7 of 109 

  The Company is subject to several U.S. Government investigations of business 
and cost classification practices. One investigation involves a grand jury 
proceeding as to whether or not certain costs were charged to the proper 
overhead accounts. No charges have been filed in this matter, and based on the 
facts known to it, the Company believes it would have defenses if any were 
filed. The investigations could result in civil, criminal or administrative 
proceedings. Such proceedings, if any, could involve claims by the Government 
for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or for-
feitures. Based upon Government procurement regulations, a contractor, or one
or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or 
debarred from Government contracts if proceedings result from the inves-
tigations. The Company believes, based upon all available information, that 
the outcome of Government investigations will not have a materially adverse 
effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
  The Company is subject to federal and state requirements for protection of 
the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and 
remediation of contaminated sites. Due in part to their complexity and 
pervasiveness, such requirements have resulted in the Company being involved 
with related legal proceedings, claims and remediation obligations over the 
past 10 years.
  The Company routinely assesses, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and
legal reviews, its contingencies, obligations and commitments for remediation 
of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of 
recoveries from other responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a 
settlement and recoveries from insurance carriers. The Company's policy is to 
immediately accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related 
to environmental remediation sites based on conservative estimates of 
investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred.
  The costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with such 
activities have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact to 
the Company's financial position. With respect to results of operations,
related charges have averaged less than 2% of annual net earnings.  Such 
accruals as of December 31, 1993, without consideration for the related 
contingent recoveries from insurance carriers, are less than 2% of total 
liabilities.
  Based on all known facts and expert analyses, the Company believes it is not 
reasonably likely that identified environmental contingencies will result in 
additional costs that would have a materially adverse impact to the Company's
financial position or operating results and cash flow trends.


Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

  There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the 
quarter ended December 31, 1993.

DEPRECIATION

  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over 
useful lives, principally on accelerated methods. Amortization of leasehold 
improvements is based on the shorter of the physical life of the improvements 
or the period of the lease. The asset lives used for depreciation computation 
are as follows:

                 Buildings and fixtures      5 to 45 years
                 Machinery and equipment     3 to 11 years

of 1993 and ended the year at 23 per month.  In early 1994, the 747 production 
rate was reduced from 5 to 3 per month.  Based on current production schedules, 
the 737 rate will be reduced from 10 to 8 1/2 per month in the fourth quarter 
of 1994, the 757 rate will be reduced from 5 to 4 per month in the first quarter
of 1995, the 767 rate will be increased from 3 to 4 per month in the first 
quarter of 1995, and the 747 rate will be reduced from 3 to 2 per month in 
January 1995.  Planned production rates will continue to be adjusted as 
necessary to match customer orders.  Production of the new 777 model is on 
schedule to support the flight test program starting in mid-1994, and production
activity will continue to build until initial deliveries begin in mid-1995.  
Commercial jet transport deliveries for 1994 are currently projected to be in 
the 260 range.  Commercial transportation sales trends are discussed further in 
the Commercial Aircraft Market Environment section on pages 29-32.

  Defense and space segment revenues were $4.4 billion for 1993, down from 
$5.4 billion and $5.8 billion for 1992 and 1991, respectively.  Reduced B-2 
bomber subcontract work was the major contributor to the lower sales in 1993.
Several program terminations that occurred in 1991 and 1992 contributed to the 
decline in sales in 1992 compared with 1991, partially offset by increased sales
in the B-2 program and the F-22 fighter aircraft program.  The Company's defense
and space business is broadly diversified, and no program other than B-2 
accounted for more than 10% of total 1991-1993 defense and space revenues.  
B-2 bomber subcontract work, which accounted for less than 20% of total 
1991-1993 defense and space business revenues, will continue to decline over 
the next few years.

  The principal contributors to 1993 defense and space sales included B-2 bomber
subcontract work, production and remanufacturing of CH-47 helicopters, F-22 
fighter aircraft engineering and manufacturing development activities, Space 
Station work packages, E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) updates, 
A-6 composite wing production (terminated for convenience by the Government 
during 1993), RAH-66 Comanche helicopter development activities, KC-135 tanker 
update modifications, V-22 Osprey tiltrotor transport development and test 
activities, Avenger air-defense system deliveries, and B-1B bomber avionics.  
U.S. Government classified projects also continued to contribute to defense and 
space segment revenues.  The Company's activities on the F-22, RAH-66 and V-22 
programs are under joint venture teaming arrangements with other companies.

  NASA's selection of Boeing Defense & Space Group as the prime contractor for 
the restructured Space Station program will result in an increase of 
approximately 10% in defense and space segment sales in 1994 compared with 1993,
based on current programs and schedules.  However, U.S. Government defense and 
space programs continue to be subject to funding constraints, and further 
program stretch-outs or curtailments are possible.  Defense and space sales 
trends are discussed further in the Defense and Space Market Environment 
section on page 32. 

  Based on current programs and schedules, the Company projects total 1994 
sales to be in the $21 billion range.  



EARNINGS
Net earnings for 1993 on a comparable basis with the prior two years were 
as follows:

(dollars in millions)                        1993        1992        1991
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Net earnings as reported                   $1,244        $552      $1,567

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Net earnings on a comparable basis         $1,244      $1,554      $1,497
=========================================================================

                               25 of 109 

  The Company elected to implement Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
(SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than 
Pensions," in the fourth quarter of 1992, resulting in the accrual of a 
cumulative adjustment for retiree health care costs for active employees.  The 
Company's previous practice was to accrue retiree health care liability upon 
an employee's retirement.  Although the new accounting standard results in a 
higher level of retiree health care costs being recognized, there is no impact 
on the Company's cash flow requirements as there are no current plans to fund 
the accrued obligation.

  The $310 million decrease in net earnings for 1993 compared to 1992, 
excluding the cumulative effect of the SFAS No. 106 accounting change, was 
primarily due to lower commercial aircraft sales, together with lower 
corporate investment income and continued high levels of research and 
development expenditures, principally for the new 777 jet transport program.  
These factors were partially offset by improved defense and space earnings 
despite lower sales, and increased income from customer financing.

  The $57 million increase in net earnings for 1992 compared to 1991, on a 
comparable basis adjusted for the SFAS No. 106 accounting change, was primarily
due to increased commercial aircraft sales and improved cost performance, 
particularly in the defense and space segment.  These factors were partially 
offset by higher research and development expense (principally increased 777 
program expenditures), lower corporate investment income and a higher effective
federal income tax rate.

  Net earnings for 1991 were $182 million higher than 1990 earnings, primarily
due to increased commercial aircraft sales, a lower defense and space segment 
operating loss and a lower effective federal income tax rate.  These factors
were partially offset by higher research and development expense (principally 
increased 777 program expenditures) and lower corporate investment income.

  The effective federal income tax rates were 31.7%, 31.1% and 28.9% for 1993, 
1992 and 1991, respectively.  Relative to the statutory rates, the lower 
effective tax rates for the three years were due primarily to tax-exempt income
benefits from export sales, and research and development benefits in 1991.  
(See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

  Essentially all of the Company's business is performed under contract, and 
therefore operating results trends are not significantly influenced by the 
effect of changing prices.  Additional information relating to sales and 
earnings contributions by business segment can be found in Note 14 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

  Although 1994 sales are projected to be lower than 1993 sales, operating 
profit margins, exclusive of research and development expenditures for new 
and derivative jet transport models, are expected to be substantially 
maintained through the efficiencies gained by process improvements in all 
aspects of the Company's operations.  However, because of the impact of 
commercial aircraft research and development expenditures discussed below 
together with the lower sales level, there will be a significant decline 
in net earnings as a percent of sales for 1994.  





                               26 of 109 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
  Research and development expenditures charged directly to earnings include 
design, developmental and related test activities for new and derivative 
commercial jet transports, other company-sponsored product development, 
and basic defense and space research and development not recoverable under 
U.S. Government flexibly priced contracts.

Research and development expensed:
[Graphic and image material item Number 3
 See appendix on page 107 for description.]

  The principal commercial developmental program during the 1991-1993 time 
period has been the new 777 wide-body twinjet.  Structural design activities 
on the 777 program peaked in 1992, resulting in the lower level of research 
and development charges in 1993 compared to 1992.  The 777 development program 
has now transitioned from primarily structural and systems design activities 
to primarily systems integration and test activities.  Flight testing will begin
in mid-1994, leading to initial deliveries in mid-1995.  The principal 
commercial developmental projects with significant expenditures in 1994 include 
the 777 base model, the extended-range version of the 777 for which deliveries 
begin in late 1996, initial structural design activities on the 737-700 for 
which deliveries begin in late 1997, and the freighter version of the 767 to be 
delivered in the fourth quarter of 1995.  The first freighter version of the 
747-400, in development since 1989, was delivered in the fourth quarter of 1993.

  The major developmental programs in the defense and space segment, funded 
principally under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, include Space Station 
work packages, F-22 fighter aircraft, V-22 Osprey tiltrotor transport and 
RAH-66 Comanche helicopter.

  The total amount of research and development expenditures charged to expense 
is projected to increase somewhat in 1994 from the $1.7 billion level in 1993. 



CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
  The Company remains strongly committed to continuous quality improvement in 
all aspects of its business and to maintaining a strong focus on customer needs,
including product capabilities, technology, in-service economics and product 
support.  Major long-term productivity gains are being aggressively pursued as 
substantial resources have been and will continue to be invested in training, 
restructuring of processes, technology, and organizational realignment.  















                               27 of 109 

  In connection with the 777 developmental program, such measures have included
early application of substantial resources for integrated product teams, design
interface with customer representatives, use of advanced three-dimensional 
digital product definition and digital pre-assembly computer applications, and 
increased use of automated manufacturing processes.  Although these measures 
have required significant current investments, substantial long-term benefits 
are anticipated from reductions in design changes, less rework, and improved 
quality of internally manufactured and supplier parts.  Major process 
improvements and promising pilot projects are also being pursued on other 
commercial and military programs to improve quality, reduce inventory and 
shorten cycle times. 


BACKLOG
Contractual backlog:
[Graphic and image material item Number 4
 See appendix on page 107 for description.]

  Total contractual backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 1993, was 
$73.5 billion, compared with $87.9 billion at the end of 1992.  Of the total 
1993 backlog, $70.5 billion or 96% was for commercial customers (including 
foreign governments) and $3.0 billion or 4% was for the U.S. Government.  
Comparable figures at the end of 1992 were $82.6 billion or 94% commercial, 
and $5.3 billion or 6% U.S. Government.  Not included in contractual backlog 
are purchase options and announced orders for which definitive contracts have 
not been executed and orders from customers which have filed for bankruptcy 
protection.

  U.S. Government and foreign military backlog is limited to amounts obligated
to contracts.  Unobligated U.S. Government contract values not included in 
backlog at December 31, 1993 and 1992, totaled $6.9 billion and $7.6 billion.

  In evaluating the Company's contractual backlog for commercial customers, 
certain risk factors should be considered.  Many of the orders extend out 
several years, with approximately 60% of the contractual backlog for commercial
jet airplanes scheduled to be delivered after 1995.  Continuation of the weak 
economic environment in many areas of the world could result in additional 
customer requests for rescheduling or possible cancellation of contractual 
orders.


COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT MARKET ENVIRONMENT
- --------------------------------------
  The worldwide market for commercial jet transports is predominantly driven
by long-term trends in airline passenger traffic.  The principal factors in 
long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth in developed and emerging
markets and political stability.  Demand for the Company's products is further
influenced by profitability of the airline industry, the globalization and 
consolidation of the industry, limitations of airport and air traffic control 
infrastructure, noise regulations, product development and strategy, and price 
and other competitive factors.






                               28 of 109 

PASSENGER TRAFFIC TRENDS
  Worldwide airline passenger traffic declined in 1991 - the first annual 
decline since the start of the jet era - due principally to the economic and 
political impacts of the Persian Gulf conflict.  Passenger traffic in 1992 was
approximately 8% higher than the depressed levels of 1991 for the airline 
industry worldwide, excluding Aeroflot of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States (CIS).  Relative to 1990 levels, 1992 worldwide airline passenger traffic
represented an increase of approximately 5%.  The growth in worldwide airline 
passenger traffic in 1993 over 1992 was approximately 3 1/2%.  For the three-
year period 1991-1993, the average annual growth rate for worldwide passenger 
traffic was approximately 3%, significantly below the long-term historical 
growth rate.  Worldwide economic growth rates in general were similarly below 
long-term historical averages during this period.

  Passenger traffic gains by U.S. airlines in 1992 were approximately 6 1/2%, 
largely due to aggressive price discounting that resulted in no revenue growth 
and significant operating losses in the aggregate.  In 1993 passenger traffic 
of U.S. carriers increased approximately 3 1/2%; however, revenue was up 
approximately 7%.  As a result, U.S. airlines realized an operating profit in 
the aggregate for 1993, in contrast to their significant operating losses in 
1992 and 1991.

  European airline passenger traffic increased approximately 8% in 1993, but 
revenue yields remained weak, reflecting current economic conditions.  With the
exception of Japan, which experienced no growth in airline passenger traffic in 
1993, Asia continues to experience high traffic growth.  Passenger traffic
growth in Asian countries other than Japan grew approximately 7% in 1993.

World air travel:
[Graphic and image material item Number 5
 See appendix on page 108 for description.]


  The above graph shows the growth in world air travel, excluding traffic of 
former Soviet Union airlines, as measured by revenue passenger miles from 
1970 through 1993, and the Company's forecast of world air travel through the 
year 2010.  The forecasted revenue passenger miles represent an average annual 
growth rate of somewhat over 5%, compared with the long-term historical annual 
growth rate of nearly 7% through 1993.  The forecasted average annual growth 
rate, although lower than the historical rate, results in greater annual 
increases in the absolute number of revenue passenger miles because of the 
growing volume to which the annual growth rates apply.

  Based on this long-term forecast of air traffic growth - taking into
consideration increasing utilization levels of the worldwide fleet and 
requirements to replace older aircraft - the Company estimates the total 
commercial jet transport market through the year 2010, including existing 
aircraft orders, at approximately $800 billion in 1994 dollars.  However, 
the realization of this market forecast under economically rational 
circumstances depends on the customer airlines' ability to achieve and sustain 
reasonable levels of profits over the long term.






                               29 of 109 

AIRLINE PROFITABILITY
  The domestic and international airline industry in aggregate achieved a 
general long-term growth trend of positive operating profits from 1970 through 
1989, although with significantly reduced operating profits or operating losses 
during the 1979-1983 period.  That long-term profitability trend has again been 
seriously disrupted, especially with respect to the major U.S. airlines.  From 
1990-1992, the U.S. airline industry incurred very substantial losses.  
Additionally, the major non-U.S. airlines experienced operating losses in the 
aggregate during 1992.  Through a combination of passenger traffic growth, 
improved revenue yields, lower fuel costs, aggressive cost reduction measures 
and other productivity improvements, both U.S. and non-U.S. airlines realized 
positive operating profits in 1993 in the aggregate.  Net profits, which include
interest expense on debt obligations, however, were negative for the fourth 
consecutive year for the U.S. airline industry.

  Until the airline industry can achieve sustained levels of acceptable 
profitability, future orders of the Company's commercial jet transports will be
restricted.  Many airlines have taken aggressive cost reduction measures, and 
the airline industry has continued to move toward more consolidation and 
integration of operations.  These actions, coupled with rational fare structures
and continued passenger traffic growth, are important factors in returning the 
airline industry to profitability and improved financial health.  

Airline industry profits - for core airline operations:
[Graphic and image material item Number 6
 See appendix on page 108 for description.]


INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS
  As all jet transport manufacturers face declining production rates, 
competitive pressures for new orders continue to be intense in terms of pricing
and other conditions.  With respect to pricing pressures, the Company's 
continuous quality improvement and cost reduction efforts are intended to enable
the Company to maintain market share at satisfactory margins.  

  In July 1992 the U.S. Government and the European Community announced 
agreement on interpreting the commercial aircraft code of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  The 1992 agreement limits direct European 
government development support subsidies to 33% and prohibits government 
production loans and government-subsidized sales arrangements.  While Boeing 
would have preferred a ban on all government subsidies for commercial airplane 
programs, the controls embodied in the 1992 agreement were considered important
in limiting future government support to the Company's European competitor.
A new multi-lateral subsidies code was incorporated in the GATT agreement 
reached in December 1993 limiting government subsidies by all countries 
covered by the GATT.  The more restrictive 1992 bilateral agreement remains in 
effect for the European Community.  Further limiting of government subsidies 
to foreign aircraft manufacturing companies remains a primary goal of Boeing 
to ensure fair competition.  








                               30 of 109 

  The aircraft manufacturing industry in the former Soviet Union (FSU) can 
be expected to capture the predominant share of the future FSU market, 
although current instability makes that market environment unpredictable.  
However, the Company believes the FSU market is large and diverse, and presents
significant sales opportunities over the longer term.  With regard to the 
commercial jet transport market outside the FSU, the FSU aircraft manufacturing 
industry, as well as those in certain Asian countries, has the potential of 
increasing competition, either independently or through alliances.  Although 
this represents an added degree of uncertainty, the Company believes it will 
be able to maintain its long-term favorable market share through its wide range 
of product offerings and technological improvements, its broad-based network of 
domestic and international suppliers and program participants, its extensive 
customer service system, opportunities for strategic alliances, and continued 
emphasis on quality and continuous process improvements.


WORLD AIRCRAFT FLEET
  Excess capacity in the worldwide aircraft fleet has contributed to the 
decline in sales and backlog.  Approximately 800 commercial jet transports on 
average were in storage status during 1993.  However, due to noise constraints 
and the inferior operating economics of older aircraft, only about one-half of 
the stored aircraft are expected to be put back into commercial service.  More 
than 70% of the inactive aircraft do not meet the Federal Aviation 
Administration's more stringent Stage III noise requirements and have an average
age of well over 20 years.  The average age of the inactive aircraft meeting 
Stage III noise requirements is approximately 10 years.  

  Nearly 40% of the 10,500 jet aircraft in the non-FSU worldwide commercial 
fleet do not meet noise requirements scheduled to come into effect by the end 
of the decade.  Compliance with the new requirements, where feasible, requires 
modifications to older aircraft.  The costs of these modifications, coupled 
with increasing maintenance costs and inferior operating economics associated 
with older aircraft, are projected to result in the retirement of up to 3,500 
commercial jet transports by the year 2010 and therefore create substantial 
new aircraft demand.  


PRODUCT OFFERINGS
  The Company continually evaluates opportunities to improve current models, 
and conducts ongoing marketplace assessments to ensure that its family of jet 
transports is well positioned to meet future requirements of the airline 
industry.  The fundamental strategy is to maintain a broad product line 
responsive to changing market conditions by maximizing commonality within and 
across the Boeing family of airplanes.  The Company expects to continue leading 
the industry in customer satisfaction by offering products that exhibit the 
highest standards of quality, safety, technical excellence, economic 
performance, and in-service support.

  The major focus of development activities over the past three years has been
the 777 wide-body twinjet which is scheduled to enter airline service in 
mid-1995.  The new 777 model is designed to meet airline requirements for an 
efficient, comfortable, high-capacity airplane to be used in domestic and 
intra-regional markets.  An extended-range version of the 777 is being offered 
for delivery in late 1996, and the aircraft could be further developed for 
greater capability, including additional range and a stretched fuselage.  
Orders for 147 and options for 108 777s had been announced by 16 customers as 
of year end 1993.
                               31 of 109 

  During 1993 the Company began development activities on the next generation 
of the 737 family of short-to-medium-range jetliners that will provide greater
range, increased speed, and reduced noise and emissions while maintaining 737 
family commonality.  The first next-generation 737, designated the 737-700, is 
the middle-sized member of the 737 family.  Customer orders will determine the 
sequence and timing of the introduction of the smaller 737-600 and the larger 
737-800.   Approximately 40% of the dollar value of the projected commercial 
jet transport deliveries through the year 2010 is expected to be in the size 
category that includes the 737 family.  The improved operational capabilities 
and commonality benefits should give the new 737s significant competitive 
advantages.  Initial 737-700 deliveries are scheduled for late 1997.

  Other derivatives recently developed or presently in development include the
freighter version of the 747-400, in development since 1989 and first delivered
in 1993, and the freighter version of the 767 for which deliveries begin 
in 1995.

  The Company continues to assess the market potential for new or derivative 
aircraft that are larger and have more range than the 747-400.  Because of a 
relatively limited market and the heavy resource investment levels required, 
the Company signed an agreement with four European aerospace companies in 1993 
to study the feasibility of developing a new aircraft capable of carrying 
between 550 and 800 passengers.  

  While product development activities are principally oriented toward 
maintaining and enhancing the competitiveness of the Boeing subsonic fleet, the 
Company is also involved in studies to understand the technological and 
economic issues associated with development of commercial supersonic aircraft.  
At this time, environmental issues such as takeoff noise and emissions at high 
altitude appear manageable.  


SUMMARY
  Although significant market uncertainties exist - especially with respect 
to near-term economic conditions, the airline industry's profitability and 
financial health, and the intense competitive environment - the long-term 
market outlook remains favorable.  The Company is well positioned in all 
segments of the commercial jet transport market, and intends to remain the 
airline industry's preferred supplier through emphasis on quality processes, 
customer satisfaction and product offerings.


DEFENSE AND SPACE MARKET ENVIRONMENT
- ------------------------------------
  Changing defense priorities and severe federal government budget pressures 
have significantly changed the market environment for the defense and space 
segment.  Over the three-year period 1991-1993, total U.S. Government defense 
and space funding declined approximately 20% in inflation-adjusted dollars, 
and further declines are projected over the next few years.  As a consequence, 
some of the Company's programs have been subject to stretch-out, curtailment 
or termination.  Although a number of programs remain subject to future 
stretch-out and curtailment, the Company's defense and space business is 
broadly diversified and includes a number of priority developmental programs 
and candidate programs for system upgrade or modification.  Internationally, 
defense budgets have also moderated; however, there continue to be opportunities
for the sale of Boeing systems to foreign governments.  

                               32 of 109 

  Major defense and space contract awards during 1993 included NASA's selection
of Boeing as the prime contractor for the restructured Space Station program, 
and the initial contract for two 767 Airborne Warning and Control Systems 
(AWACS) for the government of Japan.  The selection as prime contractor for 
the Space Station program is an acknowledgment of Boeing Defense & Space Group's
ability to effectively manage large, complex integration projects, and 
represents an assignment of great importance to both the Company and the 
country's manned space program.  Boeing will be responsible for the design, 
development, physical integration, test and launch preparation of the Space 
Station, as well as completing the original work package to build the habitat 
and laboratory modules.  The 767 AWACS program is expected to provide 
substantial business opportunities over the long term.  Japanese officials have
indicated they intend to seek funding for two additional 767 AWACS in 1994, 
and the Company continues to discuss 767 AWACS requirements with other 
countries.  In addition to the 767 AWACS, other longer-term defense and space 
business opportunities associated with the Company's commercial aircraft include
U.S. military airlift and tankers.  The Pentagon's Defense Acquisition Board is
presently evaluating potential future acquisition of commercial wide-body 
aircraft such as the 747 and 767 to supplement the military airlift fleet.

  A larger percentage of the Company's defense and space business was under 
cost-reimbursement-type contracts in 1993 compared to 1991 and 1992.  The 
current major developmental programs, principally the Space Station, F-22 
fighter, RAH-66 Comanche helicopter and V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, 
primarily involve cost-reimbursement-type contracts.

  In addition to the developmental programs mentioned above, the major 
revenue-producing programs for 1994 include production and remanufacturing 
of CH-47 helicopters, continuing B-2 bomber subcontract work, production 
of the Avenger air-defense system, updating and modifying various military 
aircraft and systems, 767 AWACS, other program support and classified project 
activities.  

  The current defense and space market is characterized by aggressive 
competition for the fewer opportunities that remain and significant 
restructuring throughout the industry in the form of consolidations, 
acquisitions, relocations and organizational realignment.  The Company 
continues to examine whether its long-term strategy is best pursued through 
internal means or through acquisitions, dispositions or alliances.  During 
1991 and 1992, a major organizational consolidation and restructuring of the 
Company's various defense and space divisions was accomplished, positioning 
the new Defense & Space Group to effectively compete in this new market 
environment.  Joint venture arrangements with other companies are expected to 
continue to be common for major developmental programs and the follow-on 
production activities.  Currently, the Company's activities in the F-22, V-22
and RAH-66 developmental programs are under joint venture arrangements.


OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
- -------------------------
  Other business activities include developing large-scale information systems
and conducting management services through Boeing Computer Services, principally
for government agencies.  An information systems contract to enhance the 
readiness of the Army Reserve and National Guard units is projected to be the 
single largest contributor to other business sales for the next few years.  In 
early 1993, the Company elected to discontinue its involvement with the U.S. 
Government's strategic petroleum reserve program.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
- -------------------------------
  The primary factors that affect the Company's investment requirements and 
liquidity position, other than operating results associated with current sales
activity, include the timing of new and derivative commercial jet transport 
programs which require both high developmental expenditures and initial 
inventory buildup; cyclical growth and expansion requirements; requirements to
provide customer financing assistance; and the timing of federal income tax 
payments.  


CASH FLOW SUMMARY

(a)  Cash flows from earnings as presented here are adjusted for non-cash 
charges for depreciation and retiree health care accruals.  The Company 
has not funded Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 retiree 
health care accruals and at this time has no plan to fund these accruals 
in the future.

(b)  Facilities and equipment expenditures were at historic highs during 
1991 and 1992, primarily in support of the new 777 program.  Additionally, 
productivity investments and facilities expansions in support of the record 
commercial production rate levels in the 1991-1992 time period contributed 
substantially to these capital asset expenditures.  Expenditures in 1993 were 
down sharply as the 777 program facilities expansions were substantially 
completed.  Facilities and equipment expenditures are projected to continue 
to decline over the next two years.

(c)  The reduction in gross inventory in 1991 was primarily attributable to 
defense and space activities.  During both 1992 and 1993, inventory balances on
the 737, 747, 757 and 767 commercial jet transport programs declined substan-
tially due to production rate reductions and improvements in production inven-
tory flow times, offset by substantial inventory and tooling buildup on the new
777 program.  Defense and space segment inventories also declined in 1993. Pri-
marily because of declining delivery rates, slower order activity, and program
buildup on the 777 program during 1992 and 1993, the ratio of commercial cus-
tomer advances to commercial gross inventory declined. Consequently, the reduc-
tions in commercial gross inventory were more than offset by reductions in cus-
tomer advances, resulting in a net cash requirement. With regard to defense and
space contract activity, the ratio of progress billings to gross inventory did 
not significantly change during this period. Inventory buildup for the 777 pro-
gram is projected to continue through mid-1995 when deliveries of the new 777 
begin, partially offset by further reductions on the other commercial programs.

(d)  Over the three-year period 1991-1993, changes in accounts receivable, 
accounts payable, other liabilities and deferred taxes required $0.3 billion 
in cash flows in the aggregate.  Reductions in customer advances in excess of
related costs of $0.9 billion over that three-year period represented the 
largest individual negative cash flow factor.  As of year end 1990, excess 
customer advances totaled $1.1 billion, primarily associated with commercial 
aircraft order activity, and have been declining since that time.  Offsetting 
this principal negative cash flow factor were the effects of reductions in 
accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable and other liabilities.  
Cash generated from reductions in accounts receivable totaled $0.4 billion, 
principally associated with U.S. Government contract activity in 1992.  
Increases in accounts payable and other liabilities provided $0.7 billion over 
the three-year period, primarily due to increased levels of lease and other 
deposits from customers.  

Federal income tax payments over the past several years have substantially 
exceeded the tax provisions on book income, due principally to certain tax 
law changes previously enacted, resulting in the acceleration of the 
recognition of taxable income related to long-term contracts and inventory 
costing.   Federal income tax payments for the 1994-1995 time period are 
projected to exceed income tax expense by approximately $1 billion as 
remaining contracts executed under prior tax regulations are completed.

(e) The increase in customer financing has been largely driven by the 
commercial aircraft market conditions discussed above.  The Company has 
outstanding commitments of approximately $4.0 billion to arrange or 
provide financing related to aircraft on order or under option.  However, 
not all these commitments are likely to be utilized.  The Company will 
sell a portion of customer financing assets from time to time when capital 
markets are favorable in order to maintain maximum capital resource 
flexibility.  Outstanding loans and commitments are secured by the underlying 
aircraft.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SUMMARY
  The $2.3 billion of long-term debt added over the prior three years is 
unsecured, with maturities ranging from 10 to 50 years.  Total borrowings 
as of year end 1993 amounted to 23% of total book capital (shareholders' 
equity plus borrowings), and the Company believes that it has substantial 
additional long-term borrowing capability.  A $3.0 billion revolving credit 
line agreement with a group of major banks remains available, but unused.

  In aggregate, cash and short-term investments are projected to decrease 
through mid-1995 due principally to the inventory buildup on the new 777 jet 
transport, customer financing commitments, and federal income tax payments.  
No additional debt issuances are anticipated at this time.

  The Company believes its internally generated liquidity, together with 
access to external capital resources, will be sufficient to satisfy existing 
commitments and plans, and to provide adequate financial flexibility to take 
advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise.

                            _______

CONTINGENT ITEMS
  As discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the U.S. 
Government has terminated for alleged default most of the work required under 
contracts for a new Saudi Arabia air defense system known as the Peace Shield
program.  The Government has demanded that the Company repay $605 million of 
Peace Shield unliquidated progress payments and has selected another contractor 
to perform the terminated work.  Management believes that the Government's 
grounds for default are not legally supportable, and on appeal the Government's
position will be overturned.  The Company has filed its complaint in the United
States Claims Court to overturn the default termination, submitted a Contract 
Claim for equitable adjustment to the contract prices and schedules, and 
requested that repayment of $605 million of unliquidated progress payments be 
deferred.  The Company's financial statements assume that the termination for 
default will be overturned and that the Contract Claim will be settled in the 
Company's favor.  If the Company's appeal of the termination for default is 
not successful, the Company could realize a pre-tax loss on the program 
approximating the value of the unliquidated progress payments plus related 
interest and potential damages.

  The Company continues to be subject to ongoing U.S. Government investigations
of business practices and cost classifications.  These proceedings could 
involve claims by the Government for damages, and under certain circumstances 
a contractor can be suspended or debarred from Government contracts.  The 
Company believes, based upon all available information, that the outcome of 
the Government investigations will not have a materially adverse effect on its 
financial position or results of operations.


                               36 of 109 

  The Company is subject to federal and state requirements for protection of 
the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and 
remediation of contaminated sites.  Due in part to their complexity and 
pervasiveness, such requirements have resulted in the Company being involved 
with related legal proceedings, claims and remediation obligations over the 
past 10 years.  The costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connection 
with such activities have not had, and are not expected to have, a material 
impact to the Company's financial position.  With respect to results of 
operations, related charges have averaged less than 2% of annual net earnings, 
and have not exceeded 3 1/2% in any given year.

  The Company routinely assesses, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses 
and legal reviews, its contingencies, obligations and commitments to clean up 
sites, including assessments of the probability of recoveries from other 
responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a settlement and recoveries 
from insurance carriers.  The Company's policy is to immediately recognize 
identified exposures related to environmental cleanup sites based on 
conservative estimates of investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs 
to be incurred.

  Based on all known facts and expert analyses, the Company believes it is 
not reasonably likely that identified environmental contingencies will result
in a materially adverse impact on the Company's financial position or 
operating results and cash flow trends.

                 Seattle, Washington
                 
                 
                 We have audited the accompanying consolidated
                 statements of financial position of The Boeing Company
                 and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
                 the related statements of net earnings and cash flows
                 for each of the three years in the period ended
                 December 31, 1993.  These financial statements are the
                 responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
                 responsibility is to express an opinion on these
                 financial statements based on our audits.
                 
                 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
                 accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require
                 that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
                 assurance about whether the financial statements are
                 free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
                 examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
                 amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
                 An audit also includes assessing the accounting
                 principles used and significant estimates made by
                 management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
                 statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
                 provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
                 
                 In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
                 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
                 position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries as of
                 December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
                 operations and their cash flows for each of the three
                 years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in
                 conformity with generally accepted accounting
                 principles.
                 
                 As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in
                 1992 the Company changed its method of accounting for
                 postretirement benefits other than pensions.

               THE BOEING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
                                
           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
          Years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991
           (Dollars in millions except per share data)



Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation

  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all sub-
sidiaries. Intercompany profits, transactions and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation.


Sales and other operating revenues

  Sales under commercial programs and U.S. Government and foreign military 
fixed-price contracts are generally recorded as deliveries are made. For 
certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over a long 
time period before deliveries begin, sales are recorded based upon attainment of
scheduled performance milestones. Sales under cost-reimbursement contracts are
recorded as costs are incurred and fees are earned. Certain U.S. Government 
contracts contain profit incentives based upon performance as compared to 
predetermined targets. Incentives based on cost are recorded currently. Other
incentives are included in revenues when awards or penalties are established,
or when amounts can reasonably be determined. Income associated with customer 
financing activities is included in sales and other operating revenues.


Inventories and cost of deliveries

  Inventoried costs on long-term commercial programs and U.S. Government and
foreign military contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling
costs, and applicable overhead. In addition, for U.S. Government fixed-price-
incentive contracts, inventoried costs include research and development and
general and administrative expenses estimated to be recoverable. Inventoried 
costs are generally reduced by the estimated average cost of deliveries.

  For mature commercial programs, average cost of deliveries is based on the
estimated total cost of units committed to production. For commercial programs
in the early production stages, average cost of deliveries is based on the 
estimated total cost of units representing what is believed to be a conservative
market projection. For U.S. Government and foreign military contracts, average 
cost of deliveries is based on the estimated total cost of contractual units. To
the extent the total of such costs is expected to exceed the total estimated
sales price, charges are made to current earnings to reduce inventoried costs 
to estimated realizable value.

  In accordance with industry practice, inventoried costs include amounts 
relating to programs and contracts with long production cycles, a portion of 
which is not expected to be realized within one year.



                               42 of 109 

  Commercial spare parts and general stock materials are stated at average cost
not in excess of realizable value.


Research and development, general and administrative expenses

  Research and development (including the Company-sponsored share of research 
and development activity conducted in connection with cost-share contracts) and 
general and administrative expenses are charged directly to earnings as incurred
except to the extent estimated to be directly recoverable under U.S. Government
flexibly priced contracts.

 
Interest expense

  Interest and debt expense is presented net of amounts capitalized. Interest 
expense is subject to capitalization as a construction-period cost of property,
plant and equipment and major commercial program tooling.


Postretirement benefits

  The Company's funding policy for pension plans is to contribute, at a minimum,
the statutorily required amount to an irrevocable trust. Benefits under the 
plans are generally based on years of credited service, age at retirement and 
average of last five years' earnings. The actuarial cost method used in 
determining the net periodic pension cost is the projected unit credit method.

  In the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company adopted retroactive to January 1, 
1992, the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," 
using the immediate recognition transition option. SFAS No. 106 requires accrual
of these benefits during an employee's service period. Prior to 1992, post-
retirement benefits consisting of retiree health care were accrued for eligible
retirees and qualifying dependents. The effect of the immediate recognition of
the transition obligation was a decrease to 1992 earnings on an after-tax basis
of $1,002, or $2.95 per share based on the annual average shares outstanding.
This accounting change increased 1992 pre-tax costs by $123. The retiree health 
care obligation is unfunded.


Taxes on income

  In 1992, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  Under the
asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, deferred income taxes 
are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis
and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. These deferred taxes are measured 
by the provisions of currently enacted tax laws. Because the Company had 
previously adopted SFAS No. 96, the adoption of SFAS No. 109 does not have a 
material effect on the Consolidated Statements of Net Earnings.

  State taxes on income, which are relatively minor in amount, are included in
general and administrative expense.



                               43 of 109 

Cash and short-term investments

  Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments such as
certificates of deposit, time deposits, treasury notes and other money market
instruments which generally have maturities of less than three months. Short-
term investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value.


Capital assets

  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over 
useful lives, principally by accelerated methods. Applicable interest costs are
capitalized with respect to plant and equipment additions.


Contingent stock repurchase commitment

  The Company has issued put options on 5,000,000 shares of its stock, 
exercisable on specific dates in 1994, giving another party the right to sell 
shares of Boeing stock to the Company at contractually specified prices. The 
balance of the temporary equity account is the amount the Company would be 
obligated to pay if all the put options were exercised. The proceeds from the
issuance of the put options were accounted for as paid-in capital.


Per share data

  Net earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number
of shares outstanding of 339,736,640, 340,217,888 and 343,355,917 for the years
ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. There is no material 
dilutive effect on net earnings per share due to common stock equivalents.


Note 2 - Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable at December 31 consisted of the following:

                                                              1993        1992
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amounts receivable under U.S. Government contracts          $1,182      $1,035

Accounts receivable from commercial and foreign 
 military customers                                            433         393
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            $1,615      $1,428
==============================================================================

  Accounts receivable included the following as of December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively: amounts not currently billable of $325 and $209 ($192 and $132 not
expected to be collected in one year) relating primarily to sales values 
recorded upon attainment of performance milestones that differ from contractual
billing milestones and withholds on U.S. Government contracts; $271 and $241 
($240 and $192 not expected to be collected in one year) relating to claims and 
other amounts on U.S. Government contracts subject to future settlement; and  
$57 and $33 of other receivables not expected to be collected in one year.


                               44 of 109 

Note 3 - Inventories

  Inventories at December 31, 1993 and 1992, consisted of $9,557 and $10,141 
relating to long-term commercial programs and U.S. Government and foreign 
military contracts, and $928 and $932 relating to commercial spare parts, 
general stock materials and other inventories. General and administrative 
and research and development expenses included in inventories represented 
approximately 1% of total inventories.

  All commercial jet transport programs except the 777 are being accounted for
as mature programs as described in Note 1. As of December 31, 1993, there were 
no significant deferred production costs not recoverable from existing firm 
orders. Inventory costs relating to long-term commercial jet transport programs 
included net unamortized tooling of $2,887 and $1,646 at December 31, 1993 and
1992; of these amounts, $2,299 and $867 related to the 777 program. For mature
commercial programs, substantially all of such costs will be amortized over 
existing firm orders.  For the 777 program, the number of units for determining 
production costs in excess of aggregate estimated average cost and over which
total tooling costs will be amortized and absorbed in cost of sales will be 
established when deliveries commence. As of January 24, 1994, 134 777s were 
under firm contract.

  Additionally, as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, inventory balances included  
$457 and $581 subject to claims or other uncertainties related to U.S. 
Government contracts, principally for the Peace Shield program.  (See Note 13.)

  Interest capitalized as construction-period tooling costs amounted to $50 
and $53 in 1993 and 1992.


Note 4 - Customer Financing

Long-term customer financing, less current portion, at December 31 consisted
of the following:

                                                              1993        1992 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes receivable                                            $1,396      $1,305 
Investment in sales-type/financing leases                      768         111 
Operating lease aircraft, at cost, less accumulated 
 depreciation of $220 and $168                                 895         720 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             3,059       2,136 
Less valuation allowance                                      (100)        (70)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            $2,959      $2,066
==============================================================================

  Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related asset, and
historically the Company has not experienced a problem in accessing such 
collateral. The operating lease aircraft category includes new and used jet and
commuter aircraft, spare engines and spare parts.





                               45 of 109 

Principal payments from notes receivable and sales-type/financing leases for the
next five years are as follows:

                 1994    1995    1996    1997    1998
                 ------------------------------------
                 $218    $377     $86     $46     $55
                 ====================================

  Certain notes currently bear interest at fixed rates of 7.9% to 10.3%, while
the remainder are at variable interest rates up to 1.75% above the prime rate.

  Sales and other operating revenues included interest income associated with 
notes receivable and sales-type/financing leases of $153, $57 and $46 for 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively.


Note 5 - Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following:

                                                              1993        1992
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Land                                                       $   397     $   399
Buildings                                                    5,286       4,193

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           $13,232     $12,293
==============================================================================

 Interest capitalized as construction-period property, plant and equipment costs
amounted to $100, $66 and $44 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.


Note 6 - Taxes on Income

  In 1992, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." State taxes
on income, which are relatively minor in amount, are included in general and 
administrative expense.

The provision for federal taxes on income consisted of the following:

Year ended December 31,                               1993      1992      1991 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============================================================================




                               46 of 109 

The provisions for federal taxes on income were less than those which result 
from application of the statutory corporate tax rates due to the following:

                                                      1993      1992      1991

==============================================================================

  The research benefit recognized in 1991 related to benefits earned in prior 
years.

The net deferred tax assets (liabilities) resulted from temporary tax
differences associated with the following:

Year ended December 31,                               1993      1992      1991

==============================================================================

  The temporary tax difference associated with inventory and long-term contract
methods of income recognition encompasses related costing differences, 
including timing and depreciation differences.

  A valuation allowance was not required due to the nature of and circumstances 
associated with the temporary tax differences.

  Income taxes have been settled with the Internal Revenue Service for all years
through 1978. It is the Company's position that adequate provision has been  
made for all amounts due for the years 1979 through 1993. Federal income tax  
payments and transfers were $908, $518 and $993 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, 
respectively.


Note 7 - Other Assets

Other assets at December 31 consisted of the following:
                                                              1993        1992

The pension provision included the following components:

==============================================================================

  The actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation at December 
31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, was determined using a weighted average 
discount rate of 7.25%, 8.25% and 8.25%, and a rate of increase in future 
compensation levels of 5.0%, 6.0% and 6.0%. The expected long-term rate of 
return on plan assets was 8.5% at December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991.







                               49 of 109 

  The pension plans have been amended to provide that, in the event there is a 
change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors
and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the 
plans first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and then any surplus will be used 
to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the post-
retirement medical and life insurance benefits in the Company's group insurance 
programs.

  Although the Company has no intention of doing so, should it terminate certain
of its pension plans under conditions where the plan's assets exceed the plan's 
obligations, the Company has an agreement with the Government whereby the 
Government is entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan's reverted 
assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under Government 
contracts. Also, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 imposes a 20% non-
deductible excise tax on the gross assets reverted if the Company establishes a
qualified replacement plan or amends the terminating plan to provide for 
benefit increases; otherwise, a 50% tax is applied. Any net amount retained by 
the Company is treated as taxable income.

  The Company has certain unfunded and partially funded plans with a projected
benefit obligation of $169 and $109; plan assets of $23 and $0; and unrecog-
nized prior service costs and actuarial losses of $70 and $46 as of December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively, based on actuarial assumptions consistent with the
funded plans. The net provision for the unfunded plans was $22 and $15 for 1993 
and 1992.

  The principal defined contribution plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k)
plans and a funded plan for unused sick leave. Under the terms of the Company-
sponsored 401(k) plans, eligible employees are allowed to contribute up to 12% 
of their base pay. The Company contributes amounts equal to 50% of the 
employee's contribution to a maximum of 4% of the employee's pay, subject to
statutory limitations. The provision for these defined contribution plans in 
1993, 1992 and 1991 was $213, $221 and $205, respectively.


Other postretirement benefits

  In the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company adopted retroactive to January 1,
1992, the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.  
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,"
using the immediate recognition transition option. SFAS No. 106 requires 
accrual of these benefits during an employee's service period. Prior to 1992,
postretirement benefits were accrued for eligible retirees upon retirement. The
Company's postretirement benefits other than pensions consist of health care  
coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Except for employees 
covered by the United Auto Workers bargaining agreement for whom lifetime 
benefits are provided, retiree health care is provided principally until age 
65. At January 1, 1992, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was
$1,819; however, $301 of this obligation had been previously accrued, resulting
in a pre-tax transition obligation adjustment of $1,518. The effect of the 
immediate recognition of the transition obligation was a decrease to first 
quarter 1992 net earnings of $1,002 and a deferred tax benefit of $516.




                               50 of 109 

The retiree health care cost provision was $230, $257 and $105 for 1993, 1992 
and 1991, respectively. The components of expense for 1993 and 1992 were as 
follows:

Year ended December 31,                                         1993      1992 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Service cost (current period attribution)                      $  92      $110
Interest accretion on accumulated postretirement benefit 
 obligation                                                      144       147
Net deferral and amortization of actuarial gains                  (6) 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net provision for retiree health care                           $230      $257
==============================================================================

  Benefit costs were calculated based on assumed cost growth for retiree health
care costs of a 12.0% annual rate for 1994, decreasing to a 5.25% annual growth 
rate by the year 2003. A 1% increase or decrease in the assumed annual trend  
rates would increase or decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit ob-
ligation by $218 and $227 as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, with a corresponding
effect on the postretirement benefit expense of $39 and $43 for 1993 and 1992.  
The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
was determined using a weighted average discount rate of 7.25% and 8.25%.

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31 consisted of 
the following components:

                                                              1993        1992

                               51 of 109 



 In July 1987, the Company adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan and declared a 
dividend distribution of one Right for each outstanding share of common stock.
Under certain conditions, each Right may be exercised to purchase one one-
hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a 
purchase price of $150, subject to adjustment. The Rights will be exercisable
only if a person or group has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, 20%
or more of the outstanding shares of common stock; following the commencement 
of a tender or exchange offer for 30% or more of such outstanding shares of

common stock; or after the Board of Directors of the Company declares any
person, alone or together with affiliates and associates, to be an Adverse
Person. If the Board of Directors declares an Adverse Person, or a person or 
group acquires more than 30% of the then outstanding shares of common stock 
(except pursuant to an offer which the independent Directors determine to be 
fair to and otherwise in the best interests of the Company and its share-
holders), each Right will entitle its holder to receive, upon exercise, common
stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the
Company) having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right. The
Company will be entitled to redeem the Rights at 5 cents per Right at any time
prior to the earlier of the expiration of the Rights in August 1997 or ten days
following the time that a person has acquired or obtained the right to acquire a
20% position. The Company may not redeem the Rights if the Board of Directors
has previously declared a person to be an Adverse Person. The Rights do not
have voting or dividend rights, and until they become exercisable, have no 
dilutive effect on the earnings of the Company.

  Changes in stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs), issued to
officers and other employees at exercise prices equal to market value of the
stock at grant date, consisted of the following:

Note 13 - Contingencies

  Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against the
Company related to products, contracts and other matters. Except for the items
discussed below, most of these legal proceedings are related to matters covered
by insurance.

  In January 1991, the Company received from the U.S. Government a notice of 
partial termination for default which terminated most of the work required under
contracts to develop and install a new air defense system for Saudi Arabia, 
known as the Peace Shield program. The Government has filed with the Company a 
demand for repayment of $605 of Peace Shield unliquidated progress payments
plus interest commencing January 25, 1991. In February 1991, the Company 
submitted a request for a deferred payment agreement which, if granted, would
formally defer the Company's potential obligation to repay the $605 of 
unliquidated progress payments until the conclusion of the appeal process.
In June 1991, the Government selected another contractor to perform the work 
which is the subject of the contracts that have been terminated for default, 
and the Government will likely assert claims related to the reprocurement.  
The Company does not expect the Government to assert such claims prior to
completion of the reprocurement contract, which was originally scheduled for 
late 1995.

  Management's position, supported by outside legal counsel which specializes
in government procurement law, is that the grounds for default asserted by the
Government in the Peace Shield termination are not legally supportable.  
Accordingly, management and counsel are of the opinion that on appeal the 
termination for default has a substantial probability of being converted to 
termination for the convenience of the Government, which would eliminate any 
Government claim for cost of reprocurement or other damages. Additionally, the 
Company has a legal basis for a claim for equitable adjustment to the prices
and schedules of the contracts (the "Contract  Claim"). Many of the same facts
underlie both the Contract Claim and the Company's appeal of the Government's 
termination action. The Company has filed its complaint in the United States 
Claims Court to overturn the default termination in order to obtain payment of 
the Contract Claim. The parties are currently litigating jurisdictional issues
related to the complaint, and are engaged in discovery. Trial is currently 
scheduled for March 1997. The Company expects that its position will ultimately
be upheld with respect to the termination action and that it will prevail on
the  Contract Claim.

  The Company's financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a 
conservative estimate of the revised values of the Peace Shield contracts
including the Contract Claim and the Company's position that the termination 
was for the convenience of the Government. At this time, the Company cannot 
reasonably estimate the length of time that will be required to resolve the
termination appeal and the Contract Claim. In the event that the Company's
appeal of the termination for default is not successful, the Company could
realize a pre-tax loss on the program approximating the value of the
unliquidated progress payments plus related interest and potential damages 
assessed by the Government.






                               54 of 109 

  The Company is subject to several U.S. Government investigations of business
and cost classification practices. One investigation involves a grand jury
proceeding as to whether or not certain costs were charged to the proper 
overhead accounts. No charges have been filed in this matter, and based on the 
facts known to it, the Company believes it would have defenses if any were 
filed.  The investigations could result in civil, criminal or administrative 
proceedings. Such proceedings, if any, could involve claims by the Government
for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or 
forfeitures. Based upon Government procurement regulations, a contractor, or
one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or
debarred from Government contracts if proceedings result from the inves-
tigations. The Company believes, based upon all available information, that the
outcome of Government investigations will not have a materially adverse effect
on its financial position or results of operations.

  The Company is subject to federal and state requirements for protection of
the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and 
remediation of contaminated sites. Due in part to their complexity and per-
vasiveness, such requirements have resulted in the Company being involved with
related legal proceedings, claims and remediation obligations over the past 10
years.

  The Company routinely assesses, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses 
and legal reviews, its contingencies, obligations and commitments for remedi-
ation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities
of recoveries from other responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a
settlement and recoveries from insurance carriers. The Company's policy is to 
immediately accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related
to environmental remediation sites based on conservative estimates of inves-
tigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred.

  The costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with such 
activities have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact to the
Company's financial position. With respect to results of operations, related 
charges have averaged less than 2% of annual net earnings. Such accruals as of
December 31, 1993, without consideration for the related contingent recoveries
from insurance carriers, are less than 2% of total liabilities.

  Based on all known facts and expert analyses, the Company believes it is not
reasonably likely that identified environmental contingencies will result in 
additional costs that would have a materially adverse impact to the Company's 
financial position or operating results and cash flow trends.

Note 15 - Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk


  The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in
the normal course of business, principally relating to customer financing
activities. Off-balance-sheet risk items include financing commitments, 
extensions of credit, credit guarantees, tax benefit transfers, foreign govern-
ment expropriation guarantees, interest rate swaps, and agreements with other
financing parties to participate in long-term receivables with interest rate
terms different from those of the related receivable.

  Irrevocable financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including 
options, scheduled for delivery through 2002 totaled $3,963 as of December 31, 
1993. The Company anticipates that not all of these commitments will be utilized
and that it will be able to arrange for third-party investors to assume a 
portion of the remaining commitments, if necessary.

  The Company's exposure to credit and market-related losses related to credit
guarantees, tax benefit transfers, and foreign government expropriation 
guarantees totaled $28 as of December 31, 1993.

  The Company has entered into interest rate swaps with third-party investors 
whereby the interest rate terms differ from those of the original receivable.
These interest rate swaps related to $458 of customer financing receivables as 
of December 31, 1993. In addition, participation in customer financing 
receivables by third-party investors with interest rate terms different from 
the original receivable totaled $83.


Note 16 - Significant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk


  Substantially all financial instruments are with commercial airline customers
and the U.S. Government. As of December 31, 1993, virtually all off-balance-
sheet financial instruments described in Note 15 related to commercial aircraft
customers. Of the $3,897 in accounts receivable and customer financing 
receivables included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, 
$2,583 related to commercial aircraft customers and $1,182 related to the U.S. 
Government. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related
asset, and historically, the Company has not experienced a problem in accessing
such collateral.

Note 17 - Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments


  The carrying values of cash equivalents and short-term investments are
representative of fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.

  Certain receivable balances will be collected over an extended period; 
consequently, the fair value of accounts receivable is estimated to be lower
than the carrying value by $60 and $50 as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, 
reflecting a discounted value due to deferred collection. The carrying value of
accounts payable is estimated to approximate fair value.

  There are generally no quoted market prices available for customer financing
notes receivable. The net fair value of such notes is estimated to approximate
the net carrying value based upon interest rates and risk-related rate spreads 
as of December 31, 1993.

  The carrying amount of long-term debt was $2,630 and $1,793 as of December 31,
1993 and 1992. The fair value of long-term debt, based on current market rates 
for debt of the same risk and maturities, was estimated at $2,870 and $1,880 as 
of December 31, 1993 and 1992. The Company's long-term debt, however, is 
generally not callable until maturity.

  With regard to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk, it is not 
practicable to estimate the fair value of future financing commitments, and all
other off-balance-sheet financial instruments are estimated to have only a 
nominal fair value. The terms and conditions reflected in the outstanding 
guarantees and commitments for financing assistance are not materially different
from those that would have been negotiated as of December 31, 1993.

ARTICLE I   Stockholders' Meetings

SECTION 1.  Annual Meetings.

The Annual Meeting of the stockholders shall be held on the last Monday in 
the month of April in each year, or, if that day be a legal holiday, on the

directors and the transaction of such other business as may come before the 
meeting.

SECTION 2.  Special Meetings.

A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Board 
of Directors, or by stockholders holding together at least twenty-five 
percent of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote, except as 
otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or any 
amendment thereto.

SECTION 3.  Place of Meeting.

All meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be held at such 
place or places within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to 
time be fixed by the Board of Directors or as shall be specified or fixed in 
the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof.

SECTION 4.  Notice of Meetings.

Except as otherwise required by statute and as set forth below, notice of 
each annual or special meeting of stockholders shall be given to each 
stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting not less than thirty 
nor more than sixty (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) days 
before the meeting date.  If the Corporation has an Interested Stockholder

each special meeting of stockholders shall be given to each stockholder of 
record entitled to vote at such meeting not less than fifty-five nor more 
than sixty (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) days before

provisions of these By-Laws, the Certificate of Incorporation, or the 
Delaware General Corporation Law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the 
person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time

the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not 
lawfully called or convened.

SECTION 6.  Quorum.

At all meetings of stockholders, except when otherwise provided by statute 
or by the Certificate of Incorporation or any amendment thereto, or by the 
By-Laws, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders 
of one-third of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall 
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; and except as otherwise 
provided by statute or rule of law, or by the Certificate of Incorporation 
or any amendment thereto, or by the By-Laws, the vote, in person or by 
proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares constituting such quorum 
shall be binding upon all stockholders of the Corporation.  In the absence 
of a quorum, a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and 
entitled to vote may adjourn any meeting, from time to time but not for a 
period of more than thirty days at any one time, until a quorum shall 
attend.  At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, 
any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the 
meeting as originally called.  Unless otherwise provided by statute, no 
notice of an adjourned meeting need be given.

SECTION 7.  Proxies.

7.1  Appointment.  Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of 
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing 
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such 
stockholder by proxy.  Such authorization may be accomplished by (a) the 
stockholder or such stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee, or 
agent executing a writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to 
such writing by any reasonable means, including facsimile signature, or (b) 
by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or 
other means of electronic transmission to the intended holder of the proxy 
or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service, or similar agent 
duly authorized by the intended proxy holder to receive such transmission;  
provided, that any such telegram, cablegram, or other electronic 
transmission must either set forth or be accompanied by information from 
which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram, or other electronic 
transmission was authorized by the stockholder.  Any copy, facsimile 
telecommunication, or other reliable reproduction of the writing or 
transmission by which a stockholder has authorized another person to act as 
proxy for such stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the 
original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the 
original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, 
facsimile telecommunication, or other reproduction shall be a complete 
reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

7.2  Delivery to Corporation; Duration.  A proxy shall be filed with the 
Secretary of the Corporation before or at the time of the meeting or the 
delivery to the Corporation of the consent to corporate action in writing.  
A proxy shall become invalid three years after the date of its execution, 
unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  A proxy with respect to a specified 
meeting shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any reconvened meeting 
following adjournment of such meeting but shall not be valid after the final 
adjournment thereof.

SECTION 8.  Inspectors of Election.

8.1  Appointment.  In advance of any meeting of stockholders, the Board of 
Directors of the Corporation shall appoint one or more persons to act as 
inspectors of election at such meeting and to make a written report thereof.  
The Board of Directors may designate one or more persons to serve as 
alternate inspectors to serve in place of any inspector who is unable or 
fails to act.  If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of 
stockholders, the chairman of such meeting shall appoint one or more persons 
to act as inspector of elections at such meeting.

8.2  Duties.  The inspectors shall:  (a) ascertain the number of shares of 
the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share; (b) 
determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies 
and ballots; (c) count all votes and ballots; (d) determine and retain for a 
reasonable period of time a record of the disposition of any challenges made 
to any determination by them; and (e) certify their determination of the 
number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of the votes and 
ballots.  Each inspector of election shall, before entering upon the 
discharge of his or her duties, take and sign an oath to faithfully execute 
the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best 
of his or her ability.  The inspectors of election may appoint or retain 
other persons or entities to assist them in the performance of their duties.

8.3  Determination of Proxy Validity.  The validity of any proxy or ballot 
executed for a meeting of stockholders shall be determined by the inspectors 
of election in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware 
General Corporation Law as then in effect.  In determining the validity of 
any proxy transmitted by telegram, cablegram, or other electronic 
transmission, the inspectors shall record in writing the information upon 
which they relied in making such determination.

SECTION 9.  Fixing the Record Date.

9.1  Meetings.  For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to 
notice of and to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment 
thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date 
shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is 
adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall be not fewer 
than thirty nor more than sixty (or the maximum number permitted by 
applicable law) days before the date of such meeting.  If the corporation 
has an Interested Stockholder as defined in Article EIGHTH of the 
Certificate of Incorporation, the record date for each special meeting of 
stockholders shall be not fewer than fifty-five nor more than sixty (or the 




                               66 of 109 

maximum number permitted by applicable law) days before the meeting date, 
unless the calling of such meeting is ratified by the affirmative vote of a 
majority of the Continuing Directors, as defined in Article EIGHTH of the 
Certificate of Incorporation.  If no record date is fixed by the Board of 
Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice 
of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of 
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if 
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day 
on which the meeting is held.  A determination of stockholders of record 
entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply 
to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of 
Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

9.2  Consent to Corporate Action Without a Meeting.  For the purpose of 
determining the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in 
writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, 
which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing 
the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall 
not be more than ten (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) 
days after the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is 
adopted by the Board of Directors.  If no record date has been fixed by the 
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to 
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior 
action by the Board of Directors is required by Chapter 1 of the Delaware 
General Corporation Law as now or hereafter amended, shall be the first date 
on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed 
to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered 
office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an 
officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the records of 
proceedings of meetings of stockholders.  Delivery made to the Corporation's 
registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, 
return receipt requested.  If no record date has been fixed by the Board of 
Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by Chapter 
1 of the Delaware General Corporation Law as now or hereafter amended, the 
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate 
action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the 
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior 
action.

9.3  Dividends, Distributions, and Other Rights.  For the purpose of 
determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or 
other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled 
to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of 
stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors 
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which 
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date 
shall be not more than sixty (or the maximum number permitted by applicable 
law) days prior to such action.  If no record date is fixed, the record date 
for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of 
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution 
relating thereto.






                               67 of 109 

9.4.  Voting List.  At least ten days before each meeting of stockholders, a 
complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting shall be 
made, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each 
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each 
stockholder.  This list shall be open to examination by any stockholder, for 
any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a 
period of ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city 
where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the 
notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the 
meeting is to be held.  The list shall also be produced and kept at such 
meeting for inspection by any stockholder who is present.

SECTION 10.  Action by Stockholders Without a Meeting.

Subject to the provisions of Article NINTH of the Certificate of 
Incorporation, any action which could be taken at any annual or special 
meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior 
notice, and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting 
forth the action so taken, are (a) signed by the holders of outstanding 
stock having not fewer than the minimum number of votes that would be 
necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares 
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and (b) delivered to the 
Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, 
its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation 
having custody of the records of proceedings of meetings of stockholders.  
Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by 
certified mail or registered mail, return receipt requested.  Every written 
consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the 
consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate 
action referred to therein unless written consents signed by a sufficient 
number of stockholders to take such action are delivered to the Corporation, 
in the manner required by this section, within sixty (or the maximum number 
permitted by applicable law) days of the date of the earliest dated consent 
delivered to the Corporation in the manner required by this section.  The 
validity of any consent executed by a proxy for a stockholder pursuant to a 
telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission transmitted 
to such proxy holder by or upon the authorization of the stockholder shall 
be determined by or at the direction of the Secretary of the Corporation.  A 
written record of the information upon which the person making such 
determination relied shall be made and kept in the records of the 
proceedings of the stockholders.  Any such consent shall be inserted in the 
minute book as if it were the minutes of a meeting of the stockholders.  
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by 
less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who 
have not consented in writing.

SECTION 11.  Business for Stockholders' Meetings.

11.1  Business at Annual Meetings.  In addition to the election of 
directors, other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting of 
stockholders, provided that such business is properly brought before such 
meeting.  To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be 
(a) brought by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (b) brought 
before the meeting by a stockholder pursuant to written notice thereof, in 
accordance with Section 12 of this Article I, and received by the Secretary 


                               68 of 109 

not fewer than sixty nor more than ninety days prior to the date specified 
in Section 1 of this Article I for such annual meeting.  Any such 
stockholder notice shall set forth (i) the name and address of the 
stockholder proposing such business; (ii) a representation that the 
stockholder is entitled to vote at such meeting and a statement of the 
number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the 
stockholder; (iii) a representation that the stockholder intends to appear 
in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business; and (iv) as 
to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief 
description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the 
reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, the language of the 
business matter (if appropriate), and any material interest of the 
stockholder in such business.  No business shall be conducted at any annual 
meeting of stockholders except in accordance with this Section 11.1.  If the 
facts warrant, the Board of Directors, or the chairman of an annual meeting 
of stockholders, shall determine and declare (a) that a proposal does not 
constitute proper business to be transacted at the meeting or (b) that 
business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the 
provisions of this Section 11.1 and, if, in either case, it is so 
determined, any such business shall not be transacted.  The procedures set 
forth in this Section 11.1 for business to be properly brought before an 
annual meeting by a stockholder are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the 
requirements set forth in Rule 14a-8 under Section 14 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, or any successor provision.

11.2  Business at Special Meetings.  At any special meeting of the 
stockholders, only such business as is specified in the notice of such 
special meeting given by or at the direction of the person or persons 
calling such meeting, in accordance with Section 2 of this Article I, shall 
come before such meeting.

SECTION 12.  Notice to Corporation.

Any written notice required to be delivered by a stockholder to the 
Corporation pursuant to Section 11.1 of this Article I or Section 2.1 of 
Article II must be given, either by personal delivery or by registered or 
certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary at the Corporation's 
executive offices in the City of Seattle, State of Washington.

ARTICLE II   Board of Directors

SECTION 1.  Number and Term of Office.

 The number of directors shall be thirteen, but the number may be increased, 
or decreased to not less than three, from time to time, either by the 
directors by adoption of a resolution to such effect or by the stockholders 
by amendment of the By-Laws in accordance with Article VIII hereof.  The 
directors shall be divided into three classes, each of which shall be 
composed as nearly as possible of one-third of the directors.  Each director 
shall serve for the term to which the director was elected, and until a 
successor shall have been elected and qualified or until the director's 
prior death, resignation, or removal.  At each annual election, directors 
shall be chosen for a full three-year term to succeed those whose terms 
expire.



                               69 of 109 

SECTION 2.  Nomination and Election.

2.1       Nomination.  Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the 
following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors.  
Nominations for the election of directors may be made (a) by or at the 
direction of the Board of Directors, or (b) by any stockholder of record 
entitled to vote for the election of directors at such meeting; provided, 
however, that a stockholder may nominate persons for election as directors 
only if written notice (in accordance with Section 12 of Article I) of such 
stockholder's intention to make such nominations is received by the 
Secretary not later than (i) with respect to an election to be held at an 
annual meeting of the stockholders, not fewer than sixty nor more than 
ninety days prior to the date specified in Section 1 of Article I for such 
annual meeting, and (ii) with respect to an election to be held at a special 
meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors, the close of 
business on the seventh business day following the date on which notice of 
such meeting is first given to stockholders.  Any such stockholders' notice 
shall set forth (a) the name and address of the stockholder who intends to 
make a nomination; (b) a representation that the stockholder is entitled to 
vote at such meeting and a statement of the number of shares of the 
Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder; (c) a 
representation that the stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy 
at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; 
(d) as to each person the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or 
re-election as a director, the name and address of such person and such 
other information regarding such nominee as would be required in a proxy 
statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission had such nominee been nominated by the Board of Directors, and a 
description of any arrangements or understandings, between the stockholder 
and such nominee and any other persons (including their names), pursuant to 
which the nomination is to be made; and (e) the consent of each such nominee 
to serve as a director if elected.  If the facts warrant, the Board of 
Directors, or the chairman of a stockholders meeting at which directors are 
to be elected, shall determine and declare that a nomination was not made in 
accordance with the foregoing procedure and, if it is so determined, the 
defective nomination shall be disregarded.  The right of stockholders to 
make nominations pursuant to the foregoing procedure is subject to the 
rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference 
over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation.  The procedures 
set forth in this Section 2.1 for nomination for the election of directors 
by stockholders are in addition to, and not in lieu or limitation of, (a) 
any procedures now in effect or hereafter adopted by or at the direction of 
the Board of Directors or any committee thereof and (b) the requirements set 
forth in Rule 14a-11 under Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, or any successor provision.

2.2  Election.  At each election of directors, the persons receiving the 
greatest number of votes shall be the directors.

SECTION 3.  Place of Meeting.

Meetings of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be held 
either within or without the State of Delaware.




                               70 of 109 

SECTION 4.  Annual Meeting.

Each year the Board of Directors shall meet in connection with the annual 
meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing officers and for the 
transaction of other business.  No notice of such meeting is required.  Such 
annual meeting may be held at any other time or place which shall be 
specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of 
the Board, or in a consent and waiver of notice thereof, signed by all the 
directors.

SECTION 5.  Stated Meetings.

The Board of Directors may, by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of a 
majority of the whole Board, from time to time appoint the time and place 
for holding stated meetings of the Board, if by it deemed advisable; and 
such stated meetings shall thereupon be held at the time and place so 
appointed, without the giving of any special notice with regard thereto.  In 
case the day appointed for a stated meeting shall fall upon a legal holiday, 
such meeting shall be held on the next following day, not a legal holiday, 
at the regularly appointed hour.  Except as otherwise provided in the By-
Laws, any and all business may be transacted at any stated meeting.

SECTION 6.  Special Meetings.

6.1  Convenors and Notice.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors may 
be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board or any two 
directors.  Notice of a special meeting of the Board of Directors, stating 
the place, day, and hour of the meeting, shall be given to each director in 
writing (by mail, wire, facsimile, or personal delivery) or orally (by 
telephone or in person).

6.2  Waiver of Notice.  With respect to a special meeting of the Board of 
Directors, a written waiver, signed by a director, shall be deemed 
equivalent to notice to that director.  A director's attendance at a meeting 
shall constitute that director's waiver of notice of such meeting, except 
when the director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at 
the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the 
meeting was not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be 
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the 
Board of Directors need be specified in the waiver of notice of such 
meeting.

SECTION 7.  Quorum and Manner of Acting.

Except as herein otherwise provided, forty percent of the total number of 
directors fixed by or in the manner provided in these By-Laws at the time of 
any stated or special meeting of the Board or, if vacancies exist on the 
Board of Directors, forty percent of such number of directors then in 
office, provided, however, that such number may not be less than one-third 
of the total number of directors fixed by or in the manner provided in these 
By-Laws, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; and, 
except as otherwise required by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation 
or any amendment thereto, or by the By-Laws, the act of a majority of the 
directors present at any such meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the
act of the Board of Directors.  In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the 
directors present may adjourn any meeting, from time to time, until a quorum is 
present.  No notice of any adjourned meeting need be given.
                               71 of 109

The Chairman of the Board shall preside, when present, at all meetings of 
the Board, except as otherwise provided by law.

SECTION 9.  Resignations.

Any director of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written 
notice thereof to the Secretary.  Such resignation shall take effect at the 
time specified therefor or if the time is not specified, upon delivery 
thereof; and, unless otherwise specified with respect thereto, the 
acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

SECTION 10.  Removal of Directors.

Any director may be removed solely for cause by the affirmative vote of the 
holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled 
to vote, at a meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose; and the 
vacancy on the Board caused by any such removal may be filled by the 
stockholders at such meeting or at any subsequent meeting.

SECTION 11.  Filling of Vacancies Not Caused by Removal.

In case of any increase in the number of directors, or of any vacancy 
created by death or resignation, the additional director or directors may be 
elected or, as the case may be, the vacancy or vacancies may be filled, 
either (a) by the Board of Directors at any meeting, (i) if the Corporation 
has an Interested Stockholder as defined in Article EIGHTH of the 
Certificate of Incorporation, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the 
Continuing Directors, as defined in Article EIGHTH, or (ii) if the 
Corporation does not have an Interested Stockholder, by the affirmative vote 
of a majority of the remaining directors, though less than a quorum; or (b) 
by the stockholders entitled to vote, either at an annual meeting or at a 
special meeting thereof called for the purpose, by the affirmative vote of a 
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at such meeting.

SECTION 12.  Directors' Fees.

The Board of Directors shall have authority to determine from time to time 
the amount of compensation which shall be paid to its members for attendance 
at meetings of the Board or of any committee of the Board.

SECTION 13.  Action Without a Meeting.  Any action required or permitted to 

be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof 
may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as 
the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are 
filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee.

the scope and results of the annual independent audit of books and records 
of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, to review compliance with all 
corporate policies which have been approved by the Board of Directors, and

            of the Corporation other than in the usual and regular course of 
            business,

       (g)  authorize the issuance of stock.
The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate

constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of 
Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or 
disqualified member.

SECTION 3.  Quorum and Manner of Acting.

A majority of the number of directors composing any committee of the Board 
of Directors, as established and fixed by resolution of the Board of 
Directors, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any

meeting, a majority of such directors present may adjourn the meeting from 
time to time without further notice. The act of a majority of the members of 
a committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the 
act of such committee.

ARTICLE VI   Stock and Transfers of Stock

SECTION 1.  Stock Certificates.

Every stockholder shall be entitled to a certificate, signed by the Chairman 
of the Board or the President or a Vice President and the Treasurer or an 
Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, certifying 
the number of shares owned by the stockholder in the Corporation.  Any and 
all of the signatures on a certificate may be a facsimile.  If any officer, 
transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has 
been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, 
transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be 
issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such 
officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of issue.

SECTION 2.  Transfer Agents and Registrars.

The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, appoint responsible banks or 
trust companies in the Borough of Manhattan, in the City of New York, State 
of New York, and in such other city or cities as the Board may deem 
advisable, from time to time, to act as transfer agents and registrars of 
the stock of the Corporation; and, when such appointments shall have been 
made, no stock certificate shall be valid until countersigned by one of such 
transfer agents and registered by one of such registrars.

SECTION 3.  Transfers of Stock.

Shares of stock may be transferred by delivery of the certificates therefor, 
accompanied either by an assignment in writing on the back of the 
certificates or by written power of attorney to sell, assign, and transfer 
the same, signed by the record holder thereof; but no transfer shall affect 
the right of the Corporation to pay any dividend upon the stock to the 
holder of record thereof, or to treat the holder of record as the holder in 
fact thereof for all purposes, and no transfer shall be valid, except 
between the parties thereto, until such transfer shall have been made upon 
the books of the Corporation.

SECTION 4.  Lost Certificates.

The Board of Directors may provide for the issuance of new certificates of 
stock to replace certificates of stock lost, stolen, mutilated, or 
destroyed, or alleged to be lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed, upon such

deem proper and prescribe.

ARTICLE VII

                               77 of 109 

SECTION 3.  Signing of Negotiable Instruments.

All bills, notes, checks, or other instruments for the payment of money 
shall be signed or countersigned by such officer or officers and in such 
manner as from time to time may be prescribed by resolution (whether general 
or special) of the Board of Directors.

SECTION 4.  Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

4.1  Right to Indemnification.  Each person who was or is made a party or is 
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including, 
without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit, 
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative 
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was 
a director or officer of the Corporation or that, being or having been such 
a director or officer or an employee of the Corporation, he or she is or was 
serving at the request of an executive officer of the Corporation as a 
director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation or of a 
partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service 
with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), 
whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official 
capacity as such a director, officer, employee, or agent or in any other 
capacity while serving as such a director, officer, employee, or agent, 
shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the full extent 
permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may 
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the 
extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader 
indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), or by other applicable 
law as then in effect, against all expense, liability, and loss (including 
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and 
amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by 
such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall 
continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, 
employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, 
executors, and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in 
Section 4.2 with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to 
indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in 
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee 
only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or ratified by the 
Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification 
conferred in this Section 4.1 shall be a contract right and shall include 
the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending 
any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an 
"advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that an advancement of 
expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his her capacity as a director or 
officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered 
by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee 
benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an 
undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such 
indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be 
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right 
to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such 
expenses under this Section 4.1 or otherwise; and provided, further, that an 
advancement of expenses shall not be made if the Corporation's Board of 
Directors makes a good faith determination that such payment would violate 
law or public policy.

                               78 of 109 

4.2  Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit.  If a claim under Section 4.1 is not 
paid in full by the Corporation within sixty days after a written claim has 
been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an 
advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty 
days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the 
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.  If successful in 
whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation 
to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an 
undertaking, the indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of 
prosecuting or defending such suit.  The indemnitee shall be presumed to be 
entitled to indemnification under this Section 4 upon submission of a 
written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for an 
advancement of expenses, where the required undertaking has been tendered to 
the Corporation), and thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of 
proof to overcome the presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled.  
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, 
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination 
prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the 
indemnitee is proper in the circumstances, nor an actual determination by 
the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal 
counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee is not entitled to 
indemnification shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that 
the indemnitee is not so entitled. 

4.3  Nonexclusivity of Rights.  The rights to indemnification and to the 
advancement of expenses conferred in this Section 4 shall not be exclusive 
of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any 
statute, provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, agreement, 
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.  
Notwithstanding any amendment to or repeal of this Section 4, or of any of 
the procedures established by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 
4.7, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with 
the provisions hereof and thereof with respect to any acts or omissions of 
such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

4.4  Insurance, Contracts, and Funding.
The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself 
and any director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation or another 
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against 
any expense, liability, or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have 
the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability, or loss 
under the Delaware General Corporation Law.  The Corporation may, without 
further stockholder approval, enter into contracts with any indemnitee in 
furtherance of the provisions of this Section 4 and may create a trust fund, 
grant a security interest, or use other means (including, without 
limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may 
be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Section 4.

4.5  Persons Serving Other Entities.  Any person who is or was a director, of-
ficer, or employee of the Corporation who is or was serving (i) as a director or
officer of another corporation of which a majority of the shares entitled to 
vote in the election of its directors is held by the Corporation or (ii) in an 
executive or management capacity in a partnership, joint venture, trust, or 
other enterprise of which the Corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
Corporation is a general partner or has a majority ownership shall be deemed to
be so serving at the request of an executive officer of the Corporation and 
entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses under Section 4.1.
                               79 of 109 

4.6  Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation.  The 
Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, authorize one or more 
executive officers to grant rights to advancement of expenses to employees 
or agents of the Corporation on such terms and conditions as such officer or 
officers deem appropriate under the circumstances.  The Corporation may, by 
action of its Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and 
advancement of expenses to employees or agents or groups of employees or 
agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the provisions 
of this Section 4 with respect to the indemnification and advancement of 
expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation; provided, however, 
that an undertaking shall be made by an employee or agent only if required 
by the Board of Directors.

4.7  Procedures for the Submission of Claims.  The Board of Directors may 
establish reasonable procedures for the submission of claims for 
indemnification pursuant to this Section 4, determination of the entitlement 
of any person thereto, and review of any such determination.  Such 
procedures shall be set forth in an appendix to these By-Laws and shall be 
deemed for all purposes to be a part hereof.

                                 Exhibit (10)(vii)

                     Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees
                 of The Boeing Company as amended October 25, 1993











































                               82 of 109 




                    DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR
                    EMPLOYEES OF THE BOEING COMPANY

1.   Purpose.  The purpose of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees of 
The Boeing Company (the "Plan") is to provide for deferment of payment 
of all or a portion of awards made to an employee under the Company's 
Incentive Compensation and Performance Award Plans.

2.   Eligibility.  Any employee eligible to receive an award under the 
Incentive Compensation Plan or the Performance Award Plan is eligible to 
elect to participate in this Plan.

3.   Election to Participate.  An eligible employee may elect to defer awards 
made thereafter, by executing and delivering to the Company a notice 
which shall state the percentage of the award to be deferred, and the 
method for crediting investment earnings on deferred amounts.
An election to participate will remain in effect until participation in 
the Plan terminates, or until the election is changed by a notice to the 
Company increasing or decreasing the percentage of future awards to be 
deferred, or changing the method for crediting investment earnings on 
future deferrals.

An election or change in election must be made by December 1 to be 
effective for an award made under the Incentive Compensation Plan in the 
following year, and by on or before December 1 of the year preceding the 
year in which the service is performed for which a Participant may earn 
an award under the Performance Award Plan.

If a Participant terminates participation in this Plan, all amounts 
accumulated in the Participant's account prior to termination will 
continue to be held subject to the Plan.

For purposes of the Plan, a "Participant" means an employee or former 
employee having an account under the Plan.

4.   Earnings Credits on Deferred Amounts.  All amounts deferred under the 
Plan shall be credited to the Participant's Plan account at the time an 
award is made.

Each account shall be credited with earnings thereon, under the Interest 
Credit method or the Stock Unit method, at the election of the 
Participant, such election to be irrevocable once made.  In the absence 
of an election, the Interest Credit method shall be used.

Interest Credit Method.  As of March 31, June 30, September 30, and 
December 31 each year, a Participant's account shall be credited with 
interest on all amounts in that account during the preceding quarter.
Interest will be computed during each calendar year at the mean between 
the high and the low during the first eleven months of the preceding 
year of yields on Aa-rated Industrial Bonds as reported by Moody's 
Investors Service, Inc., rounded to the nearest 1/4th of one percent.  
The Company will notify Participants annually of the established 
interest rate.

                               83 of 109 

Stock Unit Method.  At the time an award is made, the Participant's 
Stock Unit account shall be credited with the number of shares of the 
Company's common stock that could be purchased with the award, based on 
the Fair Market Value of such stock on the day of the award (or on the 
next business day on which the Exchange is open, if the Exchange is 
closed on the day of the award) excluding commissions, taxes, and other 
charges; and such number (carried to two decimal places) shall be 
recorded as stock units in the Participant's account, for bookkeeping 
purposes only.  For purposes of the Plan, "Fair Market Value" equals the 
mean of the high and low per share trading prices for the common stock 
of the Company as reported in The Wall Street Journal for the "New York 
Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions" for a single trading day.  The 
number of stock units in an account shall be appropriately adjusted to 
reflect stock splits, stock dividends, and other like adjustments in the 
Company's common stock.

Each Participant's Stock Unit account periodically shall be credited 
with the number of shares of the Company's common stock that could be 
purchased, as set forth in the preceding paragraph, by an amount equal 
to the cash dividends that would be payable on the number of shares of 
the Company's common stock that equals the number of stock units in a 
Participant's Stock Unit account.  The Company will notify Participants 
annually of the number of stock units, and the dividend equivalents, 
credited to their Stock Unit account.

The Committee may authorize an irrevocable one-time election by 
Participants, to elect the Stock Unit method for Plan balances as of 
December 31, 1993.

5.   Payment.  The timing and manner of distribution of amounts held under 
the Plan shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, 
but distributions shall commence no later than the January 15 
immediately following the year in which the Participant reaches age 
70-1/2.  For Participants subject to Section 16 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder ("Section 
16"), distributions shall commence no earlier than as set forth in this 
section.  A Participant may submit an election to the Committee, stating 
the number of years over which the Participant requests that payment be 
made (which shall be between 1 and 15 years), the initial year of 
payment , and the payment option (in the case of payments to be made 
over 2 or more years).  The election shall be submitted to the Committee 
by not later than December 1 of the year following the year of 
termination of the Participant's employment by the Company.  
Distributions shall be made in accordance with the election unless the 
Committee determines that the distribution should be made at some 
different time or in some different manner.

The payment options (in the case of payments to be made over 2 or more 
years) shall be as follows:

    Approximately Equal Option.  The amount payable to the Participant 
each year shall be computed by the Company so that the aggregate 
amount of cash or stock in a Participant's account under the Plan 
shall be distributed in approximately equal installments in each 
year for which deferred compensation payments are to be made; or


                               84 of 109 

    Fractional Option.  The amount payable to the Participant each 
year shall be computed by multiplying a fraction, the numerator of 
which is one and the denominator of which is the number of years 
remaining in the distribution period, by the balance in the 
account on January 1 of such year.
Under either option, the Participant's account shall be debited at the 
time of payment, which shall be on or before January 15 of each year.
An approved payment period and payment option shall be applicable to the 
Participant's total aggregate deferred compensation accounts under the 
Plan, including any accounts previously maintained that have been 
combined into an account under this Plan.  Participants who have filed 
elections prior to January 1, 1993, may by December 1, 1993, revise such 
elections (subject to Committee approval) to reflect the payment periods 
and payment options permitted by the foregoing provisions, or may cancel 
such elections and defer making an election until such time as is 
permitted by the foregoing provisions.

Distributions from a Participant's Stock Unit account shall be paid in 
cash.  Following a Participant's termination of employment (or for 
Participants subject to Section 16 , following the period the 
Participant is so subject and for any required Section 16 reporting 
period thereafter), distributions may be made in stock at the written 
election of the Participant, subject to Committee approval.   The cash 
distribution shall equal the cash value, on the date as of which the 
distribution is calculated (which shall be the first business day in 
January unless some other date is prescribed by the Committee), of the 
number of whole shares of Company common stock then distributable to 
such Participant, based on the Fair Market Value of such stock on that 
date, or the next day on which the Exchange is open, if the Exchange is 
closed on the date the distribution is calculated.  Any distribution in 
stock shall be in whole shares of the Company's common stock equal in 
number to the whole number of stock units credited to the Participant's 
account under the Stock Unit method.  No fractional shares shall be 
distributed and any account balance remaining after a stock distribution 
shall be paid in cash. 

Except as provided below with respect to the Stock Unit accounts of 
Participants subject to Section 16, a Participant may request that 
amounts credited to his account under the Plan be distributed prior to 
the termination of his employment with the Company, or that an approved 
method of payment of his Plan account be changed.  Any such request 
shall set forth the reason therefor, and is subject to approval by the 
Committee in its sole and absolute discretion.  Any request for a 
distribution prior to termination of employment must be submitted to the 
Committee by no later than December 1 of the year prior to the year in 
which the distribution is requested to be made.  No request for 
distribution prior to termination of employment will be approved if the 
Participant also has elected to defer any portion of an award under the 
Company's Incentive Compensation or Performance Award Plans to be made 
in the calendar year in which the requested distribution is to be made.  
A Participant may request that any or all amounts accumulated under this 
Plan be distributed except for any amounts, and any interest or dividend 
equivalents credited thereon, which were deferred in the calendar year 




                               85 of 109 

in which the request for distribution is submitted.  To the extent 
required for exemption from Section 16, distributions prior to 
termination of employment shall not be permitted under this Plan from 
amounts deferred to a Stock Unit account by a Participant who is subject 
to Section 16, except in the case of the Participant's disability.  
Disability, for these purposes, shall mean a condition entitling the 
Participant to Disability Retirement under the Company's Retirement 
Plan.  For Participants subject to Section 16, no change to the timing 
of or payment option for payments from a Stock Unit account shall be 
considered or allowed during the period the Participant is subject to 
Section 16 and for any required Section 16 reporting period thereafter.
The Committee may establish guidelines for its own use in considering 
any such request or any other request or election under the Plan, but 
such guidelines shall not in any way limit the Committee's discretion in 
acting upon a request or election, or in determining the timing and 
manner of any distributions to be made under the Plan.

Distributions under the Plan shall be subject to withholding for taxes 
and other charges, as required by law, and the Company shall deduct from 
any such distribution any amounts owed by the Participant to the 
Company.  For those distributions in stock, required withholding will be 
taken from the common stock which would have been received.

6.   Beneficiaries.  A Participant may designate one or more beneficiaries to 
receive distributions from the Plan, upon the death of the Participant.  
If no beneficiary has been designated, all such amounts shall be paid to 
the personal representative of the Participant.  Except as provided in 
the following paragraph, the death of a Participant shall not affect the 
timing or manner of distributions from the Participant's account.
A Participant may elect that one or more fixed payments be made from his 
account under the Plan, to his personal representative or designated 
beneficiary, following his death.  Such payments, if approved by the 
Committee, shall be made within 15 months after the Participant's death.  
Any amounts thereafter remaining in the account will be distributed at 
the time and in the manner approved by the Committee.

7.   Termination or Amendment of the Plan.  This Plan may be terminated, 
modified, or amended from time to time by resolution of the Board of 
Directors.  If the Plan is terminated, all amounts accumulated prior to 
termination will continue to remain subject to the provisions of the 
Plan as if the Plan had not been terminated.
















                               86 of 109 

8.   Participant's Rights.  Amounts deferred and accumulated under the Plan 
remain the property of the Company, and no Participant or other person 
shall acquire any property interest in the account or any other assets 
of the Company on account of participation in the Plan, the 
Participant's rights being limited to receiving from the Company the 
payments provided for in the Plan.  The Plan is unfunded, and to the 
extent that any Participant acquires a right to receive payments from 
the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured 
creditor of the Company.

Except to the extent provided in the final paragraph of Section 5 of the 
Plan, the right of a Participant, his legal representative or 
beneficiary to receive payments from the Plan shall not be subject to 
anticipation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, nor shall 
such right be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities 
or torts of the Participant, his legal representative or beneficiaries.

9.   Powers of Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee of the 
Board of Directors (the "Committee") shall have full power and authority 
to construe and interpret this Plan.  Decisions of the Committee shall 
be final and binding upon the Participants, their legal representatives 
and beneficiaries.  Approval by the Committee of any election or request 
made by a Participant pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to the sole 
discretion of the Committee.

                     Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors
                 of The Boeing Company as amended October 25, 1993











































                               88 of 109 

                         DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR
                         DIRECTORS OF THE BOEING COMPANY

1. Purpose.  The purpose of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors of 
The Boeing Company (the "Plan") is to provide for deferral of payment of 
all or a portion of any annual fees, meeting fees, or both, payable to 
members of the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company (the "Company").

2.   Eligibility.  Any member of the Company's Board of Directors entitled to 
compensation as a director is eligible to elect to participate in the 
Plan.

3.   Election to Participate.  A director may elect to defer all or a 
specified percentage of annual fees, meeting fees, or both, that may 
thereafter become payable, by executing and delivering to the Company a 
notice which states the percentage of the fees to be deferred and the 
deferral account to which the fees are to be credited.  An election or 
change in election must be made by December 1 to be effective for fees 
to be paid in the following year.

An election to participate will remain in effect until participation in 
the Plan terminates, or until the election is changed by a notice to the 
Company increasing or decreasing the percentage of fees to be deferred, 
or changing the account for  future deferrals.  If a Director or former 
Director having an account under the Plan (a "Participant") terminates 
participation in the Plan, all amounts accumulated in the Participant's 
account(s) prior to termination will continue to be held subject to the 
Plan.

4.   Deferral Accounts.  All fees deferred under the Plan shall be credited 
to the Participant either in an Interest Credit deferral account or in a 
Stock Unit deferral  account, at the election of the Participant, such 
election to be irrevocable once made.  In the absence of an election, 
the Interest Credit deferral account shall be credited.  Fees shall be 
credited at the time the fees otherwise are payable.
Each Participant's account(s) shall be credited with earnings thereon as 
follows: 

Interest Credit Deferral Account.  As of March 31, June 30, 
September 30, and December 31 each year, a Participant's Interest Credit 
deferral account shall be credited with interest on all amounts in that 
account during the preceding quarter.

Interest will be computed during each calendar year at the mean between 
the high and the low during the first eleven months of the preceding 
year of yields on Aa-rated Industrial Bonds as reported by Moody's 
Investors Service, Inc., rounded to the nearest 1/4th of one percent.  
The Company will notify Participants annually of the established 
interest rate.
Stock Unit Deferral Account.  At the time the fee is credited, the 
Participant's Stock Unit deferral account shall be credited with the 
number of shares of the Company's common stock that could be purchased 
with the fee, based on the Fair Market Value of such stock on the day 
the fee is credited (or on the next business day on which the Exchange 



                               89 of 109 

is open, if the Exchange is closed on the day the fee is credited), 
excluding commissions, taxes, and other charges; and such number 
(carried to two decimal places) shall be recorded as stock units in the 
Participant's account, for bookkeeping purposes only.  For purposes of 
the Plan, "Fair Market Value" equals the mean of the high and low per 
share trading prices for the common stock of the Company as reported in 
The Wall Street Journal for the "New York Stock Exchange - Composite 
Transactions" for a single trading day.  The number of stock units in an 
account shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock 
dividends, and other like adjustments in the Company's common stock.
Each Participant's Stock Unit deferral account periodically shall be 
credited with the number of shares of the Company's common stock that 
could be purchased, as set forth in the preceding paragraph, by an 
amount equal to the cash dividends that would be payable on the number 
of shares of the Company's common stock that equals the number of stock 
units in a Participant's Stock Unit deferral account.  The Company will 
notify Participants annually of the number of stock units, and the 
dividend equivalents, credited to their Stock Unit deferral account.
The Committee may authorize an irrevocable one-time election by 
Participants to elect the Stock Unit deferral account for Plan balances 
as of December 31, 1993.

5.   Payment.  The timing and manner of distribution of amounts held under 
the Plan shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, 
but distributions shall commence no earlier than as set forth in this 
section.  Distributions must commence no later than the January 15 
immediately following:  (a) the year in which the Participant reaches 
age 70-1/2 or, (b) if the Participant continues service on the Board 
beyond such age, the year the Participant retires from the Board or 
otherwise terminates service from the Board.  A Participant may submit 
an election to the Committee, stating the number of years over which the 
Participant requests that payment be made (which shall be between 1 
and 15 years), the initial year of payment, and the payment option (in 
the case of payments to be made over 2 or more years).  The election 
shall be submitted to the Committee by not later than December 1 of the 
year in which the Participant retires from the Board or otherwise 
terminates service from the Board.  The distribution shall be made in 
accordance with the election unless the Committee determines that the 
distribution should be made at some different time or in some different 
manner.

The payment options (in the case of payments to be made over 2 or more 
years) shall be as follows:

    Approximately Equal Option.  The amount payable to the Participant 
each year shall be computed so that the aggregate amount of cash 
or stock in a Participant's account(s) under the Plan shall be 
distributed in approximately equal installments in each year for 
which deferred compensation payments are to be made; or
    Fractional Option.  The amount payable to the Participant each 
year shall be computed by multiplying a fraction, the numerator of 
which is one and the denominator of which is the number of years 
remaining in the distribution period, by the balance in the 
account(s) on January 1 of such year.



                               90 of 109 

Under either option, the Participant's account(s) shall be debited at 
the time of payment, which shall be on or before January 15 of each 
year.

An approved payment period and payment option shall be applicable to the 
Participant's total aggregate deferred compensation accounts under the 
Plan, including any accounts previously maintained that have been 
combined into an account under this Plan.  Participants who have filed 
elections prior to January 1, 1993, may by December 1, 1993, revise such 
elections (subject to Committee approval) to reflect the payment periods 
and payment options permitted by the foregoing provisions, or may cancel 
such elections and defer making an election until such time as is 
permitted by the foregoing provisions.

Distributions of amounts from a Stock Unit deferral account shall be 
paid in cash during any period in which the Participant is subject to 
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and 
regulations thereunder ("Section 16"), and for any required Section 16 
reporting period thereafter.  Following such period, distributions from 
the Stock Unit deferral account may be made in stock at the written 
election of the Participant, subject to Committee approval.  Any cash 
distribution shall equal the cash value, on the date as of which the 
distribution is calculated (which shall be the first business day in 
January unless some other date is prescribed by the Committee), of the 
number of whole shares of Company common stock then distributable to 
such Participant, based on the Fair Market Value of such stock on that 
date or the next day on which the Exchange is open, if the Exchange is 
closed on the date the distribution is calculated.  Any distributions in 
stock shall be in whole shares of the Company's common stock equal to 
the whole number of stock units credited to the Participant's Stock Unit 
deferral account.  No fractional shares shall be distributed and any 
account balance remaining after a stock distribution shall be paid in 
cash.

A Participant may request that amounts (except for any amounts, and any 
interest  credited thereon, which were deferred in the calendar year in 
which the request for distribution is submitted) credited to the 
Participant's Interest Credit deferral account be distributed during the 
Participant's term of office as a director of the Company, or that an 
approved method of payment of the account be changed.  Any such request 
must be submitted to the Committee by no later than December 1 of the 
year prior to the year in which the distribution is requested to be 
made, must set forth the reason therefor, and is subject to approval by 
the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion.  Distributions during 
a Participant's term of office as a director of the Company shall not be 
permitted under the Plan from amounts deferred to a Stock Unit deferral 
account, except in the case of the Participant's disability.  
Disability, for these purposes, shall mean a condition entitling the 
Participant to Disability Retirement under the Company's Retirement Plan 
as if such Retirement Plan were applicable to the Participant.  No 
change to the timing of or payment option for payments from the Stock 
Unit deferral account shall be considered or allowed during the period 
the Participant is subject to Section 16 and for any required Section 16 
reporting period thereafter.



                               91 of 109 

The Committee may establish guidelines for its own use in considering 
any such request or any other request or election under the Plan, but 
such guidelines shall not in any way limit the Committee's discretion in 
acting upon a request or election, or in determining the timing and 
manner of any distributions to be made under the Plan.

6.   Beneficiaries.  A Participant may designate one or more beneficiaries to 
receive distributions from the Plan, upon the death of the Participant.  
If no beneficiary has been designated, all such amounts shall be paid to 
the personal representative of the Participant.  Except as provided in 
the following paragraph, the death of a Participant shall not affect the 
timing or manner of distributions from the Participant's account(s).
A Participant may elect that one or more fixed payments be made from the 
Participant's account(s) under the Plan, to the Participant's personal 
representative or designated beneficiary, following the Participant's 
death.  Such payments, if approved by the Committee, shall be made 
within 15 months after the Participant's death.  Any amounts thereafter 
remaining in the account(s) will be distributed at the time and in the 
manner approved by the Committee.

7.   Termination or Amendment of the Plan.  The Plan may be terminated, 
modified, or amended from time to time by resolution of the Board of 
Directors.  If the Plan is terminated, all amounts accumulated prior to 
termination will continue to remain subject to the provisions of the 
Plan as if the Plan had not been terminated.

8.   Participants' Rights.  Amounts deferred and accumulated under the Plan 
remain the property of the Company, and no Participant or other person 
shall acquire any property interest in the account(s) or any other 
assets of the Company on account of participation in the Plan, a 
Participant's rights being limited to receiving from the Company the 
payments provided for in the Plan.  The Plan is unfunded, and to the 
extent that any Participant acquires a right to receive payments from 
the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured 
creditor of the Company.

Except to the extent provided in the final paragraph of Section 5 of the 
Plan, the right of a Participant, the Participant's legal representative 
or beneficiary to receive payments from the Plan shall not be subject to 
anticipation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, nor shall 
such right be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities 
or torts of the Participant, or the Participant's legal representative 
or beneficiaries.

9.   Powers of Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee of the 
Board of Directors (the "Committee") shall have full power and authority 
to construe and interpret the Plan.  No member of the Committee shall 
act on any matter concerning such member's participation in the Plan or 
such member's account(s) under the Plan.  Decisions of the Committee 
shall be final and binding upon the Participants, their legal 
representatives and beneficiaries.  Approval by the Committee of any 
election or request made by a Participant pursuant to the Plan shall be 
subject to the sole discretion of the Committee.

                       1993 Incentive Stock Plan for Employees
                          as amended on December 13, 1993

                       THE BOEING COMPANY

               1993 Incentive Stock Plan for Employees
                    As Amended December 13, 1993


1.   Purpose.
The purpose of this 1993 Incentive Stock Plan for Employees (the "Plan") 
is to attract, retain and motivate key employees by providing them the 
opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the The Boeing Company 
(the "Company") and to link their interests and efforts to the long-term 
interests of the Company's shareholders.

2.   Plan Administration.
2.1   The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (the 
"Committee") of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board").  Except 
for the terms and conditions explicitly set forth in the Plan, the 
Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to determine all 
matters relating to awards under the Plan, including selection of the 
individuals to be granted awards, the type of awards, the number of 
shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Common Stock") subject to an 
award, all terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations, if any, of an 
award and the terms of any award agreement or notice.

2.2   The Committee shall also have the authority to grant awards in 
fulfillment of commitments previously made for stock-based awards under 
the "Incentive Compensation Plan for Officers and Employees of The Boeing 
Company and Subsidiaries."

2.3   Except for the power to amend the Plan as provided in Section 12, the 
Board or the Committee, in its discretion, may delegate the Committee's 
authority and duties under the Plan to a committee appointed by the Board 
consisting of one or more senior executive officers of the Company who 
are also members of the Board, under such conditions and limitations as 
the Board or the Committee may establish, except that only the Committee 
may make any determinations regarding grants or awards to participants 
who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
"1934 Act").

2.4   All decisions made by the Committee or its delegate pursuant to the 
provisions of the Plan and all determinations and selections made by the 
Committee or its delegate pursuant to such provisions and related orders 
or resolutions of the Board shall be final and conclusive.

3.   Eligibility.
Any employee of the Company shall be eligible to receive an award under 
the Plan.  For purposes of this Section 3, the "Company," with respect to 
all awards under the Plan other than Incentive Stock Options, includes 
any entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by 


the Company or any entity in which the Company has a significant equity 
interest, as determined by the Committee.  With respect to Incentive 
Stock Options, the "Company" includes any parent or subsidiary of the 
Company in accordance with Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as amended (the "Code").

                               94 of 109 

4.   Shares Subject to the Plan.
4.1   The stock offered under the Plan shall be shares of Common Stock and may
be unissued shares or shares now held or subsequently acquired by the 
Company as treasury shares, as the Board may from time to time determine.  
Subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 4.3 and 5, the aggregate 
number of shares to be delivered under the Plan shall not exceed fourteen 
million (14,000,000) shares, of which no more than an aggregate of two 
million (2,000,000) shares shall be available for issuance pursuant to 
stock awards granted under Section 6.4.

4.2   Any shares subject to any award granted under the Plan which is 
forfeited, is terminated or expires unexercised shall again be available 
for award under the Plan, subject to the limitations contained in 
applicable laws and regulations.

4.3   The Board, in its sole discretion, may increase the aggregate number of 
shares of Common Stock to be delivered under Section 4.1 by up to two 
million (2,000,000) shares in the event that the Company acquires any 
other corporation or business entity and the Company agrees to assume 
outstanding employee stock options or stock grant commitments of the 
acquired entity or otherwise grants awards to employees in connection 
with such acquisition.

5.   Adjustment of Shares Available.
The aggregate number of shares available for awards under the Plan, the 
number of shares covered by each outstanding award, and the exercise 
price per share thereof (but not the total price) of each such award 
shall all be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the 
number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from any split-up or 
consolidation of shares or any like capital adjustment or the payment of 
any stock dividend.

6.   Awards.
6.1   The Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to 
determine the type or types of award(s) to be granted to employees.  Such 
awards may include, but are not limited to, Incentive Stock Options, 
Nonqualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem 
with all or a portion of related stock options under the Plan or Stock 
Awards.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5 hereof, no more 
than 3% of the number of shares authorized by Section 4.1, which equates 
to 420,000 shares, may be issued to any one individual in any one year.


6.2   Stock Options.  The Committee may grant stock options designated as 
"Incentive Stock Options," which comply with the provisions of Section 
422 of the Code or any successor statutory provision, or "Nonqualified 
Stock Options."  The price at which shares may be purchased upon exercise 
of a particular option shall be determined by the Committee but shall be 
no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of such shares at the time 
such option is granted.  For purposes of the Plan, "Fair Market Value" 
equals the mean of the high and low per share trading prices for the 
Common Stock as reported in The Wall Street Journal for the New York 
Stock Exchange Composite Transactions for a single trading day.  The term 
of each stock option shall be set by the Committee, but no Incentive 



                               95 of 109 

Stock Option shall be exercisable more than ten years after the date such 
stock option is granted and, to the extent the aggregate Fair Market 
Value (determined as of the date the option is granted) of Common Stock 
with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the 
first time during any calendar year (under this Plan and all other stock 
option plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, such options shall be 
treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.

6.3   Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Committee may grant "Stock Appreciation 
Rights" to employees who have been or are granted stock options under the 
Plan.  In exchange for the surrender in whole or in part of the privilege 
of exercising the related option to purchase shares of the Common Stock, 
the granted Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle an employee to payment 
of an amount equal to the appreciation in value of the surrendered option 
(the excess of the Fair Market Value of such option at the time of 
surrender over its aggregate exercise price).  Such payment may be made in 
cash or in shares of Common Stock valued at the Fair Market Value as of the 
date of the surrender, or partly in cash and partly in shares of Common 
Stock, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  The 
Committee may establish an arrangement under which employees may defer any 
such cash payment to a future date or dates under terms similar to the 
terms of the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan (including the accrual of 
interest on deferred amounts), provided that an employee's election to 
defer under any such arrangement shall be made (a) on or before the date of 
grant of the Stock Appreciation Right being surrendered or (b) subject to 
approval by the Committee, before the date on which the employee becomes 
vested in the related option being surrendered.  The Committee may 
establish a maximum appreciation value payable for Stock Appreciation 
Rights.  For Stock Appreciation Rights exercised during any ten-day window 
period following the Company's release of quarterly financial information, 
the Committee may, in its sole discretion, establish a uniform Fair Market 
Value of the Common Stock for such period.  The uniform Fair Market Value 
shall not be less than the Fair Market Value otherwise available to an 
optionee and shall not be greater than the highest daily mean price during 
such ten-day period of the sales prices of the Common Stock as reported in 
The Wall Street Journal; provided, however, that with respect to Stock 
Appreciation Rights granted in connection with Incentive Stock Options, the 
Fair Market Value shall not exceed the maximum fair market value 
permissible under Section 422 of the Code.

6.4   Stock Awards.  The Committee may grant "Stock Awards" under the Plan in 
Common Stock or denominated in units of Common Stock.  Such awards may be 
granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with any other type of 
award granted under the Plan.  The Committee, in its discretion, may make 
such awards either noncontingent or contingent upon attainment of certain 
performance objectives to be achieved during a period of time, or upon 
continuous service with the Company.  The measure of whether and to what 
degree such objectives have been attained and the resulting awards will 
be determined by the Committee.  The Committee may choose, at the time of 
the grant of the award or any time thereafter up to the time of payment 
of the award, to include as part of such award an entitlement to receive 
dividends or dividend equivalents, subject to such terms as the Committee 
may establish.  All dividends or dividend equivalents which are not paid 
currently may, at the Committee's discretion, accrue interest and be paid 
to the participant if and when and to the extent that such award is paid.


                               96 of 109 

7.   Option Exercise.
7.1   Each award agreement or notice for a stock option or Stock Appreciation 
Right shall contain a provision that the option or right shall not be 
exercisable unless the optionee remains in the employ of the Company at 
least twelve months after the granting of the option.

7.2   No shares shall be delivered pursuant to the exercise of any option or 
Stock Appreciation Right, in whole or in part, until qualified for 
delivery under such securities laws and regulations as may be deemed by 
the Committee to be applicable thereto and until, in the case of the 
exercise of an option, payment in full of the option price thereof (in 
cash or stock as provided in Section 7.4) is received by the Company.  No 
holder of an option or Stock Appreciation Right, legal representative, 
legatee, or distributee shall be or be deemed to be a holder of any 
shares subject to such option or Stock Appreciation Right unless and 
until such person or entity has received a certificate or certificates 
therefor.

7.3   No option may at any time be exercised with respect to a fractional share.
In the event that shares are issued pursuant to the exercise of a Stock 
Appreciation Right, no fractional share shall be issued; however, a 
fractional Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised for cash.

7.4   An employee who owns shares of Common Stock may use the previously 
acquired shares, whose value shall be determined as the Fair Market Value 
of such shares on the date the stock option is exercised, as a form of 
payment to exercise stock options under the Plan.  The Committee, in its 
discretion, may restrict or rescind this right by notice to a participant 
in the Plan.  An option may be exercised with stock only by surrendering 
to the Company whole shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value 
equal to or less than the exercise price.  If an option is exercised by 
surrender of stock having a Fair Market Value less than the exercise 
price, the employee must pay the difference in cash.

8.   Transferability.
The right of any award recipient to exercise an award granted under the 
Plan shall, during the lifetime of such award recipient, be exercisable 
only by such award recipient and shall not be assignable or transferable 
by such award recipient other than by will or the laws of descent and 
distribution.

9.   Withholding Taxes.
The Company shall have the right to deduct from any settlement of an 
award made under the Plan, including the delivery or vesting of shares, 
an amount sufficient to cover with-holding required by law for any 
federal, state or local taxes or to take such other action as may be 
necessary to satisfy any such withholding obligations, including the 
withholding from any other cash amounts due or to become due from the 
Company to the participant an amount equal to such taxes.








                               97 of 109 

10.   Termination of Employment.
The terms and conditions under which an award may be exercised following 
termination of a participant's employment with the Company shall be 
determined by the Committee, provided, that if a participant's employment 
with the Company terminates for any reason within twelve months of the 
date of grant of a stock option or Stock Appreciation Right, such option 
or right shall expire as of the date of such termination of employment 
and the participant and the participant's legal representative shall 
forfeit any and all rights pertaining to such award.

11.   Term of the Plan.
The Plan shall become effective as of May 1, 1993 and shall remain in 
full force and effect through April 30, 1998 unless sooner terminated by 
the Board.  After termination of the Plan, no future awards may be 
granted but awards previously granted shall remain outstanding in 
accordance with their applicable terms and conditions and the terms and 
conditions of the Plan.

12.   Plan Amendment.
The Committee or the Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at 
any time, provided that no such amendment shall be made without approval 
of the Company's stockholders if such approval is required to comply with 
Rule 16b-3 under the 1934 Act or the Delaware General Corporation Law or, 
with respect to Incentive Stock Options, Section 422 of the Code or any 
successor provision.

13.   Section 16(b) Compliance.
It is the intention of the Company that the Plan shall comply in all 
respects with Rule 16b-3 under the 1934 Act and, if any Plan provision is 
later found not to be in compliance with Section 16 of the 1934 Act, the 
provision shall be deemed null and void, and in all events the Plan shall 
be construed in favor of its meeting the requirements of Rule 16b-3.  
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Board, in its
